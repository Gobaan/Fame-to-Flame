Chevron are looking to prepare a hostile bid for BP, the troubled oil giant is trading at its highest level since June 8. But is a colossal merger of this kind really feasible? The rumor mill began following a Financial Times report that the Obama administration told Exxon Mobil to "take a look" at BP. However, the following business writers think any such merger is highly unlikely. Here's why: It Just Doesn't Add Up, writes Elizabeth Souder at the Dallas News: "I don't see why the profitable company would file for bankruptcy -- or why the British would allow that to happen, with so many pensioners relying on BP dividends. And I am baffled by the idea that Irving's Exxon Mobil Corp. might try to buy BP and all its problems. Why would a company that only recently put its own spill behind it, buy somebody else's environmental disaster? ...I also think there's the problem of BP's safety record and poor public image." A 'Legal Nightmare,' explains Paul La Monica at CNN Money: "Why would any company want to inherit the massive legal headache associated with all the claims tied to the Gulf of Mexico spill? Sure, Exxon Mobil may be best equipped to deal with BP given that it was able to move on from the Valdez disaster in 1989 and is now the most valuable company in the U.S. But are BP's assets really worth the hassle? ...Plus, one would have to imagine that any takeover of BP would lead to a long, protracted antitrust review that could take months, if not years... That process would likely need to take place by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic." BP Is Too Expensive, writes Michael Corkery at The Wall Street Journal: "The likelihood that Exxon Mobil could swallow the entire $113 billion market cap BP seems remote. Exxon has only begun to digest its $41 billion acquisition of natural gas producer XTO in a deal that has been poorly received by investors. Exxon Mobil has generated total returns of -18% (include share price returns and dividends) since the deal was announced in December, compared with -2% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index and the -8% return by rival Chevron. Investors worry that it could take several years before the natural-gas market and broader economy improves to justify the deal, according to J.P. Morgan Chase analyst Fred Lucas."

BP is implementing a plan to place a new cap on the broken well that has been spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico for almost three months. The old cap merely slowed the flow of oil, but BP hopes that this one could contain all of it by providing a full seal. The operation requires temporarily lifting the existing cap, however, which has increased the flow of oil. Here's what we're facing and the current status of the attempt. BP Cites Good Progress So Far The Washington Post's Lyndsey Layton writes , "In a complicated subsea dance involving robots and hardware, BP made progress Sunday in its effort to install a new, secure cap on the gushing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, but the company says that it is early in the week-long project and that the oil is spewing as skimmers try to capture the newly vigorous flow of crude. ... the maneuvers, which are being conducted in large part by robotic submarines a mile under the water's surface, are going smoothly partly because of a window of good weather and calm seas." How BP Will Test the Cap The Wall Street Journal's Susan Daker reports , "Once the cap is installed, the company will perform a series of pressure tests to ascertain the wellbore's integrity, Mr. Suttles said. The pressure tests could take a minimum of 48 hours. ... High pressure would be positive news indicating the integrity of the well is good and that the cap is collecting all of the oil, Mr. Suttles said. Low pressure would indicate oil is escaping and the leak is not fully contained, he said. In that case, the company would have to rely on its containment ships to continue to produce oil from the well." Battered Gulf Coast Residents Watch Warily The Associated Press' Tom Breen and Colleen Long write, "While the operation is under way, the previous cap had to be removed -- meaning all of the oil is escaping unfettered until the new cap can be installed. Still, the chance to capture all the oil was a welcome bit of news 83 days into the environmental and economic disaster that has fouled the Gulf and its fragile coastline. After more than two months of failed efforts, there remains a healthy dose of skepticism among those who live and work along the coast."

"This test involves closing one or more of the valves on the new cap for a period of time to allow BP to measure pressures in the well," retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. The process could take anywhere from six hours to two days, or longer if BP extends them. Officials say several scenarios are possible: the cap could contain all the oil; the cap could contain some of the crude while ships on the water's surface collect the rest; or, under a worst-case scenario, there could be more damage to the well's casing, meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing. Before testing began, some oil continued to gush from the upper section of the new, 18-foot, 150,000-pound cap. Allen, who is leading the federal response to the environmental disaster, said Monday scientists will be checking the pressure inside the well, and then determining whether the cap is holding the oil in or if ships will need to continue siphoning oil. A critical step is making sure there's no hydrate buildup, according to BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. In the best-case scenario, the containment cap would have the ability to close down the valves and slowly contain all the oil, Allen said. If oil collection is still necessary, BP said it has more resources at its disposal. The oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, was put in place Monday to recover oil, joining the Q4000, which is already active. And Allen said the new cap offers a significant advantage: four collection ships could connect to the well, rather than the maximum of three allowed by the old cap. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day could be collected as part of the containment process, according to BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells. As robots put the new cap in place, Allen emphasized that work was also continuing on two relief wells, which he called "the final solution" to shutting down the leaking well. BP's Suttles said Monday that because the first relief well is five feet away from the main well, BP was estimating "kill" operations to shut down the main well could take place at the end of the month. "We're getting really, really close, it looks to me like, to at least stopping the oil," said Ed Overton, Louisiana State University professor emeritus of environmental science. "The ultimate solution, of course, is the relief well that will seal the damaged well for good... But getting the oil stopped at this point is a gigantic, gigantic step forward." Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well, causing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. The presidential commission tasked with investigating the Gulf oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling will continue its public meetings Tuesday. The National Oil Spill Commission has six months to determine what happened when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again. A new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the U.S. Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings. The government said the new moratorium, which could be in effect through November 30, is to "protect communities, coasts, and wildlife" while oil and gas companies implement safety measures to reduce the risks of blowouts and oil spills associated with deepwater drilling. But Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana told the presidential commission that the new moratorium was "unnecessary, ill-conceived and a second economic disaster for the Gulf Coast." Cherri Foytlin, whose husband works for a firm that supplies tools to drilling companies, agreed. "What I want the commission to walk away with is that we are people down here, and the moratorium and the oil spill affects people and not just big companies. When you rage against big oil like BP and Exxon, you're really raging against me," she said. CNN's Campbell Brown contributed to this report.

Ugandan officials have recovered an explosives-laden belt from a residential area as the investigation continued Tuesday into a trio of bombings that killed at least 74 people, authorities said. Police find explosive device in Uganda discotheque - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Police find explosive device in Uganda discotheque By the CNN Wire Staff Survivors are seen at an Ethiopian-owned restaurant in the Kabalagala area of Kampala late on Sunday moments after twin bomb blasts tore through crowds of football fans watching the World Cup final. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW : Police: Device is found in a trashcan NEW : Police: Device is similar to those found at sites of blasts NEW: Al Qaeda congratulates Al-Shabaab Somali PM: "Civilized world" should unite to combat Al-Shabaab (CNN) -- Ugandan officials have recovered what they've alternately described as an explosives-laden belt or a vest in a trashcan at a nightclub in a suburb of Kampala, the chief of police said Tuesday. Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, the chief of police, said the device -- found Monday -- was impregnated with ball bearings and was similar to those found at two sites where blasts killed at least 74 people over the weekend. The device was found along with a detonator and what looked like a laptop bag, Kayihura said. When a journalist asked him whether this meant there was a third attack planned, he said, "It's possible there was."The police chief said that his office was working with international agencies -- but would not specify who. He also would not say how many people have been arrested in connection with the attack and what their nationalities were. Why is Uganda so important? Earlier, Fred Opolot, executive director of Uganda media center, said authorities had arrested several people but they have not yet been charged in connection with the attacks, Opolot said. "We are trying to find the culprits of this atrocity," he said. The blasts went off Sunday at two venues -- a restaurant and a rugby field -- where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup soccer finals. A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for a trio of bombings. "And the best of men have promised and they have delivered," said an Arabic statement issued by Al-Shabaab's press office and obtained by CNN. "Blessed and exalted among men -- (taking) full responsibility. ...We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response." The 6,000 is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. "We are behind the attack because we are at war with them," Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. "We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country. We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us," Rage said. Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali-Sharmarke called on the "civilized world to unite in stopping the mindless terror enterprise of Al-Shabab." "We will work with our partners in Uganda and the international community in bringing the cowards responsible for this heinous act," the prime minister said in a statement released Monday. Meanwhile, al Qaeda congratulated Al-Shabaab in a message posted on pro-jihad web forums. "Be pleased because all the sincere Muslims are with you joining you in your moments of pleasure and difficulty," read part of the message. The 74 fatalities included 28 Ugandans, one Irish citizen, one Indian, one American and 11 people who are either Ethiopian or Eritrean, according to the Ugandan government. The blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates. Two others exploded at the rugby center. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning Tuesday, according to a government statement. All flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said.

The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team. NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James By the CNN Wire Staff Comments about LeBron James drew a $100,000 fine for Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NBA fines Cavs owner $100,000 for comments Gilbert's letter described James' departure as a "cowardly betrayal" Commissioner says Gilbert's words were "ill-advised and imprudent" Stern also criticizes James' handling of his decision to leave (CNN) -- The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert's words, "though understandable, were ill-advised and imprudent." In a letter posted on the team's website Thursday, Gilbert called James' decision to play for the Miami Heat a "cowardly betrayal" and a "shocking act of disloyalty." James, who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career, announced his decision to leave the team during a much-ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled "The Decision." In a press conference which was posted on the NBA's website Monday, Stern said that James was "certainly entitled" to leave the team, but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently. "I think that the advice that he received on this was poor. But his performance was fine. His honesty and his integrity I think shine through, but this decision was ill-conceived, badly produced and poorly executed," Stern said. Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert's letter showed a "property-owner's mentality." "Equally imprudent I believe are the remarks by my good friend Jesse Jackson, which purport to make this into a racial matter... he really is mistaken," Stern said. Before deciding to join the Miami Heat, James, a reigning two-time NBA MVP, looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland. He said it came down to one thing. "The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future." James said. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison.

A group of U.S. lawmakers have called for an investigation into whether BP may have played a role in lobbying for the release of Abdel Basset al Megrahi to secure an oil contract with the Libyan government. BP may face probe over bomber's release - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } BP may face probe over bomber's release By Jesse Solomon , CNN Convicted Pan Am bomber Abdelbaset al Megrahi boards a plane in Scotland to make his final trip home to Libya on August 20. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Senator: BP stands to earn as much as $20 billion from the deal Senators want an investigation on whether BP lobbied to secure Libyan oil contract Al Megrahi serves eight years of life sentence before his release in August He was convicted for the 1988 Pan Am bombing that killed 270 people (CNN) -- A group of U.S. lawmakers have called for an investigation into whether BP may have played a role in lobbying for the release of Abdelbaset al Megrahi to secure an oil contract with the Libyan government. Megrahi, now 58, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. He was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds in August after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. "Reports have surfaced indicating that a 2007 oil agreement may have influenced the U.K. and Scottish governments' positions concerning Mr. Megrahi's release in 2009," wrote Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in a letter to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Monday. "The families of the victims of Pan Am flight 103 deserve to know whether justice took a back seat to commercial interests in this case," Lautenberg said. Mark Salt, a spokesman for BP in Houston, Texas, declined to discuss the Senators' probe. "We're not going to comment on speculation," he said. BP, which plans to begin offshore drilling in Libya in the coming months, touted the 2007 oil agreement as "the single biggest exploration financial commitment an international energy company has ever made to Libya," according to the company's website. The troubled oil giant stands to earn as much as $20 billion from the deal, according to Lautenberg. Megrahi, who only served eight years of his life sentence for the bombing, was released by a Scottish court on "compassionate" grounds, citing a doctor's opinion at the time that he was dying from prostate cancer and had only three months to live. In a letter to the British government last week, Lautenberg was joined by Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey in calling the validity of such a prognosis into question. "Mr. Al Megrahi is still alive and reportedly living in luxury," the letter said. "The doctor responsible for the key medical opinion has told the media that not only could Mr. Al Megrahi live another 10 years, but that the Libyan government had commissioned the doctor to make his assessment." In response, the British Embassy in Washington posted a letter on its website from the British ambassador to Gillibrand on defending Megrahi's release. "The decision to grant Mr. Megrahi's compassionate release was made on the basis of advice from the Director of Health at the Scottish Prison Service, who drew on the advice of a number of medical experts," the ambassador said. Brian Kelly, who lost his brother in the attack and fought vigorously to deny Megrahi's freedom, said he isn't surprised that Megrahi is still alive and believes BP was directly responsible for his release. "You can't allow the process of justice to be corrupted by the cynical mercantilism of one company," Kelly said.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opens hearings into the safety of the diabetes drug Avandia on Tuesday after a scathing report that suggested the drug may be more dangerous than previously reported. FDA hearings set for diabetes drug Avandia - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } FDA hearings set for diabetes drug Avandia By the CNN Wire Staff FDA hearings on the safety of diabetes drug Avandia open Tuesday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS FDA panel could vote to remove the drug from the market Study concludes Avandia raises heart attack risk FDA criticizes drug company study that claimed otherwise Drug is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opens hearings into the safety of the diabetes drug Avandia on Tuesday after a scathing report that suggested the drug may be more dangerous than previously reported. An FDA advisory panel will hear two days of testimony about the drug, and could vote on whether to remove the drug from the market. Its manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, says several trials have shown the drug is safe -- but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study concluded that Avandia raised the risk of heart attacks and other heart problems. Avandia is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics. A strongly worded FDA report, released Friday, sharply criticized a Glaxo study released that painted a more reassuring picture of the drug. That study, known as RECORD, found no increased risk of heart problems. But the FDA found Glaxo researchers repeatedly submitted sloppy data and failed to follow up on reports of problems in patients -- including reports of patient deaths. Dr. Thomas Marciniak, the author of the FDA analysis, called the study's design "inappropriate and biased." "I've been following the FDA for 20 years," said Dr. Steven Nissen, whose 2007 study found Avandia users had a 43 percent higher risk of heart attacks than patients who used other drugs. "I've never seen an FDA review as blistering as his review of the record trial." Nissen is scheduled to deliver a presentation to the FDA on Monday. The agency's advisory board voted in 2007 to keep Avandia on the market, in part because of Glaxo's RECORD study. Dr. Murray Stewart, the company's vice president for clinical development, said last week that six clinical studies -- not just the one criticized by the FDA -- "show that this medicine does not increase the overall risk of heart attack, stroke or death." "There's just no evidence of an increase in heart attacks," he said. "What's more, all the clinical trials show no evidence in mortality versus standard of care. They all show decreased mortality." CNN's Caleb Hellerman and Dr. Sanjay Gupta contributed to this report.

The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs will hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon into the safety lapses at the John Cochran VA Medical Center, Missouri. Lawmakers probe hospital that may have infected veterans with HIV - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Lawmakers probe hospital that may have infected veterans with HIV By the CNN Wire Staff Rep. Russ Carnahan is calling for an investigation into safety lapses at John Cochran VA Medical Center in St. Louis. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Patients may be at risk to contract hepatitis and HIV House committee is holding a hearing about issue Hospital says problem stems from handwashing of dental instruments (CNN) -- The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs will hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon into the safety lapses at the John Cochran VA Medical Center in Missouri. The hospital is under fire because it may have exposed more than 1,800 veterans to life-threatening diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. The center in St. Louis, Missouri, recently mailed letters to 1,812 veterans telling them they could contract hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after visiting the medical center for dental work, said Rep. Russ Carnahan. Carnahan said in late June that he was calling for a investigation into the issue and had sent a letter to President Obama about it. "This is absolutely unacceptable," said Carnahan, a Democrat from Missouri. "No veteran who has served and risked their life for this great nation should have to worry about their personal safety when receiving much needed healthcare services from a Veterans Administration hospital." The issue stems from a failure to clean dental instruments properly, the hospital told CNN affiliate KSDK. Dr. Gina Michael, the association chief of staff at the hospital, told the affiliate that some dental technicians broke protocol by hand-washing tools before putting them in cleaning machines. The instruments were supposed to only be put in the cleaning machines, Michael said. The hand-washing started in February 2009 and went on until March of this year, the hospital told KSDK. The hospital has set up a special clinic and education centers to help patients who may have been infected. However, Carnahan said he feels more should be done and those responsible should be disciplined. "I can only imagine the horror and anger our veterans must be feeling after receiving this letter," Carnahan said. "They have every right to be angry. So am I." This is not the first time this year a hospital has been in hot water for not following proper procedures. In June, Palomar Hospital in San Diego, California, sent certified letters to 3,400 patients who underwent colonoscopy and other similar procedures, informing the patients that there may be a potential of infection from items used and reused in the procedures.

A Justice Department official said Monday the United States was "deeply disappointed" with the decision by Switzerland's Justice Ministry to free filmmaker Roman Polanski instead of extraditing him to America to face sentencing for unlawful sex with a child. U.S. government disappointed over Swiss ruling on Polanski - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } U.S. government disappointed over Swiss ruling on Polanski By the CNN Wire Staff Swiss court will not extradite Polanski STORY HIGHLIGHTS U.S. officials express disappointment over Switzerland's refusal to extradite Roman Polanski Celebrated film director fled America decades ago before being sentenced on a child sex charge Polanski was arrested in Switzerland last year Washington (CNN) -- A Justice Department official said Monday the United States was "deeply disappointed" with the decision by Switzerland's Justice Ministry to free filmmaker Roman Polanski instead of extraditing him to America to face sentencing for unlawful sex with a child. Polanski pleaded guilty in Los Angeles, California, in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, then fled to Europe before he was sentenced. He was arrested in Switzerland last year and had been fighting extradition since then. The Swiss Justice Ministry said Monday it was rejecting the U.S. request for extradition, meaning Polanski was now free. "We are deeply disappointed," said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division. "We thought our extradition request was supported by the facts. We're going to review our options." Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley also expressed disappointment, saying that the United States "believes that the rape of a 13-year-old child by an adult is a crime" and would continue to pursue justice in the case. Asked about comments by the Swiss attorney general that suggested technical errors in the U.S. extradition request, Crowley said: "A 13-year-girl was drugged and raped by an adult -- this is not a matter of technicality." CNN's Elise Labott and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.

The Church of England took a small step toward allowing women to serve as bishops Monday, with its governing body voting to recommend their elevation despite warnings from traditionalists that it could split the church. Church of England takes a step toward women bishops - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Church of England takes a step toward women bishops By the CNN Wire Staff Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams backed a compromise, but the the General Synod rejected it. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Church of England leaders support women as bishops Final approval some time off Supporters call decision "a powerful mandate" Opponents say they're not splitting yet London, England (CNN) -- The Church of England took a small step toward allowing women to serve as bishops Monday, with its governing body voting to recommend their elevation despite warnings from traditionalists that it could split the church. Church leaders meeting in York overwhelmingly supported changing canon law to accommodate women as bishops. But the move by the church's General Synod must be approved at a future meeting of the governing body, after parishes take at least a year to consider the question. "This is good news for the whole church, and we are delighted," the Rev. Rachel Weir, leader of the group Women and the Church, which supported the change. The decision "gives the church a powerful mandate to move forward enthusiastically, welcoming the ministry of women at all levels within the church, whilst making space for those who are opposed to stay within our body," Weir said in a statement applauding the vote. The Church of England first began ordaining women as priests in 1994 and has been debating whether they should become bishops since 2005. But the issue, along with the debate over the ordination of gay priests, has put a serious strain on the 77-million-member Anglican Communion worldwide. The Catholic Church has reached out to disaffected Anglicans, raising the possibility that conservatives could leave en masse. The General Synod rejected a compromise backed by the nominal head of the church, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, over the weekend, with priests rejecting the measure despite the support of bishops and lay leaders. Forward in Faith, a conservative group that opposes the ordination of women as "contrary to the scriptures," said Monday's vote "contains nothing which can satisfy the legitimate needs" of its members. "Now, though, is not the time for precipitate action," it said. Its leaders will take stock and debate the issue at upcoming meetings in September and October, the group said in a statement on the decision.

Chevron are looking to prepare a hostile bid for BP, the troubled oil giant is trading at its highest level since June 8. But is a colossal merger of this kind really feasible? The rumor mill began following a Financial Times report that the Obama administration told Exxon Mobil to "take a look" at BP. However, the following business writers think any such merger is highly unlikely. Here's why: It Just Doesn't Add Up, writes Elizabeth Souder at the Dallas News: "I don't see why the profitable company would file for bankruptcy -- or why the British would allow that to happen, with so many pensioners relying on BP dividends. And I am baffled by the idea that Irving's Exxon Mobil Corp. might try to buy BP and all its problems. Why would a company that only recently put its own spill behind it, buy somebody else's environmental disaster? ...I also think there's the problem of BP's safety record and poor public image." A 'Legal Nightmare,' explains Paul La Monica at CNN Money: "Why would any company want to inherit the massive legal headache associated with all the claims tied to the Gulf of Mexico spill? Sure, Exxon Mobil may be best equipped to deal with BP given that it was able to move on from the Valdez disaster in 1989 and is now the most valuable company in the U.S. But are BP's assets really worth the hassle? ...Plus, one would have to imagine that any takeover of BP would lead to a long, protracted antitrust review that could take months, if not years... That process would likely need to take place by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic." BP Is Too Expensive, writes Michael Corkery at The Wall Street Journal: "The likelihood that Exxon Mobil could swallow the entire $113 billion market cap BP seems remote. Exxon has only begun to digest its $41 billion acquisition of natural gas producer XTO in a deal that has been poorly received by investors. Exxon Mobil has generated total returns of -18% (include share price returns and dividends) since the deal was announced in December, compared with -2% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index and the -8% return by rival Chevron. Investors worry that it could take several years before the natural-gas market and broader economy improves to justify the deal, according to J.P. Morgan Chase analyst Fred Lucas."

BP is implementing a plan to place a new cap on the broken well that has been spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico for almost three months. The old cap merely slowed the flow of oil, but BP hopes that this one could contain all of it by providing a full seal. The operation requires temporarily lifting the existing cap, however, which has increased the flow of oil. Here's what we're facing and the current status of the attempt. BP Cites Good Progress So Far The Washington Post's Lyndsey Layton writes , "In a complicated subsea dance involving robots and hardware, BP made progress Sunday in its effort to install a new, secure cap on the gushing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, but the company says that it is early in the week-long project and that the oil is spewing as skimmers try to capture the newly vigorous flow of crude. ... the maneuvers, which are being conducted in large part by robotic submarines a mile under the water's surface, are going smoothly partly because of a window of good weather and calm seas." How BP Will Test the Cap The Wall Street Journal's Susan Daker reports , "Once the cap is installed, the company will perform a series of pressure tests to ascertain the wellbore's integrity, Mr. Suttles said. The pressure tests could take a minimum of 48 hours. ... High pressure would be positive news indicating the integrity of the well is good and that the cap is collecting all of the oil, Mr. Suttles said. Low pressure would indicate oil is escaping and the leak is not fully contained, he said. In that case, the company would have to rely on its containment ships to continue to produce oil from the well." Battered Gulf Coast Residents Watch Warily The Associated Press' Tom Breen and Colleen Long write, "While the operation is under way, the previous cap had to be removed -- meaning all of the oil is escaping unfettered until the new cap can be installed. Still, the chance to capture all the oil was a welcome bit of news 83 days into the environmental and economic disaster that has fouled the Gulf and its fragile coastline. After more than two months of failed efforts, there remains a healthy dose of skepticism among those who live and work along the coast." Coast Guard Optimistic The BBC reports , "Engineers have made 'significant towards putting a new cap on the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, US Coast Guard commander Thad Allen has said.

Mitch McConnell Campaigns for Blanche Lincoln Challenger John Boozman Climate Bill on the Table, Immigration Off as Democrats Rush to Pass Priorities Nearly six months are left in 2010, but lawmakers on Capitol Hill have only a handful of work weeks left until they head home to their states and districts for an extended August recess, and then wrap up the year early in the fall to focus full time on defending their seats in Congress in the midterm elections. The compressed work schedule means that Democrats in Washington are duking it out over which issues get attention this year and which ones will have to wait for another day. The first leg of Congress' summer sprint starts Tuesday morning, when the House and Senate both return from a July 4 recess. Here's what's in and out on Congress' to do list. In : Jobs/ Unemployment Benefits -- On Tuesday, Senate Democrats will focus on a bill to jump-start small business hiring, which the Senate will debate for the rest of the week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will also bring up a perennial troublemaker for Republicans -- a bill to extend jobless benefits for long-term unemployed people. Most GOP senators have objected to passing more benefits financed by deficit spending, but Democrats are convinced they've got a political winner on their hands. So look for them to bring the bill up again and again until it passes, likely only after Gov. Joe Manchin of West Virginia appoints a temporary successor to the late Sen. Robert Byrd. With the support of the new senator and Maine's two Republican senators, the bill should pass once and for all. Out : Bush Tax Cuts -- When Republicans passed President George W. Bush's massive tax cuts in 2001, they did so only with the stipulation that the cuts would expire at the end of this year. An act of Congress could extend the expiration date, but don't hold your breath. Although some Democrats have suggested extending the Bush tax cuts for the middle class, Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for Harry Reid, said the Senate doesn't even have time to discuss it. "Because Republicans have objected to nearly everything we have tried do this year, we don't have time to do all of the things we need to do." In : Wall Street Reform -- Now that Republican Sens. Scott Brown, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe have announced they'll support the Wall Street reform bill, Harry Reid announced Monday that he'll bring the conference report of the measure -- the largest overhaul of the financial-services industry since the Great Depression -- up for a vote on final passage this week. Out : Immigration Reform -- Democrats in the House and Senate know they are nowhere near having enough votes to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill like the one President Barack Obama has advocated recently , especially in an election year. Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will not act until the Senate passes a bill, and Reid's spokeswoman says the chances are slim the issue will be taken up before November. "I don't think that's likely at this point," she said. In : Elena Kagan -- If there's a sure thing this year in Washington, it is that Elena Kagan will be confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court. Although GOP senators like John McCain have announced they'll vote against the current solicitor general to join the high court, she sailed through her confirmation hearings in June with nary a filibuster threat lodged against her. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has told reporters he wants Kagan confirmed before August, and all signs point to the fact that he'll get his wish. Likely Out Until the Fall : Pentagon policy bill, with Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal -- The 2010 Defense Authorization bill, as it's known, sets the authorized spending levels and official policies for the Pentagon next year. Of particular interest to some interest groups is the language in the bill, added by the Senate Armed Services Committee and approved by the full House, to authorize the secretary of defense to repeal the ban on gays serving openly in the military. Although the bill is expected to pass, Senate aides involved in crafting the bill give it very low odds of being taken up before August because of the Senate's full plate between now and then. In: Energy Bill/ Climate Change -- Democrats have seized on the BP oil spill as a catalyst to jump-start languishing efforts to pass energy-reform and climate-change legislation this year, which the House passed in 2009. Although the details of the bill are still being worked out between Sens. John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, Jeff Bingaman and a half dozen other interested senators, look for some version of the legislation to be debated on the Senate floor in July. Without Republican support, however, actually passing the bill will be all but impossible. Out : Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) . Although President Obama has urged the Senate to ratify the latest treaty to reduce nuclear weapons arsenals in Russia and the United States, he'll need 67 votes in the Senate to do it, a benchmark that Democratic Senate aides call "too tall of an order." A recent op-ed from Sen. Jon Kyl in The Wall Street Journal lays out the Republican arguments against ratifying it, calling the president's arms reduction policies "dangerous and impractical." Other items topping the Democrats' agenda that could come up in July include the DISCLOSE Act to place disclosure requirements on corporate campaign donations, an emergency spending bill to finance the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a food-safety bill that the first lady is advocating, and the FMAP bill to help states pay for expanding Medicaid rolls. Looming over the entire agenda will be the 2010 midterm elections, whose outcomes could be determined by the votes members of Congress take between now and then.

Mitch McConnell Campaigns for Blanche Lincoln Challenger John Boozman A Massachusetts biotechnology company said it's close to getting federal approval to bring faster-growing, genetically modified salmon to America's dinner tables, McClatchy Newspapers reported. AquaBounty said it wants to market an "advanced hybrid" of Atlantic salmon that has been genetically altered with help from a Pacific Chinook salmon. The firm said its fish aren't bigger than normal salmon, but they grow faster. If the Food and Drug Administration approves it, the salmon would be the first genetically engineered animal sold in U.S. stores. Transgenic crops such as corn and soybeans have been part of the American diet for a number of years. "I would serve it to my kids," consultant Val Giddings, former geneticist at the U.S. Agriculture Department, told McClatchey. But critics fear possible health risks from genetically modified food, and warn about a larger environmental impact. They worry genetically altered salmon could escape their aquaculture pens to compete with endangered native stocks. A Purdue University study claims that if 60 transgenic fish bred in a population of 60,000 wild fish, the wild fish would be extinct in 40 generations. "We've seen assurances in the past from industry and regulators that there won't be catastrophic consequences like the Gulf oil spill," said George Kimbrell, an attorney for the Center for Food Safety. "We have a cultural amnesia about these things." Kimbrell told McClatchy if AquaBounty's salmon are approved, his group would consider a lawsuit. The FDA doesn't comment on pending applications, though a public hearing on the AquaBounty application could come as early as this fall. If that happens, it could be a sign the FDA is close to a decision.

Mitch McConnell Campaigns for Blanche Lincoln Challenger John Boozman Disastrous Oil Spill, Fatal Horse Roundup: Blame the Interior Department Two years after a rollicking sex and drugs scandal hit the Department of the Interior, and nearly three months after the Deepwater Horizon calamity hit the Gulf of Mexico, it's clear the venerable (but rarely venerated) agency still can't get its basics right. From a forced and deadly roundup of wild horses in the red dust of northeastern Nevada to the slimy, tar-balled seas of the Gulf, the Interior Department keeps exhibiting dichotomies that are poisonous to good governance. It has stubbornly remained arrogant despite having no recently evident cause to be brash. And it continues to offer to the nation inadequate work even as its responsibilities grow in the wake of the Gulf disaster , one of the worst oil spills in world history. Let's start with a keystone. As any administrative law professor will tell you, one basic function of an administrative agency is to generate and disseminate accurate and credible and comprehensive evidence through a rigorous fact-finding process. Designed to be speedier than the judicial process and less cumbersome than federal legislation, federal administrative agencies are supposed to help us make sense of dense, technical, often-scientific information -- like why a drilling moratorium is necessary in the Gulf -- in a way that then justifies the power and authority granted to the agency and reassures the rest of us, so much as possible, of a fair deal. Yet when the Interior Department tried last month to justify in court its six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling in the Gulf, the federal judge who heard the case was flabbergasted at the lack of quality, professionalism and integrity in the work of the Minerals Management Service team within Interior. That's the same division, not coincidentally, from which the department's 2008 scandal emerged. Evidently these people aren't very good at what they do even when they aren't watching porn at work all day. Among other harsh criticisms of the government's drill-ban evidence, U.S. District Judge Martin L.C. Feldman noted a disturbing lack of candor in it: "Indeed," he wrote, "while the government makes light of the fact that several of the experts disagree with the recommendations in the Report by noting that they do not disagree with the findings, of greater concern is the misleading text in the Executive Summary that seems to assert that all the experts agree with the Secretary's recommendation. The government's hair-splitting explanation abuses reason, common sense, and the text at issue." And that's when the judge was being nice. Much was subsequently made of the fact that Judge Feldman had some oil-related investments when he issued his order denying reinstatement of the drilling ban. Evidently, the judge has now sold those stocks, but he could have increased his shares in and it still wouldn't have mattered. In fact, Feldman could have channeled Tony Hayward or Philippe Cousteau, but the MMS "report" about the drilling ban still would deserve an F. No perceived conflict of interest on the part of any judge could rescue or excuse such a shoddy work product by an administrative agency. Any judge would have seen it the way Feldman did -- and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals promptly affirmed the order, causing MMS officials to go back and try to make right what it should have gotten right in the first place. The fish, fowl and economic kill in the Gulf would be bad enough if Interior's credibility problems were merely limited to the MMS. But on Friday, far from the ocean, another Interior Department division, the Bureau of Land Management, hastily forced the roundup of 1,200 or so wild horses, including vulnerable newborn foals, in circumstances that cry out for further explanation and review. As reported locally , the BLM says the Nevada roundup was necessary because "the current wild horse population in these [public lands] is more than three times what the range can sustain. We need to gather and remove the excess wild horses to achieve a thriving natural ecological balance on the land and address the horse populations that have moved outside the [public] boundaries." Others are not so sure. Horse advocate Laura Leigh note s that there is plenty of room -- 480,000 acres, give or take a few -- for the horses. She contends that the BLM is forcing the issue now (instead of waiting until the new foals are assured of being strong enough to be herded via helicopter) because two private developments are slated for the area. One is at the Arturo Mine project, where Interior is undertaking an environmental impact study on behalf of Barrick Gold Exploration , a company that wants to expand open-pit mining to thousands of acres of public and private land. The other industry-fueled development that some say prompted the deadly mustang roundup is the Ruby Pipeline project, which for a while became so controversial that the BLM was forced to explain itself to the media. It may have to explain itself again. An animal rights group has appealed the timing of the BLM's roundup to the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The grievance in the case, oddly enough, isn't the sanctity of the animals or the rapacious development of pristine lands for private gain. It's the far more modest charge that the BLM has violated its own, longstanding and widely accepted rules about "foaling seasons"-- no roundups from mid-January to mid-August to save baby horses. Even if the BLM justification for giving the horses the bum's rush is twice as strong as was the MMS justification for the drilling ban in the Gulf, it still won't be strong enough to justify the agency's departure from the rules protecting foals. Should the sins and omissions of the MMS be impugned to the BLM? Why not? They both answer to the beleaguered secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, don't they? Nevada is a long way from the sea. But forgive me for worrying that the same guys who promised me safety in the Gulf are now promising me safety for our nation's wild horses -- or that an agency exposed as besotted with industry influence toward Gulf drilling issues is suddenly going to develop a backbone to stand up to corporate interests in the desert. It's too late for the Gulf. The damage from a lack of regulatory oversight at Interior is all but done there. I just hope it's not too late for northeastern Nevada, too.

Mitch McConnell Campaigns for Blanche Lincoln Challenger John Boozman Missouri's Proposition C Vote: 'Health Care Freedom Act' Set to Test Obamacare For those of you who have still been watching the debate over the health care reform law: something's happening next month that could take it to a whole new level. On August 3, the voters of the state of Missouri will go to the polls to cast a ballot on Proposition C , also known as the "Health Care Freedom Act." The measure has passed in the Missouri House and Senate, and it is now going straight to the people. If approved by the voters, the act would amend state statutes to effectively shield Missourians from complying with the federal health reform law, protecting them from fines and penalties, and would "prohibit any person, employer, or health care provider from being compelled to participate in any health care system." It has been nearly four months since President Obama and Democrats passed their landmark health care reform bill after weeks of intense debate. The debate has since simmered, but questions remain about the bill's future. In April, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that the bill would increase health care spending. All spring and summer, more attention has been paid to the fact that Massachusetts's similar 2006 health care law is creating significant coverage, cost, and other issues in the the state. On July 5, Rasmussen Reports found that 60 percent of Americans favor repeal of the law. And on July 7, Republican Senators (and doctors) Tom Coburn (R-OK) and John Barasso (R-WY) released a highly-critical oversight report on Obamacare's first 100 days. After months of rallies and protests for and against the bill, the American people have not yet had a single chance to actually cast a vote on Obamacare. August 3 will be the first time anywhere in the country that voters will be able to make their voices heard in a clear-cut fashion. As one blogger from Red State opposed to Obamacare phrased it: "We've been forced to speak through rallies and a diminished Republican party, until now. Now there is an opportunity for the average voter to act upon that disgust." If the Health Care Freedom Act passes in Missouri, especially by a large margin, the "repeal Obamacare" armada will be recharged. The Tea Party, conservative Republican candidates, and a plethora of advocacy groups will trumpet (and no doubt exaggerate) a huge victory against Obama's big-government agenda. The victory, of course, will be a mostly symbolic one, as courts usually rule that federal law trumps state law. In many ways what happens in Missouri may only be a small skirmish in the larger war to repeal Obamacare. However, a victory will provide a much needed morale boost to those who have been fighting for repeal since the day the legislation passed. Consider that attorney generals in twenty states (all Republicans) have filed lawsuits against the federal government, setting up an interesting White House fight in the Roberts Supreme Court. Activists in other states are also working on launching repeal efforts, at least in states where repeal is favored; meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress have relaunched their repeal push. A win in Missouri would be proof that support for repeal -- at least on a state level -- is politically sustainable nearly half a year after passage, and would spur conservative activists in other states to increase their efforts. With Democrats' attention focused on the struggling economy, high unemployment, trouble in Afghanistan, the Gulf oil spill disaster, and the looming deficit, a win in Missouri is the last thing national Democrats need right now. Yet, if the proposition passes, they will have to address it as angry voters get again question their elected officials. Proposition C's passage could even have some implications for Obama's re-election campaign in 2012. In 2008, Missouri bucked a near century-long trend of always voting for the presidential winner when John McCain won the state by a mere 4,000 votes. Missouri is considered a fine cross-section of the United States electorate, and a challenge to Obama's signature legislative accomplishment there could tell the White House that it will not play well elsewhere come 2012. Obama has made several trips to Missouri since his inauguration; if Missouri has abandoned him, the odds that states he won by 1-4 percent in 2008 (Florida, Indiana , North Carolina, Ohio) will turn their votes are significantly higher. But what if the Health Care Freedom Act fails this August? Just as a win in Missouri would be of huge promise for those who oppose Obamacare, a loss would be potentially devastating for the movement. The liberal blogosphere and activists on the ground would be filled with hope that, perhaps, Obamacare won't prove as potent a political weapon as Republicans hope. It would be one thing if this loss occurred in a blue state. But if an anti-health care reform measure can't even pass in a state that voted for John McCain, where 53 percent disapprove of Obama and 61 percent favor repeal of health care reform, what hope would such measures have elsewhere? Now that the law is officially enacted and on the books, repealing it is extremely complicated, requiring intense and persistent pressure (it can be done, though, as evidenced by the ultimate repeal of the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act). Such a defeat in Missouri, however, could harshly mitigate that pressure. The legal battles are another matter, but if politics is all about momentum, the advantage would certainly rest with Obamacare. A loss could also deal a devastating blow to the Tea Party. The movement's original fuel, back in the summer of 2009, was town halls full of voters angered over health care reform. While the movement now has become more comprehensive and addresses other issues, anger over the bureaucratic over-reach of health care reform and the backroom brokering to pass it (the Cornhusker Kickback and the Louisiana "Purchase" ) is still the driving issue for many Tea Partiers. True to form, the "Show Me" state will soon indicate just how popular (or unpopular) Obama's health care reforms are, and how resilient they can be in the face of political pressure. Perhaps even more fitting, however, is the state's official motto: Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto . "Let the welfare of the people be the Supreme Law." Next month, Missourians will judge whether they want Obamacare to be a part of the law.

Before I say anything about the content of the story, I should note that the nuclear power plant control room depicted with the storyfrom the plant at Limerick, PAis just a few miles from where I spend Christmas and about 25 miles from where my mom lives. Maybe that has affected my thoughts on the matter. But, given what Gorman has reported, Im not all that bugged about Perfect Citizen. Heres the operative bit: Intelligence officials have met with utilities CEOs and those discussions convinced them of the gravity of the threat against U.S. infrastructure, an industry specialist said, but the CEOs concluded they needed better threat information and guidance on what to do in the event of a major cyber attack. Some companies may agree to have the NSA put its own sensors on and others may ask for direction on what sensors to buy and come to an agreement about what data they will then share with the government, industry and government officials said. While the government cant force companies to work with it, it can provide incentives to urge them to cooperate, particularly if the government already buys services from that company, officials said. Perhaps Im missing something, but it seems that a somewhat coercive but nevertheless voluntary monitoring of cybersecurity for things like the nuclear plant near my Aunts home isnt such a bad thing. Perhaps an analogy is whether or not itd be okay to monitor health professionals and first responders during an epidemic for signs of sickness, as one of the best ways to track and minimize the spread of the disease. Or better yet, whether or not itd be okay to pressure oil companies to put monitors on their drilling platforms to make it easier for Department of Interior to keep track and prevent spills. That said, I do have a number of questions. First, the NSA has been very squirrely about whether or not Congress has been briefed on this. If, as that squirreliness suggests, Congress has not been briefed, then this is a big problem. Im particularly interested in the timing and the growth of this program. Gorman describes how this program started as a spring strawberry and then morphed into a perfect citizen. The NSA years ago began a small-scale effort to address this problem code-named April Strawberry, the military official said. The program researched vulnerabilities in computer networks running critical infrastructure and sought ways to close security holes. That led to initial work on Perfect Citizen, which was a piecemeal effort to forge relationships with some companies, particularly energy companies, whose infrastructure is widely used across the country. The classified program is now being expanded with funding from the multibillion-dollar Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, which started at the end of the Bush administration and has been continued by the Obama administration, officials said. This suggests this program started blossoming long before the debate over which agencyNSA or DHSwould take the lead on cybersecurity had settled on the former. Which suggests it started with NSA out of its lane under the Bush Administrationnot exactly good company to be in. So at that level, I endorse both aspects of Marc Ambinders rant on this program: that it shouldnt be classified and maybe should be in DHS. Oh, and why not name it infrastructure cybersecurity rather than George Orwells Baby? Im also very interested in the relationship between the government, corporate partners, and Congress. Given the squirreliness about whether or not NSA briefed Congress, is it possible the government has once again partnered with corporations on a project without telling Congress theyre doing so? That would not be cool. I await more information on this. But for now, Im not all that bothered about this.

( Court Filing PDF ) The heart of the class action suit, which was originally filed in October 2007, is whether consumers who entered the two-year contract with AT&amp;T did so knowing that they were actually entering a de-facto five-year contract because thats what the AT&amp;T-Apple exclusivity agreement has been reported to be. Apple has never publicly stated how long its exclusivity contract with AT&amp;T is, though a five year time periodfirst reported by USA Today back in 2007was recently confirmed through court documents related to this case. This story was originally published, under the headline Lawsuit against Apple, AT&amp;T exclusivity wins class action status at ZDNets Between the Lines.

BP robots have attached a new tighter-fitting cap on top of the gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well. BP is testing the new cap to see if it can withstand the pressure before launching the next phase which should stop the leak! Let us all hope this works. BP has been polluting the waters in the Gulf of Mexico now for nearly three months. BP is hiding a lot of facts and the world really has not seen what is really going on down in the Gulf. On June 24th, Charter Boat Captain William Allen Kruse shot himself just two weeks after being hired to skim oil for BP. Sadly BP took away the 55-year-old mans lively hood and then his life. It is truly a nightmare and I wish all of the Gulf Coast the best.

BP plans to test the new cap on its ruptured oil well in the Gulf today. The process could take from six hours to several days, officials say.

"This test involves closing one or more of the valves on the new cap for a period of time to allow BP to measure pressures in the well," retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. The process could take anywhere from six hours to two days, or longer if BP extends them. Officials say several scenarios are possible: the cap could contain all the oil; the cap could contain some of the crude while ships on the water's surface collect the rest; or, under a worst-case scenario, there could be more damage to the well's casing, meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing. Before testing began, some oil continued to gush from the upper section of the new, 18-foot, 150,000-pound cap. Allen, who is leading the federal response to the environmental disaster, said Monday scientists will be checking the pressure inside the well, and then determining whether the cap is holding the oil in or if ships will need to continue siphoning oil. A critical step is making sure there's no hydrate buildup, according to BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. In the best-case scenario, the containment cap would have the ability to close down the valves and slowly contain all the oil, Allen said. If oil collection is still necessary, BP said it has more resources at its disposal. The oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, was put in place Monday to recover oil, joining the Q4000, which is already active. And Allen said the new cap offers a significant advantage: four collection ships could connect to the well, rather than the maximum of three allowed by the old cap. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day could be collected as part of the containment process, according to BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells. As robots put the new cap in place, Allen emphasized that work was also continuing on two relief wells, which he called "the final solution" to shutting down the leaking well. BP's Suttles said Monday that because the first relief well is five feet away from the main well, BP was estimating "kill" operations to shut down the main well could take place at the end of the month. "We're getting really, really close, it looks to me like, to at least stopping the oil," said Ed Overton, Louisiana State University professor emeritus of environmental science. "The ultimate solution, of course, is the relief well that will seal the damaged well for good... But getting the oil stopped at this point is a gigantic, gigantic step forward." Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well, causing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. The presidential commission tasked with investigating the Gulf oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling will continue its public meetings Tuesday. The National Oil Spill Commission has six months to determine what happened when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again. A new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the U.S. Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings. The government said the new moratorium, which could be in effect through November 30, is to "protect communities, coasts, and wildlife" while oil and gas companies implement safety measures to reduce the risks of blowouts and oil spills associated with deepwater drilling. But Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana told the presidential commission that the new moratorium was "unnecessary, ill-conceived and a second economic disaster for the Gulf Coast." Cherri Foytlin, whose husband works for a firm that supplies tools to drilling companies, agreed. "What I want the commission to walk away with is that we are people down here, and the moratorium and the oil spill affects people and not just big companies. When you rage against big oil like BP and Exxon, you're really raging against me," she said. CNN's Campbell Brown contributed to this report.

Ugandan officials have recovered an explosives-laden belt from a residential area as the investigation continued Tuesday into a trio of bombings that killed at least 74 people, authorities said. Police find explosive device in Uganda discotheque - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Police find explosive device in Uganda discotheque By the CNN Wire Staff Survivors are seen at an Ethiopian-owned restaurant in the Kabalagala area of Kampala late on Sunday moments after twin bomb blasts tore through crowds of football fans watching the World Cup final. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW : Police: Device is found in a trashcan NEW : Police: Device is similar to those found at sites of blasts NEW: Al Qaeda congratulates Al-Shabaab Somali PM: "Civilized world" should unite to combat Al-Shabaab (CNN) -- Ugandan officials have recovered what they've alternately described as an explosives-laden belt or a vest in a trashcan at a nightclub in a suburb of Kampala, the chief of police said Tuesday. Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, the chief of police, said the device -- found Monday -- was impregnated with ball bearings and was similar to those found at two sites where blasts killed at least 74 people over the weekend. The device was found along with a detonator and what looked like a laptop bag, Kayihura said. When a journalist asked him whether this meant there was a third attack planned, he said, "It's possible there was."The police chief said that his office was working with international agencies -- but would not specify who. He also would not say how many people have been arrested in connection with the attack and what their nationalities were. Why is Uganda so important? Earlier, Fred Opolot, executive director of Uganda media center, said authorities had arrested several people but they have not yet been charged in connection with the attacks, Opolot said. "We are trying to find the culprits of this atrocity," he said. The blasts went off Sunday at two venues -- a restaurant and a rugby field -- where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup soccer finals. A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for a trio of bombings. "And the best of men have promised and they have delivered," said an Arabic statement issued by Al-Shabaab's press office and obtained by CNN. "Blessed and exalted among men -- (taking) full responsibility. ...We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response." The 6,000 is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. "We are behind the attack because we are at war with them," Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. "We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country. We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us," Rage said. Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali-Sharmarke called on the "civilized world to unite in stopping the mindless terror enterprise of Al-Shabab." "We will work with our partners in Uganda and the international community in bringing the cowards responsible for this heinous act," the prime minister said in a statement released Monday. Meanwhile, al Qaeda congratulated Al-Shabaab in a message posted on pro-jihad web forums. "Be pleased because all the sincere Muslims are with you joining you in your moments of pleasure and difficulty," read part of the message. The 74 fatalities included 28 Ugandans, one Irish citizen, one Indian, one American and 11 people who are either Ethiopian or Eritrean, according to the Ugandan government. The blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates. Two others exploded at the rugby center. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning Tuesday, according to a government statement. All flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said.

A group of U.S. lawmakers have called for an investigation into whether BP may have played a role in lobbying for the release of Abdel Basset al Megrahi to secure an oil contract with the Libyan government. BP may face probe over bomber's release - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } BP may face probe over bomber's release By Jesse Solomon , CNN Convicted Pan Am bomber Abdelbaset al Megrahi boards a plane in Scotland to make his final trip home to Libya on August 20. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Senator: BP stands to earn as much as $20 billion from the deal Senators want an investigation on whether BP lobbied to secure Libyan oil contract Al Megrahi serves eight years of life sentence before his release in August He was convicted for the 1988 Pan Am bombing that killed 270 people (CNN) -- A group of U.S. lawmakers have called for an investigation into whether BP may have played a role in lobbying for the release of Abdelbaset al Megrahi to secure an oil contract with the Libyan government. Megrahi, now 58, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. He was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds in August after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. "Reports have surfaced indicating that a 2007 oil agreement may have influenced the U.K. and Scottish governments' positions concerning Mr. Megrahi's release in 2009," wrote Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in a letter to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Monday. "The families of the victims of Pan Am flight 103 deserve to know whether justice took a back seat to commercial interests in this case," Lautenberg said. Mark Salt, a spokesman for BP in Houston, Texas, declined to discuss the Senators' probe. "We're not going to comment on speculation," he said. BP, which plans to begin offshore drilling in Libya in the coming months, touted the 2007 oil agreement as "the single biggest exploration financial commitment an international energy company has ever made to Libya," according to the company's website. The troubled oil giant stands to earn as much as $20 billion from the deal, according to Lautenberg. Megrahi, who only served eight years of his life sentence for the bombing, was released by a Scottish court on "compassionate" grounds, citing a doctor's opinion at the time that he was dying from prostate cancer and had only three months to live. In a letter to the British government last week, Lautenberg was joined by Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey in calling the validity of such a prognosis into question. "Mr. Al Megrahi is still alive and reportedly living in luxury," the letter said. "The doctor responsible for the key medical opinion has told the media that not only could Mr. Al Megrahi live another 10 years, but that the Libyan government had commissioned the doctor to make his assessment." In response, the British Embassy in Washington posted a letter on its website from the British ambassador to Gillibrand on defending Megrahi's release. "The decision to grant Mr. Megrahi's compassionate release was made on the basis of advice from the Director of Health at the Scottish Prison Service, who drew on the advice of a number of medical experts," the ambassador said. Brian Kelly, who lost his brother in the attack and fought vigorously to deny Megrahi's freedom, said he isn't surprised that Megrahi is still alive and believes BP was directly responsible for his release. "You can't allow the process of justice to be corrupted by the cynical mercantilism of one company," Kelly said.

A missing Iranian researcher, whom Tehran claimed was abducted by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. Missing Iranian researcher takes refuge in Pakistani embassy - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Missing Iranian researcher takes refuge in Pakistani embassy By the CNN Wire Staff Iran alleges the U.S. forces Amiri to disclose date about Iran's nuclear program. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Pakistan FM: Shahram Amiri is in the Iran's Interest Section of the embassy The section is staffed and controlled by Iran Iran claims he was kidnapped to force him to give up data about Iran's nuclear program U.S. has denied charge, but remained tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected (CNN) -- A missing Iranian researcher, whom Tehran claimed was abducted by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. "Iranian scientist Shahram Amiri, who was kidnapped by the Americans, had gone to the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. and taken refuge at Iran's Interest Section. He has requested to be sent back to Iran quickly," Iran's semiofficial news agency Mehr said Tuesday. Abdul Basit, a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry, told CNN that Amiri arrived at the Pakistani Embassy at 6:30 p.m. Monday. The Iran's Interest Section, Basit said, is controlled and staffed by Iran -- with about 70 to 80 Iranian diplomats. Because Iran and the United States do not maintain diplomatic ties, the Pakistani embassy looks after Iran's interest in Washington. It has no control over the Section, Basit said -- adding that Amiri was not a guest of, nor was he in the custody or protection of the Pakistani government. Amiri, a researcher at Tehran's Malek Ashtar University, mysteriously disappeared in June 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, according to Iranian media reports. Iran has accused the United States of involvement in Amiri's disappearance, saying the researcher was taken to force him to give up data about Tehran's nuclear program. The U.S. State Department has denied that charge, but has been tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected. As policy, the CIA does not comment on defections. But a U.S. official, who is not authorized to talk to the media about such issues, told CNN last month that it would be "ludicrous, absurd and even preposterous" to claim an individual was kidnapped by the United States and held against his will. On Sunday, Iranian media quoted a top Iranian lawmaker as saying that newly found documents back up Tehran's claims that the CIA is responsible. "The U.S. move to kidnap Amiri runs counter to international regulations," said Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. He said Iranian officials had turned over the documents to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran. Last month, two videos surfaced on the internet of a man claiming to be Amiri, in which he said he had escaped from U.S. agents and was hiding in Virginia. That was the third time that videos allegedly showing Amiri had been circulated on the internet. In one, he said he had been kidnapped by U.S. agents. Another contradicted that claim and said he was living freely and studying in Arizona. In one of the videos posted June 30 on YouTube and dated June 14, the man again said that he was brought against his will to the United States and fears he will be discovered and re-arrested. "I am Shahram Amiri, the son of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who with God's help succeeded in running away from the U.S. security agents in the state of Virginia. I am [temporarily] at a safe place and I am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that I may shortly be again arrested by American security agents." He went on to say: "I am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people. If I face any problems or if I do not return to my country soon, the government of the U.S. would be directly responsible for it." CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos, nor the identity of the man in them. "If he is who people think he is, the U.S. would be in contact with the person," a CIA official said last month And if he were being held against his will, "how would he have been able to produce any of the videos?" the official said. In the second video that surfaced June 30 and dated June 23, the man claiming to be Amiri reassures his family about his well-being. "I want to let my beloved family know that I am OK and they should not worry about my health," he says. "With God's help I shall return to my beloved country in the next few days. I want them to be, as always, strong and patient and to pray for my safe return. I hope to see you in our beloved country." Tehran blamed Washington for Amiri's disappearance shortly after revelations surfaced that Iran has been building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom. After that, tensions over Iran's nuclear program mounted. Iran says its nuclear energy is solely for civilian purposes. But the United States pushed the United Nations to punish Tehran for its nuclear ambitions. The Security Council recently slapped a fourth round of tough sanctions on the Islamic republic. It's unclear how much information Amiri was privy to in Iran. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.

NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James By the CNN Wire Staff Comments about LeBron James drew a $100,000 fine for Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NBA fines Cavs owner $100,000 for comments Gilbert's letter described James' departure as a "cowardly betrayal" Commissioner says Gilbert's words were "ill-advised and imprudent" Stern also criticizes James' handling of his decision to leave (CNN) -- The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert's words, "though understandable, were ill-advised and imprudent." In a letter posted on the team's website Thursday, Gilbert called James' decision to play for the Miami Heat a "cowardly betrayal" and a "shocking act of disloyalty." James, who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career, announced his decision to leave the team during a much-ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled "The Decision." In a press conference which was posted on the NBA's website Monday, Stern said that James was "certainly entitled" to leave the team, but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently. "I think that the advice that he received on this was poor. But his performance was fine. His honesty and his integrity I think shine through, but this decision was ill-conceived, badly produced and poorly executed," Stern said. Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert's letter showed a "property-owner's mentality." "Equally imprudent I believe are the remarks by my good friend Jesse Jackson, which purport to make this into a racial matter... he really is mistaken," Stern said. Before deciding to join the Miami Heat, James, a reigning two-time NBA MVP, looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland. He said it came down to one thing. "The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future." James said. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opens hearings into the safety of the diabetes drug Avandia on Tuesday after a scathing report that suggested the drug may be more dangerous than previously reported. FDA hearings set for diabetes drug Avandia - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } FDA hearings set for diabetes drug Avandia By the CNN Wire Staff FDA scrutinizes safety of diabetes drug STORY HIGHLIGHTS FDA panel could vote to remove the drug from the market Study concludes Avandia raises heart attack risk FDA criticizes drug company study that claimed otherwise Drug is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opens hearings into the safety of the diabetes drug Avandia on Tuesday after a scathing report that suggested the drug may be more dangerous than previously reported. An FDA advisory panel will hear two days of testimony about the drug, and could vote on whether to remove the drug from the market. Its manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, says several trials have shown the drug is safe -- but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study concluded that Avandia raised the risk of heart attacks and other heart problems. Avandia is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics. A strongly worded FDA report, released Friday, sharply criticized a Glaxo study released that painted a more reassuring picture of the drug. That study, known as RECORD, found no increased risk of heart problems. But the FDA found Glaxo researchers repeatedly submitted sloppy data and failed to follow up on reports of problems in patients -- including reports of patient deaths. Dr. Thomas Marciniak, the author of the FDA analysis, called the study's design "inappropriate and biased." "I've been following the FDA for 20 years," said Dr. Steven Nissen, whose 2007 study found Avandia users had a 43 percent higher risk of heart attacks than patients who used other drugs. "I've never seen an FDA review as blistering as his review of the record trial." Nissen is scheduled to deliver a presentation to the FDA on Monday. The agency's advisory board voted in 2007 to keep Avandia on the market, in part because of Glaxo's RECORD study. Dr. Murray Stewart, the company's vice president for clinical development, said last week that six clinical studies -- not just the one criticized by the FDA -- "show that this medicine does not increase the overall risk of heart attack, stroke or death." "There's just no evidence of an increase in heart attacks," he said. "What's more, all the clinical trials show no evidence in mortality versus standard of care. They all show decreased mortality." CNN's Caleb Hellerman and Dr. Sanjay Gupta contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS Officers responding to 911 call find 10 people shot Three were dead -- one of them believed to be the shooter Albuquerque police believe it was a domestic violence situation that spilled into workplace One of victims believed to be wife or girlfriend of shooter, police say (CNN) -- New Mexico authorities said a former employee shot and killed two people at a business Monday in Albuquerque before turning the gun on himself. Police said officers responded to a 911 call at 9:26 a.m. (11:26 a.m. ET) that multiple shots had been fired. When officers entered the building, they found a total of 10 people shot -- three were dead, including a man believed to be the shooter, officials said. Police said after the incident that six people had died in the shooting, then Monday afternoon revised the toll to three dead. Police said there had been miscommunication among officers and emergency personnel in the first counting. "We believe this incident to be a domestic-violence workplace situation," Albuquerque Police Chief Ray Schultz said. "One of the victims -- a current employee at Emcore Corp -- is believed to be the wife or girlfriend of the shooter," Schultz said. Police officials have since corrected earlier reports identifying the shooter as a female. Police also said that they have located the children of the offender and one of his victims. Schultz would only say that the children are "OK." "We've got the neighborhood secured," Schultz said. Because of the large size of the Emcore facility, authorities were sweeping the area a second time. "We're looking under every desk, every closet, any place anyone could be concealed," Schultz told reporters. Police are continuing the investigation at a community center near Emcore Company facility where some 85 employees who were inside the building at the time of the shooting are being interviewed before being released. A website for the Emcore Corporation describes its business as fiber optics and solar power technology. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.

Crew members tell investigators they called The Caribbean Sea, which was towing a barge that collided with the tour boat, but got no answer. Two people died. Tour boat calls before crash went unanswered - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Tour boat calls before crash went unanswered By the CNN Wire Staff Since the crash, the tour boat has been lifted from the river, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said Friday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Crew of tour boat said it made radio calls before collision The Caribbean Sea was towing barge that hit tour boat Tour boat was anchored after mechanical problems Two people died in last week's collision in Delaware River (CNN) -- The crew of a tour boat that sank in a collision in the Delaware River last week made radio calls to a vessel involved in the crash, but those calls went unanswered, federal investigators said Monday. The tour boat crew told investigators that they made radio calls to the vessel Caribbean Sea that were not answered, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The Caribbean Sea was towing a barge that collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water, the report said. Two people died. One of five crew members of the Caribbean Sea, meanwhile, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to meet with investigators, the safety board said. Video: Ill fated duck boat lifted from water "We remain confident the NTSB will shed light on all of the facts surrounding this accident. Our mutual goal is to ensure nothing like this ever happens again," said Chris Herschend, president of Ride The Ducks. Since RTD Philadelphia began in 2003, there has never been a serious accident and only a handful of mechanical breakdowns, company officials said. The tour boat, the DUKW 34, carried 35 passengers and two crew members when it experienced mechanical problems about five to 10 minutes before the crash, the NTSB report said. That problem led the ship's master to anchor the tour boat. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Sea approached, towing a barge. Around 2:36 p.m., the bow of the barge hit the small tour boat, causing it to sink, investigators said. People who operated several vessels in the area have told federal investigators that they heard the tour boat's radio calls. The National Traffic Safety Board said it's looking into those accounts. The agency noted that some -- but not all -- such radio calls are recorded. Two people died as a result of the collision -- Szabolcs Prem, 20, and Dora Schwendtner, 16. Both were from Hungary.

Enter your address to receive news by email. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Born and raised on the Texas Gulf Coast, Ive spent the past few months trying to wrap my head around the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent massive oil spill that is now ruining the coastline from Louisiana to Florida. At times, I have to turn off the news, as the images of dying wildlife hit me deep in my gut. But now more than ever, this national tragedy has made me grateful for the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. While the oil continues to spew, the media WordPress.com bloggers included have been on the frontlines, making sure that Americans and everyone the world over know what is really happening in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill has also made me realize how fragile this freedom is as the Associated Press reported , journalists covering the Gulf of Mexico oil spill have been yelled at, kicked off public beaches and islands and threatened with arrest Which is why Im happy to announce that WordPress.com is a proud supporter of the 1 for All campaign that launches today with the simple goal of raising awareness about the First Amendment.

So proud of WordPress for doing this. Our First Amendment rights are crucial, and it warms me to see people standing up and speaking out for whats fair. Makes me proud to be a WordPress blogger. It is a great campaign, Joy, and I hope all WordPress.com bloggers will continue to step forward from the depths and help fill in all the missing niches with the truth that is purposefully repressed to serve the majority powers vested interests. I have already written a short article on my blog. Though I am not an American, I am concerned as a citizen of the world. I guess WordPress is at the right place doing the right thing, which will have its impact. Cheers everyone out there!! That is AWESOME news! Nothing is more important than Free Speech!!! Awesome. I wish we had something similar for Canada. The recent G20 summit and the police reaction is parallel, and so is the response of bloggers keeping people informed. This is awesome, good for you WordPress. And congrats on hosting it! Looking forward to uploading some freedom pics. Lets also support the basic human right of self defense by supportingto the same unquestioned degreethe second amendment which unequivocally affirms the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. (What part of shall not be infringed do you not understand?) Great! I was just going to bloggingly join the Russian movement 31, the name of which is rooted in the number of Russian constitution article (31) about the freedom to assemble peacefully. This article is said to be notoriously denied by the government and is exercised at the governments will. The movement is about making the government follow the Constitution. So, why not make it a start, even though there are only 30 days in June July the 1st is just as good. Well done WordPress!!! All of these oil wells are ticking time bombs and the sooner we get off fossil fuels the better off we will all be. The balance of power will be taken away from the middle east and the world will become a better place. Disasters like this is what it will take to make people start to demand an alternativeit will happenbut it will take time. Worry about the federal government. This government, congress and the president is the greatest threat to our freedom in our history. There is a bill working its way through the senate giving the president the power to shut the internet down for up to 4 months. Obama during the health care debate asked for people to report those who are speaking out against the health care initiative to the government http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Facts-Are-Stubborn-Things/ Yes the oil spill is a disaster for the United States. Because of not only the First Amendment, but our entire Constitution, we are one of the greatest countries in the world. We are not without our faults. The oil spill was a wake up call. This Nation will solve the problem, learn from it, and continue to be a great nation. Proud to be a veteran and a citizen of the United States of America! COOL! Im inand tagging all my prior and future BP blogs with the appropriate 1st Amendment. This past Memorial Day was my personal anniversary for speaking out, and supporting the right of people to speak out, demonstrate their feelings and opinions in a just and legal manner. The 50th anniversary of my first arrest on behalf of civil rights for all Americans. My crime? Sitting down for a Coke at a drugstore counter with friends who happened to be Black Americans. Less than 50 miles from Congress and the White House btw. Last week I posted a blog entry about the BP oil spill. It appears that BP executives chose to cut costs in the interests of higher profits which of course always translates to higher income for executives. This mind set is endemic in corporate culture, nothing new. We can ignore little things like defective cars, etc. But consider the Columbia space shuttle disaster in May 1986 with a loss of 7 lives and a terrible set back for the space program. The cause: a defective O Ring discovered by a NASA engineera whistle blower. The lift-off must proceed on schedule so his warning was ignored. Years later we had the Challenger explosion. Now we have the BP oil spill. Once again the warnings of engineers were ignored in the pursuit of higher profits. Instead of a loss of 7 lives and setbacks for the space program, BP is in charge of destroying an entire eco system, ending a culture that has existed for generations, and put thousandsprobably millions of US citizens out of work. And the CEO wanted his life back so he could go to the yacht races. Tell that to the widow of the man who recently killed himself because he felt his life as he had known it was over. We need our First Amendment rights to continue because as writers all we have is our keyboards to fight withthe most important tool. Whilst I appreciate what you are saying and I am also gutted about the oil spill, I find myself asking but what about Mississippi and the effect of Hurricane Katrina. From an English perspective the state is still feeling the effects of the hurricane with very little effort to rebuild the place. We have a programme called Top Gear and they went through the state and were appalled at how badly it had been hit but how bad it still was. It seems a huge effort is being undertaken to cope with the effect of the oil spill, is that because Americas beautiful coast is being effected? Is it because there is more money in Florida than Mississippi? Or maybe this is what you are saying? Anyway thanks for the challenging read. As an additional comment, it is interesting that in the news section of the 1 for All page is a link to a story by the apparently misnamed First Amendment Center lauding the fact that the FCC has denied the First Amendment rights of a radical politician (KKK recruiter Robert Byrd would love this guy). The FCC requires broadcast stations to give qualified federal candidates access to airtime. The FCC does not require a station *give* candidates airtime for free, only that they are required to give them *access* to airtime and that stations may not edit or censor the ads. The FCC has now declared itself judge, jury and executioner by declaring this political hopeful is not a bona fide candidate and therefore the FCC enforcement and protection of the First Amendment as it applies to radio doesnt apply to *this* candidate. So much for trusting government to protect the Constitution and the rights of the people. Ill save most of my comments for the contest. However, living in Europe now, watching civil liberties disappear on a daily basis and seeing stringent limitations on recourse, and the silencing of legit complaint or discourse, makes me deeply appreciative of this opportunity to warn all free citizens that the cold steel shaft of the EUSSR is imminent, and that the USA is currently experiencing open and covert encroachments on its freedom. As for the Gulf, well, Ive only one year of Third Level Honours Physics, but using existing technology with a tweak here and there I could harvest that oil within a week or two. I have no doubt that if the will was there, that spill would be cleaned up weeks ago. Simply put, it IS all about freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Thank God for that! Often I just dont understand. You can walk into a convenience store and see pornography magazines in huge stands. Thats freedom. You can even worship Satan if you so choose when you are in prison and the taxpayers pay for it. Freedom of religion. Now reporters are threatened when trying to cover one of the largest oil spill disasters within our time? They are threatened because they are trying to get word to the people? Somehow it all just doesnt add up, does it? go figure! Thats good to hear. I also dont watch the news for the same reason, its too sad for me. Great initiative! It is important that we continually safeguard the freedoms that we enjoy. Will do, folks. Ill get my creative juices going this afternoon and come up with a post and tag it human rights (among other related things). Ive written on this very thing many times, as it is one of my favorite topics. Thanks for your focus. One of my favorite quotes: The only valid censorship of ideas is the right of people not to listen. (Tommy Smothers) Thanks! Even though Im not American, the First Amendment is very important! Nice job WordPress. With you all the way. America is a very greedy country (and I live here too). Extremely greedy. Extremely, extremely greedy. That is the first truth we need to deal with. America was created on the greedy killing of Indians, then a complete denial of such a thing. I am not sure if (our own countrys) greed is what really caused this oil spill, but I have a sneaking suspicion my fathers take on Independence Day these days http://kl1hbalaska.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/120/ We must continually be on the watch for those who want to erode the truths found in the deceleration on independence, the constitution and the bill of rights. These people who want to change our very way of life are not always living in a foreign country. As a freelance environmental journalist based in Canada I am thrilled to see this renewed interest in the vital role media plays in any democracy. I have been assisting my US colleagues with my contacts in covering the Gulf Oil spill. But all of us have huge problems getting our stories published as mainstream media is in major decline. Some 31,000 journalists and editors lost their jobs in the past 2 years in the US. Sure there are many good news sites on the web but who is going to pay reporters to do this important work? Who bails us out if we get arrested for taking pictures of oily turtles? What happens when we get sick? An independent and free Press needs support from the Public. I have started a Community Supported Environmental Journalism fund and helped other freelance jurnos do the same. I hope the wordpress community will use their words and their dollars to support the First Amendment otherwise it becomes a glorious sentiment on a piece of paper. Its inspiring to see WordPress standing for something so fundamental as freedom of speech. Im glad to see your post. We dont have a written constitution in my country, Britain, and although we have a (recent) freedom of information act it is not the same as your countrys constitutional rights in that regard. Over here, information can be and is still deleted, blacked out, on things that some one in a government post Secretary of State or Under Secretary decides threatens the national security if revealed. Thats fine in principle, but the fact is that folk are becoming ever more cynical about the judgement calls being used and since the Iraq War of 2003 there is a growing discontent over what we (the citizens) were told at that time (the reason for invading) and what we have leaned since, through private and public disclosures (the latter happening because of public opinion pressure). What ever the side of any argument we are on, and what ever our political persuasion, left, right center and all combinations in between, we all need, must have, the sort of basic human rights and freedoms that are declared and enshrined in your (US) Constitution, whose aspirations were written down and declared at a time of conflict, and we should all, wherever we are, if it is humanly possible, do whatever is within our reasonable and legal power though if we have not the legal power then our democracy is faulty to protect and safeguard such rights and freedoms. I wish we, over here, had such freedoms so indelibly spelt out in a written constitution, but this does not stop me, a foreigner, applauding your objective and cheering you on. Bravo! Keep it rolling! I have a link on my blog. Well done. It just so happens that today, we added a section to our blog called, Say What you Need to Say! Is it fate that both happened on the same day? Maybe were all just feeling the need to reassert our right to free speech. The American War of Independence once inspired the French Revolution. These events later inspired the Indian (India, as in South Asia) freedom fighters to raise their voice against the colonizers. I am with everyone who supports the freedom of expression in any country of the world PEACE! The 1st amendment and freedom of the press are the backbone of our civil liberties. As the child of parents who fled the Cuban communist dictatorship which still imprisons journalists to this day, I applaud WordPress for speaking out. Keep it up! congrats WP!!! i really just wanna know what theme they are using awesome site!!! I suspect that supporting and writing on forums like wordpress.com are ten times more powerful than placing a single vote, especially today, when corporations own most of our politicians. Well done WordPress and all the writers here for speaking out, for holding onto the lifeblood of our nation that throbbing red serum of truth that freedom to speak. Please, all of you check out the program below. You need to see it. All Americans, all parents, children, politicians, all people need to see this: Does your tap water ignite? Gasland is an urgent, cautionary and sometimes darkly comic look at the largest domestic natural gas drilling campaign in history. Part of the HBO Documentary Films Series. WATCH: Gasland: Trailer http://www.hbo.com Thank goodness for your site, WordPress. Thank you for being here. I have to agree with Rich. A terrible thing is happening with the oil disaster but other disasters have taken place not of an oil companys making, and involving considerable loss of life and homes. But, from news we get over here, little shouting is being done to restore normality after the Katrina hurricane disaster five years ago. Much still needs to be done after 1,836 people killed, 400,000 jobs lost. 270,000 homes gone. Of course, people have a right to demonstrate their anger and frustration. I find it rather curious though that no sorrow appears to be expressed for the 11 deaths and severe injuries of the workers. Is there no compassion for their relatives? Drilling in such deep water is fraught with problems. I am surprised that ladybard, with no experience whatsoever of such matters, can be certain (arrogantly so?) that she could fix it! Would she don a diving suit and drop a mile down with a bathtub plug? Only mechanical deep sea devices can be used. New disasters need innovative solutions. All the yelling in the world will not plug an oil leak of this nature. The safety devices (three?) (note: US manufactured) failed. The cement failed (USA company). It cannot be known why failure occurred until the leak is plugged and investigations can take place. Do you really think that BP would deliberately take more time than needed to end this dreadful tragedy? US pensioners (almost as many as British) will be losing a great deal of money too. You talk as though BP is out to destroy itself. We have seen oil disasters on our coast (remember the full oil tanker broken up on coastal rocks?) and could weep at the loss and suffering of wild life. Not exactly good for holiday businesses and fishing either. But then, in the past, we have had ports almost bombed out of existence. Nature does heal itself and businesses can be restored. Of course it takes time. Perhaps it is a good time to reflect that the USA uses more oil per capita than any other country in the world. Poor people of third world countries suffer from having their environment polluted. Who stands up for their rights? I certainly sympathise with those suffering from this disaster, but please let reason prevail. And remember those who work on oil rigs and risk their lives daily for you to drive your cars and fly the globe. You have a right of free speech. Long may that continue. But temper anger with reason and mercy. Thank you for supporting the First Amendment, of which the separation of Church and State is of utmost importance to me personally. Hopefully the oil spill will be a wake-up call to consider how destructive humans can be when we are negligible. Heres to alternative energy sources! It is not just about the Gulf issues. It is also about the kill switch that is now before the Senate. This, if it is passed, will definitely affect the First Amendment. I cannot imagine a world without communication..even for national security. There are not deadlines on this power. Here is to WordPress and to all those who will blog, photo, vid..anything in the name of the First Amendment and yesfreedom. Great idea! I think this is a very good cause. And I agree with fabstash, America is very greedy. It will be just wonderful when the time comes that we will look BACK at laws like these and wonder why they were put on the books in the first place? Meaning, the ways in which society behaves is such that a law like this no longer needs to be law as it is something that is just NORMALLY followed by everyone. Im really glad to see this development, the eroding freedom of speech in this great Land of the Free has concerned me tremendously, of late. I, too, am horrified by the suffering and destruction of the environment and precious wildlife by the BP Gulf oil debacle, and am equally curious as to why the media would be chastised and driven away from reporting on this so-called accident that is literally destroying an entire ocean, one day at a time. What is there to hide, since the obvious problem the oil is washing ashore? Perhaps something else is afoot . . . Glad to see WordPress fighting back. I am writing from New Zealand. Always listen to Alex Jones on : http://prisonplanet.tv/ Hes been warning public about this for years especially American public, but hes been considered off the wall. Glad to see Americans are waking up. We need to hear in New Zealand too. I feel for USA citizens though because you are brought up with hand on heart believing in the American Way. So there has been a blind trust in your leaders intentions. Go WordPress, because you are not fighting for your freedoms only but ours too, its all trickling in here too. Very cool. I have been writing about the Gulf Coast BP disaster since it happened and great to know WP is exactly what i thought it was very engaged in what is going on all over the world and issues that effect human beings as a whole less lip service then other blog services whoo ya Epic win for WordPress! We have a voice and it needs to be heard. People cannot silence the truth because it always comes back to the surface no matter how hard you try to bury it. Thats a wonderful way to participate Life is not just an option, its a right! Thanks you, WordPress, for your noble actions and your continued efforts in developing and maintaining Humanity as a significant and well-existent concept.. Fantastic idea. The first Amendment is the greatest law we have, in my opinion. But people should also realize the invaluable work real journalists do, especially as newspapers are going out of business, and I hope people dont continue to mistake the work of ordinary citizens and aggregator news sites with the real reports filed by journalists showing us as best they can whats going on in the world. Sunday is July 4th. We have much to be thankful for. I am thankful for freedom to be where I am and do what I am doing. I love to write, and some is from a religious background. I am thankful that I can put it out there for those who will read it, and its the peoples choice as to whether they will read it or not. I love WordPress and the liberty of writing on my blogs.This is becoming a bigger part of my day,and I havent ever written so much as now. So I applaud freedom of speech, freedom of writing, and give thanks to God for preserving our country as long as He has. I hope we have many more years of freedom. Happy 4th to you. Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter oneâs thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. As a non-American I think I probably do support the idea of this 1 for All thing, but what a shame that you had to also use this announcement to encourage people to speak out even more about human rights issues. I dont mean to imply that human rights issues arent important, they certainly are. But I read so much xenophobic crap on the internet when people are discussing human rights, and so many distortions of the truth based on what the US media has reported, (oh well, if they reported it then it must be true), and the vast majority of that crap comes from writers in the US. I just wish more people would realise that the whole world does not judge itself by the so called values of one particular nation, nor should it. A terrific endeavor. And dont forget the lessons in the First Amendment that high school journalists learn through excellent organizations such as the Student Press Law Center and the Journalism Education Association. Thank you for your commentary, and the commitment of WordPress to join 1 for All. Documenting and reporting the events in the Gulf has been and continues to be essential, as is a free press. Moreover, the power of traditional and new media to coalesce has immense potential for good. Thanks for the 1 for All link. Much appreciated. Does anyone know if its possible to get on the Friends of 1 For All list? Is it possible the people who yelled at the reporters are not government workers? Because if they are not, it is perfectly legal for them to say GTFO. But if thy are, good for you wordpress! The First Ammendment is very important. Back in the eighties, I was an Anti Contra Aid Protestor and I went on two rallies. The first was no problem except the cops made their intimidating presence felt. The second was when Regan visited a local high school and we were immediately demonised by the pro Regan crowd. I heard a lot of people tell me where I could stick my first ammendment. So, I know how important it is to fight for it. I am from Slovakia, small country in the middle Europe, and I appreciate this activity very much also because of our communist past. The catastropy in the Mexican Gulf is the matter of whole world. At my blog Im writing about it and Im happy to have the possibility to write about the things which concern me and my friends and honest people all around the world.

Pingback: Support the First Amendment with 1 for All (via WordPress.com News) | kenneth michael shultz When the voice of the people are silenced, the rights of the people are gone. All our rights hang on our freedom to speak truth. When the First Amendment is removed all the ammendments proceeding are vanquished. No arms to bear and no right to vote. We will have no other choice other than the right to remain silent! The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriotsThomas Jefferson As someone who lives in another country, I fully support the first amendment in principle. As long as the reporting is about something that is in the public interest it is great. The one thing I find rather unfortunate, however, is that the journalist decides how much invasion of privacy is ok in pursuit of a story, regardless of whether one wants to have ones private life spread out before the world to see. So, while it is in the public interest when it comes to stories like the oil spill, I do like the privacy rights granted to people in France for example. Unless something is in the public interest, you can be sued as a journalist for putting stuff out there that is no ones business but ones own. And ususally, in cases like this, the publication and the journalist loose. So if someone wants to jump around naked in their own house without the whole world knowing about it, one is better off living anywhere but the US. Ill be fighting for my fight to party! I very much approve of this! These days it seems that our first amendment rights have come under attack (by things like the patriot act) so Im very glad to see that something is actually being done to keep those rights safe.

( Court Filing PDF ) The heart of the class action suit, which was originally filed in October 2007, is whether consumers who entered the two-year contract with AT&amp;T did so knowing that they were actually entering a de-facto five-year contract because thats what the AT&amp;T-Apple exclusivity agreement has been reported to be. Apple has never publicly stated how long its exclusivity contract with AT&amp;T is, though a five year time periodfirst reported by USA Today back in 2007was recently confirmed through court documents related to this case.

BP robots have attached a new tighter-fitting cap on top of the gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well. BP is testing the new cap to see if it can withstand the pressure before launching the next phase which should stop the leak! Let us all hope this works. BP has been polluting the waters in the Gulf of Mexico now for nearly three months. BP is hiding a lot of facts and the world really has not seen what is really going on down in the Gulf. On June 24th, Charter Boat Captain William Allen Kruse shot himself just two weeks after being hired to skim oil for BP. Sadly BP took away the 55-year-old mans lively hood and then his life. It is truly a nightmare and I wish all of the Gulf Coast the best.

( Court Filing PDF ) The heart of the class action suit, which was originally filed in October 2007, is whether consumers who entered the two-year contract with AT&amp;T did so knowing that they were actually entering a de-facto five-year contract because thats what the AT&amp;T-Apple exclusivity agreement has been reported to be. Apple has never publicly stated how long its exclusivity contract with AT&amp;T is, though a five year time periodfirst reported by USA Today back in 2007was recently confirmed through court documents related to this case.

BP robots have attached a new tighter-fitting cap on top of the gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well. BP is testing the new cap to see if it can withstand the pressure before launching the next phase which should stop the leak! Let us all hope this works. BP has been polluting the waters in the Gulf of Mexico now for nearly three months. BP is hiding a lot of facts and the world really has not seen what is really going on down in the Gulf. On June 24th, Charter Boat Captain William Allen Kruse shot himself just two weeks after being hired to skim oil for BP. Sadly BP took away the 55-year-old mans lively hood and then his life. It is truly a nightmare and I wish all of the Gulf Coast the best.

Illinois Sen. Roland Burris has been out of the limelight for a while, which probably is OK with him, as much of the attention after his senatorial appointment by former Gov. Rod Blagojevich wasn't all that favorable. But Environment Illinois volunteers and staff members didn't want him off the radar completely, which is one reason why they were standing out in the rain and waving placards Tuesday morning at a South Loop BP gasoline station. Environment Illinois, along with some other green groups around the nation, is worried about a pending amendment introduced by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) that would block new rules requiring cars and light trucks to use less oil. The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on the amendment, which would reject the EPA's ruling that greenhouse gases are hazardous to the public. That ruling is the basis for the EPA's authority to control the gases. Mixing rain and oil: Green group's Loop protest vs. amendment - BackTalk A dialog between Sun-Times opinion writers and our readers Mixing rain and oil: Green group's Loop protest vs. amendment By Thomas Frisbie on June 8, 2010 12:16 PM Illinois Sen. Roland Burris has been out of the limelight for a while, which probably is OK with him, as much of the attention after his senatorial appointment by former Gov. Rod Blagojevich wasn't all that favorable. But Environment Illinois volunteers and staff members didn't want him off the radar completely, which is one reason why they were standing out in the rain and waving placards Tuesday morning at a South Loop BP gasoline station. Environment Illinois, along with some other green groups around the nation, is worried about a pending amendment introduced by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) that would block new rules requiring cars and light trucks to use less oil. The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on the amendment, which would reject the EPA's ruling that greenhouse gases are hazardous to the public. That ruling is the basis for the EPA's authority to control the gases. Max Muller, program director of Environment Illinois , said he expects the vote to be close. A new analysis released by the group indicates the amendment would increase Illinois' dependence on oil by more than 17 million gallons in 2016. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin is solidly opposed to the amendment. But Environment Illinois worried that although Burris' staff had indicated he'd vote against it, the senator hadn't publicly stated his opposition. That changed Tuesday afternoon, when Burris spokesman Jim O'Connor said Burris is "solidly against" the amendment and will vote against it. Presumably, Environment Illinois will think it was worth standing in the rain to hear that.

( Court Filing PDF ) The heart of the class action suit, which was originally filed in October 2007, is whether consumers who entered the two-year contract with AT&amp;T did so knowing that they were actually entering a de-facto five-year contract because thats what the AT&amp;T-Apple exclusivity agreement has been reported to be. Apple has never publicly stated how long its exclusivity contract with AT&amp;T is, though a five year time periodfirst reported by USA Today back in 2007was recently confirmed through court documents related to this case. This story was originally published, under the headline Lawsuit against Apple, AT&amp;T exclusivity wins class action status at ZDNets Between the Lines.

BP is testing the new cap to see if it can withstand the pressure before launching the next phase which should stop the leak! Let us all hope this works. BP has been polluting the waters in the Gulf of Mexico now for nearly three months. BP is hiding a lot of facts and the world really has not seen what is really going on down in the Gulf. On June 24th, Charter Boat Captain William Allen Kruse shot himself just two weeks after being hired to skim oil for BP. Sadly BP took away the 55-year-old mans lively hood and then his life. It is truly a nightmare and I wish all of the Gulf Coast the best.

What matters tomorrow, tonight. ... Read it and sleep. United States - White House - Barack Obama - Kathleen Sebelius - NASA The 14 3/4 Biggest Ideas of the Year - Marc Ambinder is the politics editor of The Atlantic . He has covered Washington for ABC News and the Hotline, and he is chief political consultant to CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @marcambinder Marc Ambinder is the politics editor for The Atlantic , where he curates the influential Politics channel on TheAtlantic.com and contributes to the magazine. He is also a contributing editor to National Journal and chief political consultant to CBS News.  At the Hotline, Ambinder was the founding editor of "Hotline On Call," a pathbreaking political news blog. He also worked as a producer and reporter for the ABC News Political Unit and was one of the founders of ABC's "The Note," In 2009, he was part of the team was awarded the Columbia University School of Journalism's Dupont Silver Baton for Katie Couric's interview with Sarah Palin.  At ABC News, his work included Emmy-nominated research for "This Week." The Politics site has been nominated for a Webby and has won several national awards, including the Golden Dot from George Washington University's Democracy Online project.  He covers politics, policy, national security and science. Born in New York City, raised in Central Florida, he's a 2001 graduate of Harvard and lives in Washington, D.C. From the Night Beat: Within hours, a new capping stack should be snug on top of the Deepwater Horizon well. And if you look at the live stream , it appears as if there is no oil leaking into the Gulf. Really.  MYTHS DEBUNKED AND BUNKED : No, gays will not be segregated if they are accepted (openly) into the military. "Absurd," spokesman Geoff Morrell tells CBS News. At most, perhaps a shower curtain could be added to open showers in response to a survey question about shower situations. ... No, the decision not to pursue the Black Panther case from election day was not made by political appointees. The political appointees who would have made the decision had not been confirmed yet, reports Adam Serwer. ...  And no, priority three of Charles Boldin, the administrator of NASA, is not outreach to the Muslim world. Or so says the White House, which insists that Boldin misspoke . Actually, the White House is probably wrong on this one and Boldin probably knows what the President told him. ... Liberal media alert: Mort Zuckerman (who is no liberal) says he "helped write one of [Obama's] speeches" but won't say which one. Obama's aides don't remember consulting with Zuckerman.  COOPERATION : Wonder why Russia is agreeing with U.S. intelligence assessments that Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon? The CIA and the SVR, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, have been working together on a joint assessment, sharing analysis to a degree that would have been unimaginable during the Cold War. (This is one reason why CIA Director Leon Panetta has a good relationship with his SVR counterpart and consults with him often.) A revised, classified National Intelligence Estimate of Iran's capabilities is due any day now. SNOWE VOTE : Sen. Olympia Snowe will vote "yes" on the financial regulatory reform bill, leaving Senate Democrats one vote shy of the 60 needed to break a threatened filibuster. Sen. Ben Nelson remains on the fence. Congressional Democrats are confident the bill will pass. ... For close followers of the legislation -- those on the left, broadly -- it's important that Elizabeth Warren, the law professor whose consumer crusading has kept the bill on track and who strongly advocated for the creation of a separate agency to regulate consumer financial products, becomes the head of that agency if she wants the job. Suffice it to say, it is not clear whether Warren does want the job -- it is one that will require management skills, not so much a public face -- but it will be hers for the taking.  LEADERS MEET : President Obama meets tomorrow with Senate Democratic leaders ... and various other Senate Democrats, which means that, as much as they might all want to agree on a schedule of events leading up to the August recess, with that big of a group, not much will get done. ... The Senate confirmed President Obama's 23rd judicial nomination today; President Bush at this point had 72 of his judges confirmed. SLUGGISH PACE : Last May, the White House outlined the Department of Homeland Security's role in protecting critical infrastructure. Late last week , the White House issued the following guidance: Effective immediately, DHS will exercise primary responsibility within the executive branch for the operational aspects of Federal agency cybersecurity with respect to the Federal information systems that fall within FISMA under 44 U.S.C. ÃÂ§3543. Which is sort of what one assumes that DHS is supposed to have been doing all along. ... Wednesday's cyber security meeting at the White House will touch on the economic consequences of cyber crime (and the benefits of cooperation on it) and will serve as a check-in of sorts, or an attempt by the White House to convey to industry, particularly the IT side of industry, that it will take cyber breaches seriously. It's not a public event, and the White House won't say much about it. SUPER WOMAN : First Lady Michelle Obama is fast becoming the avatar of health promotion; she has three preventative-health-related events in the space of two days. Tomorrow, she launches the new Letsmove.gov website with a live chat on AOL at 10:00 am EST. On Wednesday, she hosts another South Lawn Series event featuring United States Tennis Assocation stars and Billie Jean King (it's tennis themed). And later that day, she joins Jill Biden and Kathleen Sebelius and docs at GWU for a preventative health care initiative announcement. BUSINESS BEAT : From the Atlantic Business Channel's Daniel Indiviglio : In the morning we get trade deficit numbers for May. In April we saw a $1 billion decline in U.S. exports -- the biggest drop in more than a year -- and an increase in the trade deficit. If that trend continues, it will deaden the possibility of an export-driven recovery. A few notable corporate earnings releases will include Yum! Brands Inc. and Intel Corp.

Strangely, it's a break for the Obama administration Minerals Management Service - Ken Salazar - Obama administration - United States Department of the Interior - United States Secretary of the Interior No Charges Expected for Former Interior Secretary - Politics - The Atlantic The 14 3/4 Biggest Ideas of the Year - Chris Good is a staff editor at TheAtlantic.com, where he writes for the magazine&amp;#8217;s Politics Channel. He has previously reported and blogged for The Hill newspaper. So reports Peter Stone at the Center for Public Integrity: the Department of Justice is winding down its investigation of whether former Interior Secretary Gale Norton gave preferential treatment to Shell in awarding three oil-drilling leases to one of its subsidiaries about a year before taking a job as Shell's general counsel; sources tell Stone no charges are expected to be filed. Strangely, this is probably a break for the Obama administration, even though Norton was a Bush appointee and left the department in 2006. Since BP's oil spill, the culture of the Interior Department and, more specifically, the Minerals Management Service, has drawn public concern, thanks largely to the timely release of an inspector general's report on Bush-era corruption and abuses, including not just improper gift exchanges with industry types, but the viewing of porn at work.  It's fair to say that public dismay over the Interior Department was a bad thing for President Obama and his administration, as he struggled to convey a sense of government competence and fought off partisan criticisms that his executive branch had lackadaisically responded to the spill. All of the abuses in the IG report occurred when President Bush occupied the White House, but a sense of failed government, I think, posed an issue for the people running it now. The new head of that department, Elizabeth Birnbaum, resigned in May despite not having anything to do with what was in the report, and Obama, for his part, felt the need to defend his Interior Secretary, Ken Salazar, after the culture of corruption at Interior became a hot topic. "When Secretary Salazar took office, he found a Minerals and Management Service that had been plagued by corruption for years -- this was the agency charged with not only providing permits, but also enforcing laws governing oil drilling," Obama said at his first full-fledged press conference after the spill in the East Room on May 27, delving into the report and the problems at Interior. "And the corruption was underscored by a recent Inspector General's report that covered activity which occurred prior to 2007 -- a report that can only be described as appalling. And Secretary Salazar immediately took steps to clean up that corruption. But this oil spill has made clear that more reforms are needed." Perhaps it sells short people's capacity to tell the difference between Bush officials and Obama officials, but it's also true that if charges were filed against Norton, we would be reminded that Salazar and Obama's new appointees are supposed to be cleaning up the culture of the Interior Department, and we might worry a bit more about whether or not they have.

Marco Rubio - Gulf of Mexico - Charlie Crist - Exxon Valdez - Constitutional amendment What's Behind Charlie Crist's Constitutional Drilling Ban - Politics - The Atlantic The 14 3/4 Biggest Ideas of the Year - Nicole Allan is a staff editor at TheAtlantic.com, where she writes for the Politics Channel. She has also written for Slate and The New Republic. Florida Governor Charlie Crist has called a special session of the state legislature to debate a constitutional amendment that would ban drilling off the state's coasts. But since Florida has banned leasing and drilling in its waters since 1990, Crist's critics are calling foul. Marco Rubio, Crist's Republican opposition for Senate, called the special session a "political sideshow," and Larry Cretul, speaker of the Florida House, called it a "political ploy to further the future of politicians." So what exactly would an amendment accomplish? Crist's own press secretary has acknowledged that it would differ from the current ban "simply in the fact that the constitutional amendment would be from a majority vote of Floridians." In essence, it would be a gesture, an outlet for enraged Florida residents who are watching oil drift onto their beaches despite longstanding protection of their drilling waters. The amendment would also further entrench the current ban, making it much harder for legislators to overturn. After the Exxon Valdez spill, the Florida House and Senate passed two statutes: one to ban leasing off the state's shores, and another to ban drilling. The ban extends from three to 10 miles, depending on the region. A few years ago, the state purchased pre-existing leases. The federal government also bans drilling in federal waters off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, so the restrictions are fairly airtight. In the past few years, though, as gas prices rose and the public became more amenable to offshore drilling, the Florida legislature began to think about overturning the ban. The House passed a bill that would have lifted the ban, but the Senate knocked it down. A special council was convened to look into the pros and cons of drilling. When the BP oil well punctured, however, these efforts were put on hold. Speaker Cretul has been careful to note that the legislature is no longer considering reversing the ban. John Dowless, president of Florida's Millennium Consulting firm, thinks the amendment would put state legislators in a tough spot. "I guarantee you when gas climbs back up to $5 a gallon, they're going to say 'Drill here, drill now,'" Dowless says. "But I think it would be a little difficult for them politically to vote against the amendment right now." Once the special session is convened on July 20, legislators will have to go through an expedited version of the conventional political process: draft the amendment in committee, pass it to the floor, and obtain a 3/5 vote of both houses in order to put it on the ballot in November. From there, the amendment would need to be approved by at least 60 percent of voters. Dowless thinks that legislators will not pass it through committee in order to avoid the optics of voting against a crackdown on big oil during a big oil spill. For Crist, though, the optics are the primary draw. While he's not raging ahead of Rubio in the polls, the oil spill has so far worked to his advantage. He's received constant media exposure and has had the opportunity to cast himself as a leader in crisis.  His call for an amendment, according to Dowless, is "absolutely, 100 percent political. It's about getting poliitical headlines, it's about political posturing, it's about winning political votes." Noting Crist's vacillating stance on drilling, Dowless surmises that if Crist were not running for Senate, he would probably not be calling for the amendment.  Recent posts from our network of expert outside Correspondents Did Scott Brown Secure the Way for Financial Reform?

Illinois Sen. Roland Burris has been out of the limelight for a while, which probably is OK with him, as much of the attention after his senatorial appointment by former Gov. Rod Blagojevich wasn't all that favorable. But Environment Illinois volunteers and staff members didn't want him off the radar completely, which is one reason why they were standing out in the rain and waving placards Tuesday morning at a South Loop BP gasoline station. Environment Illinois, along with some other green groups around the nation, is worried about a pending amendment introduced by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) that would block new rules requiring cars and light trucks to use less oil. The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on the amendment, which would reject the EPA's ruling that greenhouse gases are hazardous to the public. That ruling is the basis for the EPA's authority to control the gases. Mixing rain and oil: Green group's Loop protest vs. amendment - BackTalk A dialog between Sun-Times opinion writers and our readers Mixing rain and oil: Green group's Loop protest vs. amendment By Thomas Frisbie on June 8, 2010 12:16 PM Illinois Sen. Roland Burris has been out of the limelight for a while, which probably is OK with him, as much of the attention after his senatorial appointment by former Gov. Rod Blagojevich wasn't all that favorable. But Environment Illinois volunteers and staff members didn't want him off the radar completely, which is one reason why they were standing out in the rain and waving placards Tuesday morning at a South Loop BP gasoline station. Environment Illinois, along with some other green groups around the nation, is worried about a pending amendment introduced by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) that would block new rules requiring cars and light trucks to use less oil. The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on the amendment, which would reject the EPA's ruling that greenhouse gases are hazardous to the public. That ruling is the basis for the EPA's authority to control the gases. Max Muller, program director of Environment Illinois , said he expects the vote to be close. A new analysis released by the group indicates the amendment would increase Illinois' dependence on oil by more than 17 million gallons in 2016. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin is solidly opposed to the amendment. But Environment Illinois worried that although Burris' staff had indicated he'd vote against it, the senator hadn't publicly stated his opposition. That changed Tuesday afternoon, when Burris spokesman Jim O'Connor said Burris is "solidly against" the amendment and will vote against it. Presumably, Environment Illinois will think it was worth standing in the rain to hear that.

Poll: 6 in 10 Americans Lack Faith in Obama Gang Shootout Kills Teen Tourist in US Virgin Islands Opinion: Yes We Can -- Move Beyond Oil (July 12) -- The Gulf of Mexico oil catastrophe has become the first defining moment of Barack Obama's presidency -- and not just because of the disaster's enormity or his administration's response. Rather, this has been the first real test of whether Obama is simply a very accomplished politician -- or something greater. To be an effective president, you must, of course, be a very good politician. But to be a great president -- the kind they erect monuments to (or at least name an airport after) -- requires something more than counting votes and working the phones. It requires an ability to challenge and inspire others to see possibilities that they otherwise could not. You might say it requires the ability to kindle faith. It's only been about 100 years or so that our nation has been under the spell of a seemingly inexhaustible source of cheap but dirty energy. But somehow, like an addict who can't imagine living without his fix, we've become unable to imagine our world without it. But imagine we must, because that is the inescapable reality of our future. Obama knows this. In his first-ever Oval Office address, he called on Congress to pass a climate and energy bill. A good start. But is that all? Does he think we have more confidence in Congress to provide bold leadership than we have in him? Wouldn't it make sense for the president, aided by the best minds and imaginations America has to offer, to lead Congress, and our nation, in a bold, historic endeavor? Nobody could blame the president if he has become worn down by the portfolio of crises he inherited. It's easy to imagine him putting his head down and simply perfecting the art of presidential management. But we need moral and spiritual leadership. We need to come out of denial. We need to get into a recovery from our long-term addiction to cheap but dirty energy. That requires a kind of conversion. Yes, scientists have a role at this critical moment, of course, as do economists, politicians and policymakers. But without a moral summons uttered with true moral passion and authority, we'll be no more successful at stopping our addiction than BP has been at stopping the gush of oil. What if we were to respond to the tragedy taking place in the Gulf of Mexico, and to the many other disastrous consequences of our addiction to dirty energy, with the same level of urgency and commitment that our nation displayed in restructuring the economy virtually overnight to meet the challenge of World War II? What if Obama were to make a pledge as bold as JFK's declaration that we would reach the moon before the end of a decade? What if this were President Obama's truly defining moment? If we make the commitment right now, then within 20 years -- a single generation -- we could be free from oil and all the ills it brings to our economy, our health, our environment and our climate. Instead, we could be running on clean-energy technologies, working in green jobs and living off clean corporate profits. What a gift to future generations that would be! Making it happen will demand creativity, money and education. It will require an unprecedented investment in research and development and an innovative government-business partnership (the kind the Japanese and Koreans pioneered in jump-starting their auto industries). Ultimately, it will mean imagining a different America, and a new American economy based on clean energy, not dirty energy. But before all that, it will require faith. Obama needs to have faith that he can inspire this nation he leads -- that he can be more than an effective president. Congress needs to have faith that doing what is right for our children and our grandchildren should take precedence over the demands of campaign contributors and special interests. And Americans need faith that, once again, we can accomplish what might seem impossible -- for with faith "all things are possible." Mr. President, if you set the bar high, if you issue the right challenge, you'll find us fired up and ready to go. Are you ready to make it?

Enter your address to receive news by email. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Born and raised on the Texas Gulf Coast, Ive spent the past few months trying to wrap my head around the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent massive oil spill that is now ruining the coastline from Louisiana to Florida. At times, I have to turn off the news, as the images of dying wildlife hit me deep in my gut. But now more than ever, this national tragedy has made me grateful for the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. While the oil continues to spew, the media WordPress.com bloggers included have been on the frontlines, making sure that Americans and everyone the world over know what is really happening in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill has also made me realize how fragile this freedom is as the Associated Press reported , journalists covering the Gulf of Mexico oil spill have been yelled at, kicked off public beaches and islands and threatened with arrest Which is why Im happy to announce that WordPress.com is a proud supporter of the 1 for All campaign that launches today with the simple goal of raising awareness about the First Amendment. We join more than 1,000 media outlets who have partnered with 1 for All, and we have a special connection to the project their site is hosted on WordPress.com.

So proud of WordPress for doing this. Our First Amendment rights are crucial, and it warms me to see people standing up and speaking out for whats fair. Makes me proud to be a WordPress blogger. It is a great campaign, Joy, and I hope all WordPress.com bloggers will continue to step forward from the depths and help fill in all the missing niches with the truth that is purposefully repressed to serve the majority powers vested interests. I have already written a short article on my blog. Though I am not an American, I am concerned as a citizen of the world. I guess WordPress is at the right place doing the right thing, which will have its impact. Cheers everyone out there!! That is AWESOME news! Nothing is more important than Free Speech!!! Awesome. I wish we had something similar for Canada. The recent G20 summit and the police reaction is parallel, and so is the response of bloggers keeping people informed. This is awesome, good for you WordPress. And congrats on hosting it! Looking forward to uploading some freedom pics. Lets also support the basic human right of self defense by supportingto the same unquestioned degreethe second amendment which unequivocally affirms the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. (What part of shall not be infringed do you not understand?) Great! I was just going to bloggingly join the Russian movement 31, the name of which is rooted in the number of Russian constitution article (31) about the freedom to assemble peacefully. This article is said to be notoriously denied by the government and is exercised at the governments will. The movement is about making the government follow the Constitution. So, why not make it a start, even though there are only 30 days in June July the 1st is just as good. Well done WordPress!!! All of these oil wells are ticking time bombs and the sooner we get off fossil fuels the better off we will all be. The balance of power will be taken away from the middle east and the world will become a better place. Disasters like this is what it will take to make people start to demand an alternativeit will happenbut it will take time. Worry about the federal government. This government, congress and the president is the greatest threat to our freedom in our history. There is a bill working its way through the senate giving the president the power to shut the internet down for up to 4 months. Obama during the health care debate asked for people to report those who are speaking out against the health care initiative to the government http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Facts-Are-Stubborn-Things/ Yes the oil spill is a disaster for the United States. Because of not only the First Amendment, but our entire Constitution, we are one of the greatest countries in the world. We are not without our faults. The oil spill was a wake up call. This Nation will solve the problem, learn from it, and continue to be a great nation. Proud to be a veteran and a citizen of the United States of America! COOL! Im inand tagging all my prior and future BP blogs with the appropriate 1st Amendment. This past Memorial Day was my personal anniversary for speaking out, and supporting the right of people to speak out, demonstrate their feelings and opinions in a just and legal manner. The 50th anniversary of my first arrest on behalf of civil rights for all Americans. My crime? Sitting down for a Coke at a drugstore counter with friends who happened to be Black Americans. Less than 50 miles from Congress and the White House btw. Last week I posted a blog entry about the BP oil spill. It appears that BP executives chose to cut costs in the interests of higher profits which of course always translates to higher income for executives. This mind set is endemic in corporate culture, nothing new. We can ignore little things like defective cars, etc. But consider the Columbia space shuttle disaster in May 1986 with a loss of 7 lives and a terrible set back for the space program. The cause: a defective O Ring discovered by a NASA engineera whistle blower. The lift-off must proceed on schedule so his warning was ignored. Years later we had the Challenger explosion. Now we have the BP oil spill. Once again the warnings of engineers were ignored in the pursuit of higher profits. Instead of a loss of 7 lives and setbacks for the space program, BP is in charge of destroying an entire eco system, ending a culture that has existed for generations, and put thousandsprobably millions of US citizens out of work. And the CEO wanted his life back so he could go to the yacht races. Tell that to the widow of the man who recently killed himself because he felt his life as he had known it was over. We need our First Amendment rights to continue because as writers all we have is our keyboards to fight withthe most important tool. Whilst I appreciate what you are saying and I am also gutted about the oil spill, I find myself asking but what about Mississippi and the effect of Hurricane Katrina. From an English perspective the state is still feeling the effects of the hurricane with very little effort to rebuild the place. We have a programme called Top Gear and they went through the state and were appalled at how badly it had been hit but how bad it still was. It seems a huge effort is being undertaken to cope with the effect of the oil spill, is that because Americas beautiful coast is being effected? Is it because there is more money in Florida than Mississippi? Or maybe this is what you are saying? Anyway thanks for the challenging read. As an additional comment, it is interesting that in the news section of the 1 for All page is a link to a story by the apparently misnamed First Amendment Center lauding the fact that the FCC has denied the First Amendment rights of a radical politician (KKK recruiter Robert Byrd would love this guy). The FCC requires broadcast stations to give qualified federal candidates access to airtime. The FCC does not require a station *give* candidates airtime for free, only that they are required to give them *access* to airtime and that stations may not edit or censor the ads. The FCC has now declared itself judge, jury and executioner by declaring this political hopeful is not a bona fide candidate and therefore the FCC enforcement and protection of the First Amendment as it applies to radio doesnt apply to *this* candidate. So much for trusting government to protect the Constitution and the rights of the people. Ill save most of my comments for the contest. However, living in Europe now, watching civil liberties disappear on a daily basis and seeing stringent limitations on recourse, and the silencing of legit complaint or discourse, makes me deeply appreciative of this opportunity to warn all free citizens that the cold steel shaft of the EUSSR is imminent, and that the USA is currently experiencing open and covert encroachments on its freedom. As for the Gulf, well, Ive only one year of Third Level Honours Physics, but using existing technology with a tweak here and there I could harvest that oil within a week or two. I have no doubt that if the will was there, that spill would be cleaned up weeks ago. Simply put, it IS all about freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Thank God for that! Often I just dont understand. You can walk into a convenience store and see pornography magazines in huge stands. Thats freedom. You can even worship Satan if you so choose when you are in prison and the taxpayers pay for it. Freedom of religion. Now reporters are threatened when trying to cover one of the largest oil spill disasters within our time? They are threatened because they are trying to get word to the people? Somehow it all just doesnt add up, does it? go figure! Thats good to hear. I also dont watch the news for the same reason, its too sad for me. Great initiative! It is important that we continually safeguard the freedoms that we enjoy. Will do, folks. Ill get my creative juices going this afternoon and come up with a post and tag it human rights (among other related things). Ive written on this very thing many times, as it is one of my favorite topics. Thanks for your focus. One of my favorite quotes: The only valid censorship of ideas is the right of people not to listen. (Tommy Smothers) Thanks! Even though Im not American, the First Amendment is very important! Nice job WordPress. With you all the way. America is a very greedy country (and I live here too). Extremely greedy. Extremely, extremely greedy. That is the first truth we need to deal with. America was created on the greedy killing of Indians, then a complete denial of such a thing. I am not sure if (our own countrys) greed is what really caused this oil spill, but I have a sneaking suspicion my fathers take on Independence Day these days http://kl1hbalaska.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/120/ We must continually be on the watch for those who want to erode the truths found in the deceleration on independence, the constitution and the bill of rights. These people who want to change our very way of life are not always living in a foreign country. As a freelance environmental journalist based in Canada I am thrilled to see this renewed interest in the vital role media plays in any democracy. I have been assisting my US colleagues with my contacts in covering the Gulf Oil spill. But all of us have huge problems getting our stories published as mainstream media is in major decline. Some 31,000 journalists and editors lost their jobs in the past 2 years in the US. Sure there are many good news sites on the web but who is going to pay reporters to do this important work? Who bails us out if we get arrested for taking pictures of oily turtles? What happens when we get sick? An independent and free Press needs support from the Public. I have started a Community Supported Environmental Journalism fund and helped other freelance jurnos do the same. I hope the wordpress community will use their words and their dollars to support the First Amendment otherwise it becomes a glorious sentiment on a piece of paper. Its inspiring to see WordPress standing for something so fundamental as freedom of speech. Im glad to see your post. We dont have a written constitution in my country, Britain, and although we have a (recent) freedom of information act it is not the same as your countrys constitutional rights in that regard. Over here, information can be and is still deleted, blacked out, on things that some one in a government post Secretary of State or Under Secretary decides threatens the national security if revealed. Thats fine in principle, but the fact is that folk are becoming ever more cynical about the judgement calls being used and since the Iraq War of 2003 there is a growing discontent over what we (the citizens) were told at that time (the reason for invading) and what we have leaned since, through private and public disclosures (the latter happening because of public opinion pressure). What ever the side of any argument we are on, and what ever our political persuasion, left, right center and all combinations in between, we all need, must have, the sort of basic human rights and freedoms that are declared and enshrined in your (US) Constitution, whose aspirations were written down and declared at a time of conflict, and we should all, wherever we are, if it is humanly possible, do whatever is within our reasonable and legal power though if we have not the legal power then our democracy is faulty to protect and safeguard such rights and freedoms. I wish we, over here, had such freedoms so indelibly spelt out in a written constitution, but this does not stop me, a foreigner, applauding your objective and cheering you on. Bravo! Keep it rolling! I have a link on my blog. Well done. It just so happens that today, we added a section to our blog called, Say What you Need to Say! Is it fate that both happened on the same day? Maybe were all just feeling the need to reassert our right to free speech. The American War of Independence once inspired the French Revolution. These events later inspired the Indian (India, as in South Asia) freedom fighters to raise their voice against the colonizers. I am with everyone who supports the freedom of expression in any country of the world PEACE! The 1st amendment and freedom of the press are the backbone of our civil liberties. As the child of parents who fled the Cuban communist dictatorship which still imprisons journalists to this day, I applaud WordPress for speaking out. Keep it up! congrats WP!!! i really just wanna know what theme they are using awesome site!!! I suspect that supporting and writing on forums like wordpress.com are ten times more powerful than placing a single vote, especially today, when corporations own most of our politicians. Well done WordPress and all the writers here for speaking out, for holding onto the lifeblood of our nation that throbbing red serum of truth that freedom to speak. Please, all of you check out the program below. You need to see it. All Americans, all parents, children, politicians, all people need to see this: Does your tap water ignite? Gasland is an urgent, cautionary and sometimes darkly comic look at the largest domestic natural gas drilling campaign in history. Part of the HBO Documentary Films Series. WATCH: Gasland: Trailer http://www.hbo.com Thank goodness for your site, WordPress. Thank you for being here. I have to agree with Rich. A terrible thing is happening with the oil disaster but other disasters have taken place not of an oil companys making, and involving considerable loss of life and homes. But, from news we get over here, little shouting is being done to restore normality after the Katrina hurricane disaster five years ago. Much still needs to be done after 1,836 people killed, 400,000 jobs lost. 270,000 homes gone. Of course, people have a right to demonstrate their anger and frustration. I find it rather curious though that no sorrow appears to be expressed for the 11 deaths and severe injuries of the workers. Is there no compassion for their relatives? Drilling in such deep water is fraught with problems. I am surprised that ladybard, with no experience whatsoever of such matters, can be certain (arrogantly so?) that she could fix it! Would she don a diving suit and drop a mile down with a bathtub plug? Only mechanical deep sea devices can be used. New disasters need innovative solutions. All the yelling in the world will not plug an oil leak of this nature. The safety devices (three?) (note: US manufactured) failed. The cement failed (USA company). It cannot be known why failure occurred until the leak is plugged and investigations can take place. Do you really think that BP would deliberately take more time than needed to end this dreadful tragedy? US pensioners (almost as many as British) will be losing a great deal of money too. You talk as though BP is out to destroy itself. We have seen oil disasters on our coast (remember the full oil tanker broken up on coastal rocks?) and could weep at the loss and suffering of wild life. Not exactly good for holiday businesses and fishing either. But then, in the past, we have had ports almost bombed out of existence. Nature does heal itself and businesses can be restored. Of course it takes time. Perhaps it is a good time to reflect that the USA uses more oil per capita than any other country in the world. Poor people of third world countries suffer from having their environment polluted. Who stands up for their rights? I certainly sympathise with those suffering from this disaster, but please let reason prevail. And remember those who work on oil rigs and risk their lives daily for you to drive your cars and fly the globe. You have a right of free speech. Long may that continue. But temper anger with reason and mercy. Thank you for supporting the First Amendment, of which the separation of Church and State is of utmost importance to me personally. Hopefully the oil spill will be a wake-up call to consider how destructive humans can be when we are negligible. Heres to alternative energy sources! It is not just about the Gulf issues. It is also about the kill switch that is now before the Senate. This, if it is passed, will definitely affect the First Amendment. I cannot imagine a world without communication..even for national security. There are not deadlines on this power. Here is to WordPress and to all those who will blog, photo, vid..anything in the name of the First Amendment and yesfreedom. Great idea! I think this is a very good cause. And I agree with fabstash, America is very greedy. It will be just wonderful when the time comes that we will look BACK at laws like these and wonder why they were put on the books in the first place? Meaning, the ways in which society behaves is such that a law like this no longer needs to be law as it is something that is just NORMALLY followed by everyone. Im really glad to see this development, the eroding freedom of speech in this great Land of the Free has concerned me tremendously, of late. I, too, am horrified by the suffering and destruction of the environment and precious wildlife by the BP Gulf oil debacle, and am equally curious as to why the media would be chastised and driven away from reporting on this so-called accident that is literally destroying an entire ocean, one day at a time. What is there to hide, since the obvious problem the oil is washing ashore? Perhaps something else is afoot . . . Glad to see WordPress fighting back. I am writing from New Zealand. Always listen to Alex Jones on : http://prisonplanet.tv/ Hes been warning public about this for years especially American public, but hes been considered off the wall. Glad to see Americans are waking up. We need to hear in New Zealand too. I feel for USA citizens though because you are brought up with hand on heart believing in the American Way. So there has been a blind trust in your leaders intentions. Go WordPress, because you are not fighting for your freedoms only but ours too, its all trickling in here too. Very cool. I have been writing about the Gulf Coast BP disaster since it happened and great to know WP is exactly what i thought it was very engaged in what is going on all over the world and issues that effect human beings as a whole less lip service then other blog services whoo ya Epic win for WordPress! We have a voice and it needs to be heard. People cannot silence the truth because it always comes back to the surface no matter how hard you try to bury it. Thats a wonderful way to participate Life is not just an option, its a right! Thanks you, WordPress, for your noble actions and your continued efforts in developing and maintaining Humanity as a significant and well-existent concept.. Fantastic idea. The first Amendment is the greatest law we have, in my opinion. But people should also realize the invaluable work real journalists do, especially as newspapers are going out of business, and I hope people dont continue to mistake the work of ordinary citizens and aggregator news sites with the real reports filed by journalists showing us as best they can whats going on in the world. Sunday is July 4th. We have much to be thankful for. I am thankful for freedom to be where I am and do what I am doing. I love to write, and some is from a religious background. I am thankful that I can put it out there for those who will read it, and its the peoples choice as to whether they will read it or not. I love WordPress and the liberty of writing on my blogs.This is becoming a bigger part of my day,and I havent ever written so much as now. So I applaud freedom of speech, freedom of writing, and give thanks to God for preserving our country as long as He has. I hope we have many more years of freedom. Happy 4th to you. Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter oneâs thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. As a non-American I think I probably do support the idea of this 1 for All thing, but what a shame that you had to also use this announcement to encourage people to speak out even more about human rights issues. I dont mean to imply that human rights issues arent important, they certainly are. But I read so much xenophobic crap on the internet when people are discussing human rights, and so many distortions of the truth based on what the US media has reported, (oh well, if they reported it then it must be true), and the vast majority of that crap comes from writers in the US. I just wish more people would realise that the whole world does not judge itself by the so called values of one particular nation, nor should it. A terrific endeavor. And dont forget the lessons in the First Amendment that high school journalists learn through excellent organizations such as the Student Press Law Center and the Journalism Education Association. Thank you for your commentary, and the commitment of WordPress to join 1 for All. Documenting and reporting the events in the Gulf has been and continues to be essential, as is a free press. Moreover, the power of traditional and new media to coalesce has immense potential for good. Thanks for the 1 for All link. Much appreciated. Does anyone know if its possible to get on the Friends of 1 For All list? Is it possible the people who yelled at the reporters are not government workers? Because if they are not, it is perfectly legal for them to say GTFO. But if thy are, good for you wordpress! The First Ammendment is very important. Back in the eighties, I was an Anti Contra Aid Protestor and I went on two rallies. The first was no problem except the cops made their intimidating presence felt. The second was when Regan visited a local high school and we were immediately demonised by the pro Regan crowd. I heard a lot of people tell me where I could stick my first ammendment. So, I know how important it is to fight for it. I am from Slovakia, small country in the middle Europe, and I appreciate this activity very much also because of our communist past. The catastropy in the Mexican Gulf is the matter of whole world. At my blog Im writing about it and Im happy to have the possibility to write about the things which concern me and my friends and honest people all around the world.

No crazier than the rest of whats happening our beloved country. I have friends and relatives along the coast, Im worried about all of yall every day. All day. And praying for yall too.

Along with rights, come the responsibilities and duties of the Free Press, journalists and media profit centers. Reporters, not vapid models interpreting for the viewers. The whole purpose of the Fourth Estate is to behave as though it was THEIR rights being tested, shorted and violated by the people in the positions of power, not to pursue the power for themselves. Its the Pen, not the Press Perks that wields the power of the people.

Pingback: Support the First Amendment with 1 for All (via WordPress.com News) « Orwell's Dreams I agree people need to remember we have the First Amendment and not to let others force us to be silent especially in regard to those who seek to take away religious rights and free speech. Freedom of speech is being repressed at a staggering speed in Europe. Since the signing of the Lisbon Treaty EU laws supersede many national laws. It also made the EU human rights councils rulings binding. This Human Rights council has about the same idea what constitutes free speech as the UNHRC. Having just ratified an anti-blasphemy watchdog which is just there to repress free speech. Pingback: Support the First Amendment with 1 for All (via WordPress.com News) | kenneth michael shultz When the voice of the people are silenced, the rights of the people are gone. All our rights hang on our freedom to speak truth. When the First Amendment is removed all the ammendments proceeding are vanquished. No arms to bear and no right to vote. We will have no other choice other than the right to remain silent! The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriotsThomas Jefferson As someone who lives in another country, I fully support the first amendment in principle. As long as the reporting is about something that is in the public interest it is great. The one thing I find rather unfortunate, however, is that the journalist decides how much invasion of privacy is ok in pursuit of a story, regardless of whether one wants to have ones private life spread out before the world to see. So, while it is in the public interest when it comes to stories like the oil spill, I do like the privacy rights granted to people in France for example. Unless something is in the public interest, you can be sued as a journalist for putting stuff out there that is no ones business but ones own. And ususally, in cases like this, the publication and the journalist loose. So if someone wants to jump around naked in their own house without the whole world knowing about it, one is better off living anywhere but the US. Ill be fighting for my fight to party! I very much approve of this! These days it seems that our first amendment rights have come under attack (by things like the patriot act) so Im very glad to see that something is actually being done to keep those rights safe.

BP plans to test the new cap on its blown-out Gulf oil well today. In the best-case scenario, the cap would slowly contain all the oil, a government official says. But BP still plans to eventually kill the well.

"This test involves closing one or more of the valves on the new cap for a period of time to allow BP to measure pressures in the well," retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. The process could take anywhere from six hours to two days, or longer if BP extends them. Officials say several scenarios are possible: the cap could contain all the oil; the cap could contain some of the crude while ships on the water's surface collect the rest; or, under a worst-case scenario, there could be more damage to the well's casing, meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing. Before testing began, some oil continued to gush from the upper section of the new, 18-foot, 150,000-pound cap. Video: New oil cap put to the test Video: Can the cap stop the flow of oil? Allen, who is leading the federal response to the environmental disaster, said Monday scientists will be checking the pressure inside the well, and then determining whether the cap is holding the oil in or if ships will need to continue siphoning oil. A critical step is making sure there's no hydrate buildup, according to BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. In the best-case scenario, the containment cap would have the ability to close down the valves and slowly contain all the oil, Allen said. If oil collection is still necessary, BP said it has more resources at its disposal. The oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, was put in place Monday to recover oil, joining the Q4000, which is already active. And Allen said the new cap offers a significant advantage: four collection ships could connect to the well, rather than the maximum of three allowed by the old cap. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day could be collected as part of the containment process, according to BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells. As robots put the new cap in place, Allen emphasized that work was also continuing on two relief wells, which he called "the final solution" to shutting down the leaking well. BP's Suttles said Monday that because the first relief well is five feet away from the main well, BP was estimating "kill" operations to shut down the main well could take place at the end of the month. "We're getting really, really close, it looks to me like, to at least stopping the oil," said Ed Overton, Louisiana State University professor emeritus of environmental science. "The ultimate solution, of course, is the relief well that will seal the damaged well for good... But getting the oil stopped at this point is a gigantic, gigantic step forward." Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well, causing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. The presidential commission tasked with investigating the Gulf oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling will continue its public meetings Tuesday. The National Oil Spill Commission has six months to determine what happened when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again. A new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the U.S. Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings. The government said the new moratorium, which could be in effect through November 30, is to "protect communities, coasts, and wildlife" while oil and gas companies implement safety measures to reduce the risks of blowouts and oil spills associated with deepwater drilling. But Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana told the presidential commission that the new moratorium was "unnecessary, ill-conceived and a second economic disaster for the Gulf Coast." Cherri Foytlin, whose husband works for a firm that supplies tools to drilling companies, agreed. "What I want the commission to walk away with is that we are people down here, and the moratorium and the oil spill affects people and not just big companies. When you rage against big oil like BP and Exxon, you're really raging against me," she said. CNN's Campbell Brown contributed to this report.

A missing Iranian researcher, whom Tehran claimed was abducted by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. Missing Iranian researcher takes refuge in Pakistani embassy - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Missing Iranian researcher takes refuge in Pakistani embassy By the CNN Wire Staff Iran alleges the U.S. tried to force an Iranian scientist to disclose information about Iran's nuclear program. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The Iranian scientist arrived at the Pakistani Embassy Monday night, a U.S. official said Pakistan FM: Shahram Amiri is in the Iran's Interest Section of the embassy The section is staffed and controlled by Iran Iran claims he was kidnapped to force him to give up data about Iran's nuclear program U.S. has denied charge, but remained tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected Washington (CNN) -- A missing Iranian researcher, whom Tehran claimed was abducted by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CNN Tuesday. "Iranian scientist Shahram Amiri, who was kidnapped by the Americans, had gone to the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. and taken refuge at Iran's Interest Section. He has requested to be sent back to Iran quickly," Iran's semi-official news agency Mehr said Tuesday. Abdul Basit, a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry, told CNN that Amiri arrived at the embassy at 6:30 p.m. Monday. The Iran's Interest Section, Basit said, is controlled and staffed by Iran -- with about 70 to 80 Iranian diplomats. Because Iran and the United States do not maintain diplomatic ties, the Pakistani Embassy looks after Iran's interest in Washington. It has no control over the Section, Basit said -- adding that Amiri was not a guest of, nor was he in the custody or protection of the Pakistani government. Amiri, a researcher at Tehran's Malek Ashtar University, mysteriously disappeared in June 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, according to Iranian media reports. Iran has accused the United States of involvement in Amiri's disappearance, saying the researcher was taken to force him to give up data about Tehran's nuclear program. The U.S. State Department has denied that charge, but has been tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected. Per policy, the CIA does not comment on defections. But a U.S. official, who is not authorized to talk to the media about such issues, told CNN last month that it would be "ludicrous, absurd and even preposterous" to claim an individual was kidnapped by the United States and held against his will. On Sunday, Iranian media quoted a top Iranian lawmaker as saying that newly found documents back up Tehran's claims that the CIA is responsible. "The U.S. move to kidnap Amiri runs counter to international regulations," said Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. He said Iranian officials had turned over the documents to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran. Last month, two videos surfaced on the internet of a man claiming to be Amiri, in which he said he had escaped from U.S. agents and was hiding in Virginia. That was the third time that videos allegedly showing Amiri had been circulated on the internet. In one, he said he had been kidnapped by U.S. agents. Another contradicted that claim and said he was living freely and studying in Arizona. In one of the videos posted June 30 on YouTube and dated June 14, the man again said that he was brought against his will to the United States and fears he will be discovered and re-arrested. "I am Shahram Amiri, the son of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who with God's help succeeded in running away from the U.S. security agents in the state of Virginia. I am [temporarily] at a safe place and I am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that I may shortly be again arrested by American security agents." He went on to say: "I am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people. If I face any problems or if I do not return to my country soon, the government of the U.S. would be directly responsible for it." CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos, nor the identity of the man in them. "If he is who people think he is, the U.S. would be in contact with the person," a CIA official said last month. And if he were being held against his will, "how would he have been able to produce any of the videos?" the official said. In the second video that surfaced June 30 and dated June 23, the man claiming to be Amiri reassures his family about his well-being. "I want to let my beloved family know that I am OK and they should not worry about my health," he says. "With God's help I shall return to my beloved country in the next few days. I want them to be, as always, strong and patient and to pray for my safe return. I hope to see you in our beloved country." Tehran blamed Washington for Amiri's disappearance shortly after revelations surfaced that Iran has been building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom. After that, tensions over Iran's nuclear program mounted. Iran says its nuclear energy is solely for civilian purposes. But the United States pushed the United Nations to punish Tehran for its nuclear ambitions. The Security Council recently slapped a fourth round of tough sanctions on the Islamic republic. It's unclear how much information Amiri was privy to in Iran. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr and Elise Labott contributed to this report.

Ugandan officials have recovered an explosives-laden belt from a residential area as the investigation continued Tuesday into a trio of bombings that killed at least 74 people, authorities said. Police find explosive device in Uganda discotheque - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Police find explosive device in Uganda discotheque By the CNN Wire Staff New clue found in Uganda bombings STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW : Police: Device is found in a trashcan NEW : Police: Device is similar to those found at sites of blasts NEW: Al Qaeda congratulates Al-Shabaab Somali PM: "Civilized world" should unite to combat Al-Shabaab (CNN) -- Ugandan officials have recovered what they've alternately described as an explosives-laden belt or a vest in a trashcan at a nightclub in a suburb of Kampala, the chief of police said Tuesday. Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, the chief of police, said the device -- found Monday -- was impregnated with ball bearings and was similar to those found at two sites where blasts killed at least 74 people over the weekend. The device was found along with a detonator and what looked like a laptop bag, Kayihura said. When a journalist asked him whether this meant there was a third attack planned, he said, "It's possible there was."The police chief said that his office was working with international agencies -- but would not specify who. He also would not say how many people have been arrested in connection with the attack and what their nationalities were. Why is Uganda so important? Earlier, Fred Opolot, executive director of Uganda media center, said authorities had arrested several people but they have not yet been charged in connection with the attacks, Opolot said. "We are trying to find the culprits of this atrocity," he said. The blasts went off Sunday at two venues -- a restaurant and a rugby field -- where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup soccer finals. A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for a trio of bombings. "And the best of men have promised and they have delivered," said an Arabic statement issued by Al-Shabaab's press office and obtained by CNN. "Blessed and exalted among men -- (taking) full responsibility. ...We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response." The 6,000 is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. "We are behind the attack because we are at war with them," Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. "We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country. We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us," Rage said. Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali-Sharmarke called on the "civilized world to unite in stopping the mindless terror enterprise of Al-Shabab." "We will work with our partners in Uganda and the international community in bringing the cowards responsible for this heinous act," the prime minister said in a statement released Monday. Meanwhile, al Qaeda congratulated Al-Shabaab in a message posted on pro-jihad web forums. "Be pleased because all the sincere Muslims are with you joining you in your moments of pleasure and difficulty," read part of the message. The 74 fatalities included 28 Ugandans, one Irish citizen, one Indian, one American and 11 people who are either Ethiopian or Eritrean, according to the Ugandan government. The blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates. Two others exploded at the rugby center. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning Tuesday, according to a government statement. All flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said.

A group of U.S. lawmakers have called for an investigation into whether BP may have played a role in lobbying for the release of Abdel Basset al Megrahi to secure an oil contract with the Libyan government. BP may face probe over bomber's release - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } BP may face probe over bomber's release By Jesse Solomon , CNN Convicted Pan Am bomber Abdelbaset al Megrahi boards a plane in Scotland to make his final trip home to Libya on August 20. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Senator: BP stands to earn as much as $20 billion from the deal Senators want an investigation on whether BP lobbied to secure Libyan oil contract Al Megrahi serves eight years of life sentence before his release in August He was convicted for the 1988 Pan Am bombing that killed 270 people (CNN) -- A group of U.S. lawmakers have called for an investigation into whether BP may have played a role in lobbying for the release of Abdelbaset al Megrahi to secure an oil contract with the Libyan government. Megrahi, now 58, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. He was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds in August after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. "Reports have surfaced indicating that a 2007 oil agreement may have influenced the U.K. and Scottish governments' positions concerning Mr. Megrahi's release in 2009," wrote Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in a letter to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Monday. "The families of the victims of Pan Am flight 103 deserve to know whether justice took a back seat to commercial interests in this case," Lautenberg said. Mark Salt, a spokesman for BP in Houston, Texas, declined to discuss the Senators' probe. "We're not going to comment on speculation," he said. BP, which plans to begin offshore drilling in Libya in the coming months, touted the 2007 oil agreement as "the single biggest exploration financial commitment an international energy company has ever made to Libya," according to the company's website. The troubled oil giant stands to earn as much as $20 billion from the deal, according to Lautenberg. Megrahi, who only served eight years of his life sentence for the bombing, was released by a Scottish court on "compassionate" grounds, citing a doctor's opinion at the time that he was dying from prostate cancer and had only three months to live. In a letter to the British government last week, Lautenberg was joined by Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey in calling the validity of such a prognosis into question. "Mr. Al Megrahi is still alive and reportedly living in luxury," the letter said. "The doctor responsible for the key medical opinion has told the media that not only could Mr. Al Megrahi live another 10 years, but that the Libyan government had commissioned the doctor to make his assessment." In response, the British Embassy in Washington posted a letter on its website from the British ambassador to Gillibrand on defending Megrahi's release. "The decision to grant Mr. Megrahi's compassionate release was made on the basis of advice from the Director of Health at the Scottish Prison Service, who drew on the advice of a number of medical experts," the ambassador said. Brian Kelly, who lost his brother in the attack and fought vigorously to deny Megrahi's freedom, said he isn't surprised that Megrahi is still alive and believes BP was directly responsible for his release. "You can't allow the process of justice to be corrupted by the cynical mercantilism of one company," Kelly said.

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro will make his first major public appearance in years Monday when he discusses the Middle East on a government TV program, the state-run Granma newspaper reported. Castro blames U.S. for stoking nuclear tensions - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Castro blames U.S. for stoking nuclear tensions By the CNN Wire Staff Castro makes rare TV appearance STORY HIGHLIGHTS Castro blames U.S. for sinking of South Korean ship Says any war with Iran would turn nuclear Castro has been mostly out of sight since falling ill in July 2006 Photos of Fidel Castro were published on the Internet over the weekend Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The United States is pushing for what would become nuclear wars against Iran and North Korea, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said in a rare televised interview Monday. Castro blamed the United States, not North Korea, for the sinking of a South Korean ship that killed 46 sailors. The incident was orchestrated to stir conflict in the region, Castro said. The former Cuban leader, who is 83, said he was disappointed that China and Russia didn't veto a U.N. Security Council resolution for additional sanctions against Iran for its alleged illegal nuclear program. Iran, he said, has been building up for a confrontation for 30 years. If the United States attacks Iran, it will meet a resistance unlike anything it faced in Iraq, Castro said. "A war there can't avoid becoming nuclear," Castro said. One subject Castro did not mention during the hour-long appearance was Monday's release of political prisoners. Castro spoke on Cuban TV on a show called "Roundtable." He appeared in a dark blue tracksuit worn over a plaid shirt and sat on a swivel chair that he shifted at points during the interview. His remarks were based on a column published Monday of a possible nuclear war involving the United States and Iran, sparked by conflict over that country's nuclear activities. News of Castro's television appearance appeared to resonate with some residents in the Cuban capital. "[It's] extraordinary because we want to feel him, hear him, see him, because we haven't seen him in a long time," said Havana resident Ruben Morrejon Fernandez. Monday's appearance was the second Castro sighting in the past few days. Three photographs of Castro surfaced Saturday on a pro-government blog, which claimed the photos were taken last Wednesday. The set of three photos appear to show the ailing Castro meeting with people during "a surprise visit" at the National Center of Scientific Investigations in Havana, according to a blog published by columnist Rosa C. Baez. An additional five photos -- appearing to be from the same event -- were published Saturday by the state-run media site Cubadebate. Castro has been largely out of sight since undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006. He ceded power to younger brother Raul Castro in February 2008. The elder Castro's appearance follows last week's announcement of the largest release of Cuban political prisoners in more than a decade. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church also announced Monday the names of the three more political prisoners set to be freed. They were identified as: Jesus Mustafa Felipe, Omar Rodriguez Saludes and Antonio R. Diaz Sanchez. The first prisoners to be released are expected to arrive in Madrid on Tuesday, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN on Monday. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos met with Cuban President Raul Castro and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega last week, after which the prisoner release was announced. The 52 political prisoners Cuba plans to free are the remainder of 75 dissidents jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island, according to Cuba's unofficial Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation.

The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team. NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James By the CNN Wire Staff Comments about LeBron James drew a $100,000 fine for Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NBA fines Cavs owner $100,000 for comments Gilbert's letter described James' departure as a "cowardly betrayal" Commissioner says Gilbert's words were "ill-advised and imprudent" Stern also criticizes James' handling of his decision to leave (CNN) -- The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert's words, "though understandable, were ill-advised and imprudent." In a letter posted on the team's website Thursday, Gilbert called James' decision to play for the Miami Heat a "cowardly betrayal" and a "shocking act of disloyalty." James, who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career, announced his decision to leave the team during a much-ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled "The Decision." In a press conference which was posted on the NBA's website Monday, Stern said that James was "certainly entitled" to leave the team, but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently. "I think that the advice that he received on this was poor. But his performance was fine. His honesty and his integrity I think shine through, but this decision was ill-conceived, badly produced and poorly executed," Stern said. Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert's letter showed a "property-owner's mentality." "Equally imprudent I believe are the remarks by my good friend Jesse Jackson, which purport to make this into a racial matter... he really is mistaken," Stern said. Before deciding to join the Miami Heat, James, a reigning two-time NBA MVP, looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland. He said it came down to one thing. "The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future." James said. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison.

New Mexico authorities said a former employee shot and killed five people at a business Monday in Albuquerque before turning the gun on himself. 3 dead in New Mexico business shooting, police say - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } 3 dead in New Mexico business shooting, police say By the CNN Wire Staff Some 85 employees who were inside the building at the time of the shooting were interviewed before being released. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Officers responding to 911 call find 10 people shot Three were dead -- one of them believed to be the shooter Albuquerque police believe it was a domestic violence situation that spilled into workplace One of victims believed to be wife or girlfriend of shooter, police say (CNN) -- New Mexico authorities said a former employee shot and killed two people at a business Monday in Albuquerque before turning the gun on himself. Police said officers responded to a 911 call at 9:26 a.m. (11:26 a.m. ET) that multiple shots had been fired. When officers entered the building, they found a total of 10 people shot -- three were dead, including a man believed to be the shooter, officials said. Police said after the incident that six people had died in the shooting, then Monday afternoon revised the toll to three dead. Police said there had been miscommunication among officers and emergency personnel in the first counting. "We believe this incident to be a domestic-violence workplace situation," Albuquerque Police Chief Ray Schultz said. "One of the victims -- a current employee at Emcore Corp -- is believed to be the wife or girlfriend of the shooter," Schultz said. Police officials have since corrected earlier reports identifying the shooter as a female. Police also said that they have located the children of the offender and one of his victims. Schultz would only say that the children are "OK." "We've got the neighborhood secured," Schultz said. Because of the large size of the Emcore facility, authorities were sweeping the area a second time. "We're looking under every desk, every closet, any place anyone could be concealed," Schultz told reporters. Police are continuing the investigation at a community center near Emcore Company facility where some 85 employees who were inside the building at the time of the shooting are being interviewed before being released. A website for the Emcore Corporation describes its business as fiber optics and solar power technology. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.

Crew members tell investigators they called The Caribbean Sea, which was towing a barge that collided with the tour boat, but got no answer. Two people died. Tour boat calls before crash went unanswered - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Tour boat calls before crash went unanswered By the CNN Wire Staff Since the crash, the tour boat has been lifted from the river, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said Friday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Crew of tour boat said it made radio calls before collision The Caribbean Sea was towing barge that hit tour boat Tour boat was anchored after mechanical problems Two people died in last week's collision in Delaware River (CNN) -- The crew of a tour boat that sank in a collision in the Delaware River last week made radio calls to a vessel involved in the crash, but those calls went unanswered, federal investigators said Monday. The tour boat crew told investigators that they made radio calls to the vessel Caribbean Sea that were not answered, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The Caribbean Sea was towing a barge that collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water, the report said. Two people died. One of five crew members of the Caribbean Sea, meanwhile, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to meet with investigators, the safety board said. Video: Ill fated duck boat lifted from water "We remain confident the NTSB will shed light on all of the facts surrounding this accident. Our mutual goal is to ensure nothing like this ever happens again," said Chris Herschend, president of Ride The Ducks. Since RTD Philadelphia began in 2003, there has never been a serious accident and only a handful of mechanical breakdowns, company officials said. The tour boat, the DUKW 34, carried 35 passengers and two crew members when it experienced mechanical problems about five to 10 minutes before the crash, the NTSB report said. That problem led the ship's master to anchor the tour boat. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Sea approached, towing a barge. Around 2:36 p.m., the bow of the barge hit the small tour boat, causing it to sink, investigators said. People who operated several vessels in the area have told federal investigators that they heard the tour boat's radio calls. The National Traffic Safety Board said it's looking into those accounts. The agency noted that some -- but not all -- such radio calls are recorded. Two people died as a result of the collision -- Szabolcs Prem, 20, and Dora Schwendtner, 16. Both were from Hungary.

Ugandan police recover explosives at a Kampala nightclub, following weekend attacks which killed 74 people. Al Qaeda-linked militants have claimed responsibility.

The 6,000 is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. "We are behind the attack because we are at war with them," Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. "We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country. We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us," Rage said. Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali-Sharmarke called on the "civilized world to unite in stopping the mindless terror enterprise of Al-Shabab." "We will work with our partners in Uganda and the international community in bringing the cowards responsible for this heinous act," the prime minister said in a statement released Monday. Meanwhile, al Qaeda congratulated Al-Shabaab in a message posted on pro-jihad web forums. "Be pleased because all the sincere Muslims are with you joining you in your moments of pleasure and difficulty," read part of the message. The 74 fatalities included 28 Ugandans, one Irish citizen, one Indian, one American and 11 people who are either Ethiopian or Eritrean, according to the Ugandan government. The blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates. Two others exploded at the rugby center. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning Tuesday, according to a government statement. All flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

BP is to conduct tests to assess the success of a new cap installed on its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well. Officials hope the cap could contain the oil leak completely.

"This test involves closing one or more of the valves on the new cap for a period of time to allow BP to measure pressures in the well," retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. The process could take anywhere from six hours to two days, or longer if BP extends them. Officials say several scenarios are possible: the cap could contain all the oil; the cap could contain some of the crude while ships on the water's surface collect the rest; or, under a worst-case scenario, there could be more damage to the well's casing, meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing. Before testing began, some oil continued to gush from the upper section of the new, 18-foot, 150,000-pound cap. Video: New oil cap put to the test Video: Can the cap stop the flow of oil? Allen, who is leading the federal response to the environmental disaster, said Monday scientists will be checking the pressure inside the well, and then determining whether the cap is holding the oil in or if ships will need to continue siphoning oil. A critical step is making sure there's no hydrate buildup, according to BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. In the best-case scenario, the containment cap would have the ability to close down the valves and slowly contain all the oil, Allen said. If oil collection is still necessary, BP said it has more resources at its disposal. The oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, was put in place Monday to recover oil, joining the Q4000, which is already active. And Allen said the new cap offers a significant advantage: four collection ships could connect to the well, rather than the maximum of three allowed by the old cap. Over the next two to three weeks, 60,000 to 80,000 barrels (2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons) a day could be collected as part of the containment process, according to BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells. As robots put the new cap in place, Allen emphasized that work was also continuing on two relief wells, which he called "the final solution" to shutting down the leaking well. BP's Suttles said Monday that because the first relief well is five feet away from the main well, BP was estimating "kill" operations to shut down the main well could take place at the end of the month. "We're getting really, really close, it looks to me like, to at least stopping the oil," said Ed Overton, Louisiana State University professor emeritus of environmental science. "The ultimate solution, of course, is the relief well that will seal the damaged well for good... But getting the oil stopped at this point is a gigantic, gigantic step forward." Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well, causing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. The presidential commission tasked with investigating the Gulf oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling will continue its public meetings Tuesday. The National Oil Spill Commission has six months to determine what happened when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again. A new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the U.S. Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings. The government said the new moratorium, which could be in effect through November 30, is to "protect communities, coasts, and wildlife" while oil and gas companies implement safety measures to reduce the risks of blowouts and oil spills associated with deepwater drilling. But Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana told the presidential commission that the new moratorium was "unnecessary, ill-conceived and a second economic disaster for the Gulf Coast." Cherri Foytlin, whose husband works for a firm that supplies tools to drilling companies, agreed. "What I want the commission to walk away with is that we are people down here, and the moratorium and the oil spill affects people and not just big companies. When you rage against big oil like BP and Exxon, you're really raging against me," she said. CNN's Campbell Brown contributed to this report.

The United States is pushing for what would become nuclear wars against Iran and North Korea, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro says in a rare televised interview. Castro blames U.S. for stoking nuclear tensions - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Castro blames U.S. for stoking nuclear tensions By the CNN Wire Staff Castro makes rare TV appearance STORY HIGHLIGHTS Castro blames U.S. for sinking of South Korean ship Says any war with Iran would turn nuclear Castro has been mostly out of sight since falling ill in July 2006 Photos of Fidel Castro were published on the Internet over the weekend Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The United States is pushing for what would become nuclear wars against Iran and North Korea, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said in a rare televised interview Monday. Castro blamed the United States, not North Korea, for the sinking of a South Korean ship that killed 46 sailors. The incident was orchestrated to stir conflict in the region, Castro said. The former Cuban leader, who is 83, said he was disappointed that China and Russia didn't veto a U.N. Security Council resolution for additional sanctions against Iran for its alleged illegal nuclear program. Iran, he said, has been building up for a confrontation for 30 years. If the United States attacks Iran, it will meet a resistance unlike anything it faced in Iraq, Castro said. "A war there can't avoid becoming nuclear," Castro said. One subject Castro did not mention during the hour-long appearance was Monday's release of political prisoners. Castro spoke on Cuban TV on a show called "Roundtable." He appeared in a dark blue tracksuit worn over a plaid shirt and sat on a swivel chair that he shifted at points during the interview. His remarks were based on a column published Monday of a possible nuclear war involving the United States and Iran, sparked by conflict over that country's nuclear activities. News of Castro's television appearance appeared to resonate with some residents in the Cuban capital. "[It's] extraordinary because we want to feel him, hear him, see him, because we haven't seen him in a long time," said Havana resident Ruben Morrejon Fernandez. Monday's appearance was the second Castro sighting in the past few days. Three photographs of Castro surfaced Saturday on a pro-government blog, which claimed the photos were taken last Wednesday. The set of three photos appear to show the ailing Castro meeting with people during "a surprise visit" at the National Center of Scientific Investigations in Havana, according to a blog published by columnist Rosa C. Baez. An additional five photos -- appearing to be from the same event -- were published Saturday by the state-run media site Cubadebate. Castro has been largely out of sight since undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006. He ceded power to younger brother Raul Castro in February 2008. The elder Castro's appearance follows last week's announcement of the largest release of Cuban political prisoners in more than a decade. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church also announced Monday the names of the three more political prisoners set to be freed. They were identified as: Jesus Mustafa Felipe, Omar Rodriguez Saludes and Antonio R. Diaz Sanchez. The first prisoners to be released are expected to arrive in Madrid on Tuesday, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN on Monday. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos met with Cuban President Raul Castro and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega last week, after which the prisoner release was announced. The 52 political prisoners Cuba plans to free are the remainder of 75 dissidents jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island, according to Cuba's unofficial Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation.

A group of prisoners left the island nation on a commercial flight Monday night, according to the head of Cuba's independent Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Prisoner Jose Luis Garcia Paneque was among them, his cousin, Raul Smith Paneque, told CNN from his home in Las Tunas, Cuba. A Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN Monday that the country was expecting to receive seven released dissidents and their family members, but that tally is subject to change. The arriving Cubans will receive residency permission and working papers, which is not political asylum, the spokesman said. The permission would allow the dissidents to return to Cuba at some point if they wanted. The 52 political prisoners are the remainder of a larger group of 75 dissidents who were jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island, the Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation said. News of the prisoners' departure came hours after former Cuban leader Fidel Castro spoke in a rare televised interview Monday. Castro has been largely out of sight since undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006. He ceded power to younger brother Raul Castro in February 2008. He did not mention the prisoners' release in his remarks, instead lashing out at the United States' foreign policy. His comments were based on a column published Monday, which warned of a possible nuclear war involving the United States and Iran, sparked by conflict over that country's nuclear activities.

A 23-year-old Russian who came to light during the recent spy case is in federal custody, a U.S. government official told CNN Tuesday. Russian who emerged in recent spy case in U.S. custody - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Russian who emerged in recent spy case in U.S. custody By the CNN Wire Staff Ten Russians suspected of spying in the U.S. have been sent back to Russia. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The man is expected to be deported soon The Russian has been monitored since he came to the United States in October The development comes after last week's spy swap (CNN) -- A 23-year-old Russian who came to light during the recent spy case is in federal custody, a U.S. government official told CNN Tuesday. The man is not suspected of passing any classified information to Russia, like the 10 Russian agents who each pleaded guilty to a charge of acting as foreign agents, the official said. The man is expected to be deported soon, said the official, who couldn't say where the man is being held. The official, who called the 10 suspected spies who were deported "small fish," said the 23-year-old Russian wasn't "even in the aquarium." The Russian received a visa to enter the United States last July, came to the United States in October and has been monitored ever since, the official said. The 10 Russian agents were part of a swap completed last week between the United States and Russia. The United States transferred the 10 to the Russian Federation and the federation released four people imprisoned for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies. Authorities have lost track of another suspect, who was detained in Cyprus, released on bail, and then failed to check in with authorities as he had been required to do. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS Defense Ministry spokesman says Afghan soldier fled after firing on British soldiers NATO and Afghan officials are investigating the incident Petraeus: "We must ensure that the trust between our force remains solid" Afghan Army Chief of Staff: Those responsible will be prosecuted (CNN) -- Investigators are searching for an Afghan National Army soldier who shot a rocket at British soldiers in Helmand province, killing three and injuring four others early Tuesday morning, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman said. "We believe these were the actions of a lone individual who has betrayed his ISAF and Afghan comrades," a U.K. military spokesman said. "His whereabouts are currently unknown but we are making strenuous efforts to find him." In a statement released Tuesday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the soldiers were killed at an army patrol base manned by NATO and Afghan troops. The statement said NATO and Afghan officials were investigating the incident. "We have sacrificed greatly together, and we must ensure that the trust between our forces remains solid in order to defeat our common enemies," Gen. David Petraeus said in a statement. Petraeus, the top commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said working together was paramount. "This is a combined, joint mission, Afghan and Alliance troopers fighting shoulder-to-shoulder against the Taliban and other extremists," he said. Afghan Army Chief of Staff Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi expressed sympathies to the families of the deceased soldiers, describing them as "coalition partners." "Our ongoing, partnered investigation will seek to determine how this event could have occurred and we will prosecute those responsible," he said in a statement. The British Ministry of Defence echoed the mourning, calling the shooting incident a "suspected premeditated attack." "This is a despicable and cowardly act, and my thoughts go out to the family and friends of those who have lost their lives," said British Defence Secretary Liam Fox. "This incident will be thoroughly investigated by ISAF and the Afghan security forces, and we will do everything we can to bring the individual responsible to justice." "Training and developing the Afghan National Security Forces is vital to the international mission in Afghanistan and today's events will not undermine the real progress we continue to make. British and ISAF forces are working shoulder to shoulder with Afghans and will continue to do so undeterred," Fox said.

A missing Iranian researcher, whom Tehran claimed was abducted by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. Missing Iranian researcher takes refuge in Pakistani embassy - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Missing Iranian researcher takes refuge in Pakistani embassy By the CNN Wire Staff Iran alleges the U.S. tried to force an Iranian scientist to disclose information about Iran's nuclear program. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The Iranian scientist arrived at the Pakistani Embassy Monday night, a U.S. official said Pakistan FM: Shahram Amiri is in the Iran's Interest Section of the embassy The section is staffed and controlled by Iran Iran claims he was kidnapped to force him to give up data about Iran's nuclear program U.S. has denied charge, but remained tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected Washington (CNN) -- A missing Iranian researcher, whom Tehran claimed was abducted by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CNN Tuesday. "Iranian scientist Shahram Amiri, who was kidnapped by the Americans, had gone to the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. and taken refuge at Iran's Interest Section. He has requested to be sent back to Iran quickly," Iran's semi-official news agency Mehr said Tuesday. Abdul Basit, a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry, told CNN that Amiri arrived at the embassy at 6:30 p.m. Monday. The Iran's Interest Section, Basit said, is controlled and staffed by Iran -- with about 70 to 80 Iranian diplomats. Because Iran and the United States do not maintain diplomatic ties, the Pakistani Embassy looks after Iran's interest in Washington. It has no control over the Section, Basit said -- adding that Amiri was not a guest of, nor was he in the custody or protection of the Pakistani government. Amiri, a researcher at Tehran's Malek Ashtar University, mysteriously disappeared in June 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, according to Iranian media reports. Iran has accused the United States of involvement in Amiri's disappearance, saying the researcher was taken to force him to give up data about Tehran's nuclear program. The U.S. State Department has denied that charge, but has been tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected. Per policy, the CIA does not comment on defections. But a U.S. official, who is not authorized to talk to the media about such issues, told CNN last month that it would be "ludicrous, absurd and even preposterous" to claim an individual was kidnapped by the United States and held against his will. On Sunday, Iranian media quoted a top Iranian lawmaker as saying that newly found documents back up Tehran's claims that the CIA is responsible. "The U.S. move to kidnap Amiri runs counter to international regulations," said Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. He said Iranian officials had turned over the documents to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran. Last month, two videos surfaced on the internet of a man claiming to be Amiri, in which he said he had escaped from U.S. agents and was hiding in Virginia. That was the third time that videos allegedly showing Amiri had been circulated on the internet. In one, he said he had been kidnapped by U.S. agents. Another contradicted that claim and said he was living freely and studying in Arizona. In one of the videos posted June 30 on YouTube and dated June 14, the man again said that he was brought against his will to the United States and fears he will be discovered and re-arrested. "I am Shahram Amiri, the son of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who with God's help succeeded in running away from the U.S. security agents in the state of Virginia. I am [temporarily] at a safe place and I am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that I may shortly be again arrested by American security agents." He went on to say: "I am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people. If I face any problems or if I do not return to my country soon, the government of the U.S. would be directly responsible for it." CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos, nor the identity of the man in them. "If he is who people think he is, the U.S. would be in contact with the person," a CIA official said last month. And if he were being held against his will, "how would he have been able to produce any of the videos?" the official said. In the second video that surfaced June 30 and dated June 23, the man claiming to be Amiri reassures his family about his well-being. "I want to let my beloved family know that I am OK and they should not worry about my health," he says. "With God's help I shall return to my beloved country in the next few days. I want them to be, as always, strong and patient and to pray for my safe return. I hope to see you in our beloved country." Tehran blamed Washington for Amiri's disappearance shortly after revelations surfaced that Iran has been building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom. After that, tensions over Iran's nuclear program mounted. Iran says its nuclear energy is solely for civilian purposes. But the United States pushed the United Nations to punish Tehran for its nuclear ambitions. The Security Council recently slapped a fourth round of tough sanctions on the Islamic republic. It's unclear how much information Amiri was privy to in Iran.

Portugal's credit rating cut by Moody's - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Portugal's credit rating cut by Moody's By David Oakley , Capital Markets Correspondent The U.S. credit agency is pessimistic about Portugal's economic growth in the medium term. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The U.S. rating agency cut Portugal's long-term credit rating to A1 from Aa2 Concerns over its debt to gross domestic product and debt to revenue ratios Moody's: "We remain concerned about the economy's medium-term growth" (FT) -- Moody's, the rating agency, downgraded Portugal by two notches on Tuesday, citing the country's deteriorating public finances. The U.S. rating agency cut Portugal's long-term credit rating to A1 from Aa2 on concerns over its debt to gross domestic product and debt to revenue ratios, which have risen rapidly over the past two years. The agency warned that Portugal's debt to GDP ratio will approach 90 percent, while its debt to revenue ratio will rise to 210 percent over the next two or three years. This means Portugal will remain highly indebted while its economy struggles to recover. Anthony Thomas, a senior analyst in Moody's sovereign risk group, said: "We remain concerned about the economy's medium-term growth potential." The agency says a more severe deterioration in the country's debt metrics in the event of higher interest rates or weaker economic growth cannot be completely ruled out. Are the ratings agencies credit worthy? The euro fell against the dollar and Portuguese equity and bond markets came under pressure, as investors said Moody's announcement was a sign that the country had a long way to go in reforming and reviving its economy. Moody's rating of A1 remains an investment grade, but is lower than that of Fitch and higher than that of Standard &amp; Poor's. © The Financial Times Limited 2010 .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

Police fanned out across Italy on Tuesday on a major crackdown on the crime syndicate, the 'Ndrangheta, prosecutors said. Hundreds sought in Italian crime syndicate crackdown - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Hundreds sought in Italian crime syndicate crackdown By the CNN Wire Staff Italy's Interior Minister, Roberto Maroni, says the sweep is the most important operation against the 'Ndrangheta in years. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The group is prevalent in south Italy Authorites hope to arrest 300 suspects The suspects are wanted for crimes ranging from theft to murder Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Police fanned out across Italy Tuesday on a major crackdown on the crime syndicate, the 'Ndrangheta, prosecutors said. The operation, called "The Crime," is seeking to arrest between 200 and 300 people on charges ranging from receiving stolen goods to murder. The operation is being headed by Milan prosecutors Ilda Bocassini and Giuseppe Pignatone. Italy's Interior Minister, Roberto Maroni, praised the operation in a statement. 'It's absolutely the most important operation against the 'Ndrangheta in the last years. It's a shot in the heart of the criminal system under the economical and logistic point of view," the statement said. The group is prevalent in the Calabria region of south Italy and seen as similar to the Sicilian Mafia. But the group has stretched to many other countries. In 2004, authorities said they linked the 'Ndrangheta to an international drug trafficking network involving gangs in South America and Australia.

Hall of Fame football linebacker Lawrence Taylor is scheduled to be in a New York courtroom Tuesday to answer accusations that he raped a 16-year-old girl. Former star linebacker Taylor due in court for alleged rape - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Former star linebacker Taylor due in court for alleged rape By the CNN Wire Staff Lawrence Taylor is expected to enter a plea during a court appearance Tuesday in Ramapo, New York. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Lawrence Taylor to appear in court Tuesday Former linebacker is charged with rape, patronizing prostitute Police investigate accusations involving 16-year-old runaway Taylor's lawyer has vehemently denied allegations (CNN) -- Hall of Fame football linebacker Lawrence Taylor is scheduled to be in a New York courtroom Tuesday to answer accusations that he raped a 16-year-old girl. The former New York Giants star is scheduled to appear at 9:30 a.m. Though Taylor's lawyer has vehemently denied the charges against him, Taylor is expected to formally enter a plea Tuesday. Taylor was arrested in a Holiday Inn room a few hours after the alleged rape took , according to Christopher St. Lawrence, the town supervisor and police commissioner. Ramapo is a town about 30 miles northwest of New York City. Police Chief Peter Brower said Taylor was charged with third-degree rape, a felony, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17. Taylor also was charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage victim $300 to have sex, Brower said. According to Brower, the rape charge carries a possible four-year prison term, and the patronization charge, a misdemeanor, could bring up to a year in prison. Asked whether Taylor knew that the victim was underage, Brower said "ignorance is not an excuse" for having sex with a minor. Taylor's lawyer, Arthur Aidala said at an ealier bail hearing that: "My client did not have sex with anybody. Period. Lawrence Taylor did not rape anybody." Police said the alleged victim, since March a runaway from New York's Bronx borough, was allegedly brought to the town by a pimp. A punishing tackler and pass rusher known by his initials "L.T.," he was on two Super Bowl champion teams and was inducted into the National Football League's Hall of Fame, which noted that he "redefined the way the outside linebacker position was played." However, Taylor was twice suspended by the NFL for substance abuse and battled a cocaine addiction long after retirement, resulting in several arrests and a downward spiral that he chronicled in a 2003 autobiography. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

The United States is pushing for what would become nuclear wars against Iran and North Korea, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said in a rare televised interview Monday. Castro blames U.S. for stoking nuclear tensions - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Castro blames U.S. for stoking nuclear tensions By the CNN Wire Staff Castro makes rare TV appearance STORY HIGHLIGHTS Castro blames U.S. for sinking of South Korean ship Says any war with Iran would turn nuclear Castro has been mostly out of sight since falling ill in July 2006 Photos of Fidel Castro were published on the Internet over the weekend Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The United States is pushing for what would become nuclear wars against Iran and North Korea, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said in a rare televised interview Monday. Castro blamed the United States, not North Korea, for the sinking of a South Korean ship that killed 46 sailors. The incident was orchestrated to stir conflict in the region, Castro said. The former Cuban leader, who is 83, said he was disappointed that China and Russia didn't veto a U.N. Security Council resolution for additional sanctions against Iran for its alleged illegal nuclear program. Iran, he said, has been building up for a confrontation for 30 years. If the United States attacks Iran, it will meet a resistance unlike anything it faced in Iraq, Castro said. "A war there can't avoid becoming nuclear," Castro said. One subject Castro did not mention during the hour-long appearance was Monday's release of political prisoners. Castro spoke on Cuban TV on a show called "Roundtable." He appeared in a dark blue tracksuit worn over a plaid shirt and sat on a swivel chair that he shifted at points during the interview. His remarks were based on a column published Monday of a possible nuclear war involving the United States and Iran, sparked by conflict over that country's nuclear activities. News of Castro's television appearance appeared to resonate with some residents in the Cuban capital. "[It's] extraordinary because we want to feel him, hear him, see him, because we haven't seen him in a long time," said Havana resident Ruben Morrejon Fernandez. Monday's appearance was the second Castro sighting in the past few days. Three photographs of Castro surfaced Saturday on a pro-government blog, which claimed the photos were taken last Wednesday. The set of three photos appear to show the ailing Castro meeting with people during "a surprise visit" at the National Center of Scientific Investigations in Havana, according to a blog published by columnist Rosa C. Baez. An additional five photos -- appearing to be from the same event -- were published Saturday by the state-run media site Cubadebate. Castro has been largely out of sight since undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006. He ceded power to younger brother Raul Castro in February 2008. The elder Castro's appearance follows last week's announcement of the largest release of Cuban political prisoners in more than a decade. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church also announced Monday the names of the three more political prisoners set to be freed. They were identified as: Jesus Mustafa Felipe, Omar Rodriguez Saludes and Antonio R. Diaz Sanchez. The first prisoners to be released are expected to arrive in Madrid on Tuesday, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN on Monday. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos met with Cuban President Raul Castro and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega last week, after which the prisoner release was announced. The 52 political prisoners Cuba plans to free are the remainder of 75 dissidents jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island, according to Cuba's unofficial Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation.

The first group of political prisoners freed by the Cuban government has arrived in Madrid, the capital of Spain, the state-run EFE news agency reported Tuesday. 6 freed political prisoners from Cuba arrive in Spain, government says - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } 6 freed political prisoners from Cuba arrive in Spain, government says By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTS A seventh political prisoner already released is on another plane They are the first group among 52 jailed dissidents to be released The seven dissidents were accompanied by 26 family members The six men posed briefly for photographs Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The first group of political prisoners freed by the Cuban government has arrived in Madrid, the capital of Spain, and briefly posed for photographs at a news conference. Six Cuban dissidents and some family members were aboard the aircraft that landed at Madrid's Barajas airport, the Spanish government said. A second aircraft that had not arrived yet carried a seventh dissident and family members. The seven are among 52 political prisoners the Cuban government agreed last week to release. The six dissidents who arrived in Madrid said in a joint statement read by former captive Julio Cesar Galvez that they hope the prisoner release will be a first step toward democracy in Cuba. The dissidents also expressed their desire that their 45 "brothers" who are yet to be released will soon gain their freedom. In addition to Galvez, the other former prisoners on the first flight were identified as Lester Gonzalez, Pablo Pacheco Avila, Omar Ruiz Hernandez, Jose Luis Garcia Paneque and Antonio Villarreal Acosta. The dissident on the second plane was identified as Ricardo Gonzalez Alfonso, who is said to be ill. Twenty-six family members accompanied the dissidents, a Spanish government official told CNN. The six men who had arrived posed for photographs for a few seconds before being led away. Five of them wore white shirts and ties. The sixth wore an open-necked short-sleeve striped shirt. In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying the United States welcomes the release of the seven prisoners. "While the United States continues to call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, this is a positive development that we hope will represent a step towards increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba," the State Department said. "All those released from prison should be free to decide for themselves whether to remain in Cuba or travel to another country."

I had been standing on the street with Jaime Lerner for less than one minute when a stranger stopped to greet him.

"Hello Mr. Mayor!" said a young woman carrying a backpack. A mere 30 seconds passed before another person did the same. "Oh, my governor! How are you, sir?" said an older gentleman. "Good morning," Lerner purred in Portuguese as we made our way towards the thing that made him a hero to his fellow Curitibans and an inspiration to a generation of urban planners around the planet: the bus. Curitiba's Bus Rapid Transit system is one of the most admired public transportation systems on the planet, garnering accolades and spawning spin-off systems in cities like Bogotá and Los Angeles. Curitiba's six dedicated fast-lane bus lines traverse the city, carrying 36,000 passengers per hour and 2.3 million overall every day. It's affordable too -- a single fare costs $1.25 and will take you 20 kilometers outside downtown. "You [pay] before entering the bus and you [board] at the same level. And the frequency is less than one minute. It's like a subway. You don't have to wait more than one minute. So it's a good service," said Lerner, a stout polyglot who speaks seven languages. We then climbed the steps to the elevated glass tube that functions as the enter/exit point and boarded the orange line towards the city center. As we cruised along, even more people stopped to shake Lerner's hand, and it quickly became apparent to me that his reputation as an "eco-pioneer" is well deserved. What's more, it seems that the people who appreciate his work the most are his former constituents, who reap the rewards of his innovative thinking on a daily basis. "I do think this city was a pioneer. It was a learning process and we quickly started to understand that you have to work fast," said Lerner. Working fast is what got Lerner elected as Curitiba's mayor three times, and later twice-elected as governor of the Brazilian State of Parana. He and his young fellow architects conceived Curitiba's Master Plan in the mid 1960s, which soon resulted in the bus system as well as pedestrian-only streets, more parks, and later, a unique trash-for-cash recycling program that encouraged people to turn in garbage and reusable materials in exchange for food and other goods. Word soon spread throughout Brazil and then the world about Curitiba's progressive and environmentally-friendly initiatives, earning it a reputation as one of the "greenest" cities on earth. Lerner now spends much of his time traveling the world and sharing his vision with others. "Every city can improve its quality of life in less than three years. No matter the scale of the city, no matter the financial conditions," Lerner said. "When we realize that 75 percent of carbon emissions are related to the cities, it is the cities where we can be most effective." But even Lerner, 73, has to deal with the daily reality of moving around a city with 3.2 million inhabitants. He owns a car but says he tries to use it only when necessary, and is constantly encouraging city planners to create work and living quarters located close to one another. To this end, Lerner certainly practices what he preaches: his office is located across the street from his high-rise apartment. "My door-to-door trip takes about 40 seconds. It's a tough commute," he joked. Every city can improve its quality of life in less than three years. No matter the scale of the city, no matter the financial conditions. --Jaime Lerner, architect and former Mayor of Curitiba, Brazil. Brazil's booming economy means more cars on the roads these days, and even in Curitiba there's gridlock, something that I witnessed firsthand during my first day in the city. But I soon learned that it only increases many Curitibans' love for the bus. "I take the bus and I am home in 20 or 40 minutes. In a car, it can take an hour and a half," office worker Cibele Bassi said. "On the bus I only spend 2 reales. For my car, I need 10 reales worth of gas. So it's better to suffer a little on the bus than to drive my car," said Octavio Silva, a hospital employee. In addition to its lauded bus system, Curitiba also boasts plentiful parks -- there are 51 square meters of green space per person in the city -- one of the highest per capita rates on the planet. One of those spaces is the Curitiba Botanical Garden, a sprawling park filled with flowers, ponds and trees. Its art-nouveau style greenhouse is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. That's where I met Fabio Duarte, a professor of Urban Planning at the Pontifical Catholic University of Parana who told me that Lerner's global reputation as an eco-pioneer is well deserved. "He said this little city in the middle of Brazil has something to say; we can have good public transportation, we can have public parks, we can have some kind of recycling garbage program, and this is very important," said Duarte. Still, Duarte criticized Curitiba's citizens and current leaders for becoming complacent in recent years. "Most of the programs that Jaime Lerner and his team started 30 years ago....have been left alone or neglected. Public programs can't be left alone. We must be there everyday to maintain them," he said. Lerner left politics in 2002 and now dedicates his time to his architecture firm, which has worked on urban planning projects for cities including Shanghai in China, Perm in Russia, Mazatlan in Mexico and Luanda in Angola. He is also designing an electric mini-car, the Dock Dock, that he hopes will clear congested roads and reduce carbon emissions. Lerner says he is proud of his accomplishments, but there's still much for him and others to do. "There are three major issues now that are becoming important, not only for cities, but for all mankind: Mobility, sustainability -- which is linked to mobility -- and social diversity." They are all issues that Lerner told me he hopes other city dwellers around the world will start to embrace. And with his infectious enthusiasm leading the way, I am confident that more and more will. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

Six months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, a United Nations representative on the ground there says many challenges still lie ahead in the aftermath of the "worst living disaster." UN rep: Haiti recovering but struggling after 'worst living disaster' - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } UN rep: Haiti recovering but struggling after 'worst living disaster' By Katya Lebedev and Brooke Elliott , CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTS U.N. rep in Haiti says progress has been made but many problems still ahead U.N. says 1,300 camping sites, 11,000 latrines built Rep cites access to clean water and medical facilities as preventing disease outbreaks United Nations (CNN) -- Six months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, a United Nations representative on the ground there says many challenges still lie ahead in the aftermath of the "worst living disaster." Nigel Fisher, the deputy special representative for the stabilization mission in Haiti, told the U.N. press via video-conference Monday that progress has been made in rehabilitating the country, but that the nation still faces many problems. The January 12 quake left over 220,000 dead, over 300,000 injured, and over a million homeless. According to recent U.N. reports, the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure, and left 180,000 homes uninhabitable. Six months later, 1.6 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps, and Fisher does not anticipate the number in camps to reduce soon. According to the United Nations, 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built, and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need. Fisher said that despite a lack of communication, destroyed roads and lack of transportation and railway systems, food was delivered relatively quickly to displaced Haitians. The response from the international community, Fisher said, was "quite significant." Houses that were not structurally damaged are being rebuilt at a relatively low cost, though tents and camps are undergoing their second "phase of replacement." An unforeseen difficulty of "land tenure," especially in a "place where land ownership has been disputed for years," has significantly slowed down the process of building more permanent houses in preparation for the hurricane season. "It is important to remember what Haiti was and what Port-au-Prince was before the earthquake: two-thirds of the population was living in poverty, many lacked access to clean water and were living in slums," Fisher said. According to 2009 U.N. reports, 55 percent of Haitians lived on less than $1.25 a day, and per capita annual income was US $660. Fifty-eight percent of children were under-nourished and 58 percent of the population lacked access to clean water. The earthquake followed the devastating 2008 earthquakes that affected 800,000 Haitians, and deforestation left the country with less than 2 percent forest cover. "Then, the catastrophic earthquake left 230,000 dead, 300,000 injured and an estimated one million homeless. In addition, 17 million cubic meters of debris were scattered on the streets." Fischer explained. Fischer said the relocation of displaced families from the camps to newly built homes has posed a problem because of two main concerns on the part of family members: the need for a job and for a nearby school where their children could receive an education. Furthermore, the private sector, which has been damaged by the "overwhelming response from the international community," has experienced a loss of clients and "extremely high interest rates" that Risher said can be solved only through recapitalization of the private sector by the country itself. But with a focus more on urban reconstruction and the development of a closer link between government and education, Fisher said Haiti could become a better nation than it was before the earthquake. "We have a long way to go, but things could have been much worse." Nutritional status and general health "has not worsened in the months since the earthquake," he said. "There has been no epidemic of cholera or measles," Fisher stated, because access to clean water and free medical facilities have reduced chances of an outbreak. He asserted even that the U.N. mission has seen improvement in some of the camps. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

The first of 52 political prisoners to be released in Cuba are scheduled to arrive Tuesday in Spain on two commercial flights, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN on Monday. Spain: Freed Cuban political prisoners to arrive Tuesday - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Spain: Freed Cuban political prisoners to arrive Tuesday By the CNN Wire Staff The wives of jailed Cuban dissidents - known as the Ladies in White - pray in Havana's Fifth Avenue on Sunday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The dissidents were detained during a 2003 crackdown Release follows visit by Spanish foreign minister Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The first of 52 political prisoners to be released in Cuba are scheduled to arrive Tuesday in Spain on two commercial flights, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN on Monday. Though the tally is subject to change, Spain is expecting seven released dissidents and their family members, the spokesman said. The arriving Cubans will receive residency permission and working papers, which is not political asylum, the spokesman said. The permission would allow the dissidents to return to Cuba at some point if they wanted. Six of the dissidents and their family are scheduled to arrive on one flight. The seventh will be on another flight, accompanied by family members.

Anderson Cooper returns to Haiti with exclusive interviews with former President Bill Clinton and actor Sean Penn. Don't miss 'AC360' tonight at 10 ET, only on CNN. Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- On January 12, the earth shook here. More than 220,000 people were killed. More than 300,000 people were injured. The city and large stretches of surrounding countryside were devastated. Six months later, not much appears to have changed. It still looks like a bomb just dropped on this city. The government has barely begun the cleanup process. Roads in the center of the city are still blocked by debris. And some experts predict that it could take up to 20 years to remove all of it. "We have moved 250,000 cubic meters of rubble, which sounds like a lot, until you realize there's 20 million cubic meters of rubble here," said Imogen Wall, spokeswoman for the United Nations office of humanitarian affairs in Haiti. The U.N. estimates 1.5 million people currently live in camps. That means roughly one in nine Haitians are homeless. And Wall says the situation is so difficult that six months from now, it may still look the same. "Because of the numbers that we are coping with here and what we know about what it takes to do long-term reconstruction well... it will take time to get 1.5 million people back into the kind of long-term living arrangements that they want and need," she said. Most Haitians are left fending for themselves. CNN iReport: Former Black Crowes bassist tours Haiti devastation In one impoverished hilltop slum, where people live side-by-side with the rubble of their neighbors' homes, locals made a terrible discovery Saturday: body parts of a pregnant woman in her 20s who had gone missing after the earthquake . "Horrible. It's sad," neighbor Pierre Fouriol said. It's a tragic scene that is still unfolding all over the city. The Haitian government says it cannot tackle debris clean-up or the resettlement of homeless right now, because it faces more immediate threats. "The real priority of the government is to protect the population from the next hurricane season, and most of our effort right now is going right now in that direction," Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said. But many Haitians are taking matters into their own hands. Jean-Jacques Jerome is hammering pieces of wood together, building a new house to replace the one that was destroyed in the earthquake. "I couldn't afford new construction material," he says, "so I scavenged parts from the street, from junk piles and from rubble." From the rubble of a devastated city, a new generation of makeshift housing is going up, which will likely be even more vulnerable to the floods and killer storms that plague Haiti. Meanwhile, the presidential palace remains in ruins. Even the most powerful people in the country have barely begun picking up the pieces. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

The Colombian military killed 12 Marxist guerrilla rebels in a gunbattle Sunday in the central state of Tolima, President Alvaro Uribe said on his website. Colombian army kills 12 FARC rebels, president says - CNN.com #hdr-prompt-text b { display:inline-block;margin:0 0 0 20px; } Colombian army kills 12 FARC rebels, president says By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ten Colombian soldiers killed in separate attack A female rebel leader was among those killed, government says FARC has been waging war on government since the mid-1960s The guerrillas are said to be involved in the drug trade to finance insurrection (CNN) -- The Colombian military killed 12 Marxist guerrilla rebels in a gunbattle Sunday in the central state of Tolima, President Alvaro Uribe said on his website. Ten Colombian soldiers were killed Sunday in a separate confrontation with guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known by its Spanish acronym FARC, the nation's military said. The surprise 1 a.m. attack on the FARC guerrillas was carried out by police, army and air force personnel in the nation's central mountain range, Uribe said. Among those killed was a female rebel leader known as "Maryeri," responsible for the deaths of 70 soldiers in the past eight years, Uribe said. The rebel group was responsible for 30 attacks in Tolima in the past two years, the president said. The 10 Colombian army soldiers were killed Sunday morning in a firefight with FARC guerrillas in Arauca state in northeastern Colombia, the military said. The rebels were trying to blow up an electric plant and opened fire when the soldiers approached, the military said Sunday on its website. The FARC has been waging war on the Colombian government since the mid-1960s. Officials say the guerrillas are involved in the drug trade to finance their insurgency. The FARC also has carried out a series of abductions over the years and is believed to still hold more than a dozen captives. The rebels released a hostage in March, and the Colombian military rescued four captives in June. .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.

Whether he's out on the ocean monitoring stingrays in the Caribbean, or back on land painting in his studio, Guy Harvey spends all his time surrounded by fish.

Raised in Jamaica and educated in Scotland, Harvey is one of the world's leading conservationists with a first class degree in marine biology and a PhD in fisheries management. His love of the sea and ecology inspired Harvey to found the Guy Harvey Research Institute in 1999 which provides scientific information about fish protection and biodiversity. But this is only half of Harvey's remarkable story. He is a highly successful businessman with a chain of seafood restaurants and a self-taught artist whose depictions of game fish have become world famous. "I didn't go to art class or art school, never took a lesson in my life. I learned everything from trial and error and it's this persistence, I suppose, with the illustrative content which got me to where I am," Harvey told CNN. Ernest Hemmingway's novella, "The Old Man and the Sea" inspired Harvey's obsession with game fish and moved him to depict the famous fishing story in a series of pen and ink drawings a quarter of a century ago. He paints every day and 10 percent of the proceeds of all the paintings he sells goes straight back into his eco-organizations. Harvey also created a TV series, "Portraits of the Deep," to showcase game fish and their importance to the environment. "To see them underwater in their glowing, feeding and moving colors, their aggression colors are probably one of the most exciting things you can do as a diver," Harvey said. These videos play constantly in his stores and his restaurants where Harvey's art is also on the walls, and only sustainable fish species are on the menu. Harvey's marine expertise has also helped to pioneer techniques of recording billfish underwater and a tagging system to monitor them over long distances. More recently, he's taken on the plight of sharks. Hunted for their fins, the loss of these predators could affect the oceans' fragile balance. Harvey's recent Ultimate Shark Challenge was a catch-and-release fishing tournament held off the Southwest Florida coast. Endangered sharks were tagged for study and not a single one was strung up in the dock. Sharks are also in danger in the Gulf of Mexico because of the BP oil leak. Harvey fears other fish are at risk too. He's planning a new line of t-shirts to raise funds for research. "We have no idea when this is going to stop or how far it's going to reach and what the life span of this disaster is going to be," Harvey said. From the study of stingrays, to the most pressing conservation issues in global fisheries, the diver, artist, scientist, and businessman is always promoting the preservation of marine ecology. "Fish are just stinking fish to most people. They have their filet that comes on the plate or you buy it in the fish mongers and it comes in a cellophane bag and it's dead and cold and smelly. These are beautiful graceful ocean predators that need our respect. "I want to leave people feeling that, you know, we really need to think more about how we use the ocean and everything that's in it and if I've achieved that, then that will do it for me." .cnn_strycrcntrnwsp .cnn_mtpmore { padding:10px 0px 1px 0px; } Paul the octopus retires with World Cup record intact New cap on ruptured oil well faces key tests NBA fines Cavaliers owner for remarks on LeBron James Defense Ministry: Afghan soldier fired on British troops, killing 3 Home | Video | World | U.S. | Africa | Asia | Europe | Latin America | Middle East | Business | World Sport | Entertainment | Tech | Travel | iReport Tools &amp; Widgets | RSS | Podcasts | Blogs | CNN Mobile | My Profile | E-mail Alerts | CNN Radio | CNN Shop | Site map | CNN Partner Hotels | CNN Traveller CNN en ESPAÑOL | CNN Chile | CNN México | | | | © 2010 Cable News Network.
