It amazes me how good high schoolers are. That guy caught the pass in the middle photo for the first TD of the game. The last photo was after a dropped pass.  The incompletion didn't decide the game or anything but the poor guy was so frustrated at himself, he was taken back out to the sidelines the next play and I watched him hang his head on the sidelines and angrily unsnap his chin strap.  I always say that sports really don't matter, they are just a distraction, but say that to the senior who won't forget that pass for the rest of his life, then I remember my last high school soccer game or cross country race and go back on my words.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-3219998502949323656?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>

It was a dark morning, but pockets of shine glowed from the wet street and streaks of light reflected off the crisp grass.  Mid-day I found myself behind a velvet rope, shooting dignitaries rededicating a university library. It was a stale waxy photograph and I had shot it ten times already.  Just waiting for nuances, smiles or waves of the high rollers who sat perched on the riser where the podium stood.  11, 12, 13.  I was getting bored. At least for myself the transition time of each season sticks out among the other marks of the year. Especially fall to winter, more than the others. The morning of the first big snow storm of the year will stick with me through the week. The sun came out for a moment, just a slice and put some light down on those suffering through the long meeting.  Thanks to a cooperative skylight.  <br />I was glad to see the sun, all of us lost in the translation of autumn to the old and unforgivable man that is winter.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-8832346370461461115?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>

The lady I hung out with while she shopped bought a whole sugar cane to make drinks with. I kinda freaked out and thought it was so awesome and acted like the sugar cane was a big bow staff and I was going to fight someone...she didn't really laugh or think it was very funny.

It took us three hours just to leave Delhi.  The freeways to the north were just larger roads, laneless, full and mildly frightening.  15 hours away was Manali, the launch pad to the Himalayas, the greenest, most mysterious and exotic landscape I have ever seen.  It hit me that this little jaunt was actually longer than driving from Salt Lake to the Pacific Ocean.  Before long the cities disappeared, only towns, rice paddies and then villages.  A one night stop in Chandigahr, then through Kullu and evenutally into Manali.  Everything was different up there.  It was like I was in some South-Asian Switzerland.  The drive up was filled with conversations about photography, our assignments, religion, burning-man and everything inbetween.  Bumpty made me try this crazy powder chew so I wouldn't fall asleep that looked like grey drywall dust, only it had a scorpion on the packet (red light #1) and turned my whole mouth deep crimson.  I choked on it and I think there is still some lodged inbetween my throat and nose...probably in my brain by now...lovely. Bumpty bought a grip of Indian CD's and we coursed along.  I just watched the land, the trucks, the truck accidents, the rain the rivers, the bikes the cows, the climbs and tunnells smear by.  We felt like we were driving into the deep green throat of the Himalayas.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-5976464519230501567?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>

One of the best nights yet.<br />If you are curious here are the bands, Laser Fang (SLC), All the Saints (ATL), A Place to Bury Strangers (NY).

    <field name="description"><br /><br />If you can remember those cheesy Family Circus cartoons from way back, there was a single picture with Jeffy's route through the neighborhood and mischief signified by a dotted black line, dipping and rolling up, around and over dozens of situations.  <br />A full day in this city felt like that, I often imagined what my line would look like as I sat with weavers and stitchers in small rooms off of the beaten path or explored back alleys and tall buildings.  There is a electric wave of excitement that seeps through my veins when I realize how hard it would be to find me.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-6418624503355629864?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>

    <field name="title">Pahar Ganj: New Delhi</field>
    <field name="link">http://miketerry.blogspot.com/2009/10/pahar-ganj-new-delhi.html</field>
    <field name="description"><br /><br />When people asked where I was staying, I proudly told them Pahar Ganj, they would smile and nod like they should have guessed.  They were probably fighting the urge to turn me around to check if I had a Lonely Planet sticking out of my back pocket.  It was full of young foreigners, but even fuller of life and an Indian current of activity that could care less who they were temporarily sharing the space with. For two nights I went to the same spot and drank Chai under a darkening purple sky with a group who mutually accepted the foreign break in the ordinary as I leaned onto a windowsill between friends. I sipped and watched shadows skip across blue and green lights, beaming from the back of alcove businesses that line the street and fill the holes of storefronts.  There were layers of activity, business and commerce in the middle of the road and edging the stores, then a soft and fuzzy layer of transient alcohol between the two. <br />As much attention as I would get, being a sweaty pale guy with a camera - there isn't much that could interrupt this pulse of night's seething color, flavor and life as usual.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-3605413747086208725?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>

This fire and those involved, which occurred last week in Ogden, impressed me.<br /><br />I was leaving Ogden, heading down 30th street and the black smoke rising stood out angrily against the blue bird sky.  I drove towards the smoke which was coming from what looked like a backyard or house set within the block.  As I passed the house in the car I saw three men carrying another man up the walkway to the steps of a neighboring home. I had never arrived to the scene of a fire so quickly, there is a different energy there when you beat the fire department that I have never experienced and would be happy if I don't have to again.  I ran up to the group of men and asked if there was anyone else. In all honesty, I can still feel that sick feeling in my stomach as I ran across the grass, I was scared of what I was getting myself into but luckily it was just him who was in the house. I ran back to the car and grabbed my cameras, returning to make a quick photo of his scared and dazed face. I ran back and a neighbor scurried in front of me calling out a name. The three men who carried him  were now speaking to him in broken English; he was missing a dog. Then he said something about wrapping a towel around a heater and caught his breath.<br /><br />I spoke with the three men once the firefighters arrived, they were on their way to work when they saw the smoke and went to see what was up.  They ended up kicking a door in to get to the man. They told me they didn't know the man from Adam and I watched body sized flames lick out of the front door as the man breathed through a clear plastic face mask.  The three were soft spoken and truly did an amazing and brave thing and were probably planning on just heading back to work - only to possibly share the story with a few co workers. I don't think anyone else saw them carrying him, my camera didn't even see it, but I can see it very vividly still. They spoke with a sense of care and reverence for what was avoided, didn't seem like they felt they had done anything extraordinary at all.  Perhaps if they'd seen the picture I missed, if they were rolling by in a car, if they'd seen three others, perhaps they'd realize what they did was pretty impressive and compassionate.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-893136775470413073?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>

I woke up twice today.  Once inside the grey and blue  cabin morning, twice in her car 20 miles south of Rock Springs, morning yellow heating up the pale brown grass that's clenched in messy fists of crunchy snow while a sweet song flows over the radio.  It's almost 8 a.m. and I am on the downslope of a great 48 hours where everything reflected was as close as I hoped.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7844121697889869489-48378792610078370?l=miketerry.blogspot.com" /></div></field>
