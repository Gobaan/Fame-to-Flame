One major limitation
This is a great machine for the price.  I am teaching my teenage daughter to sew and she is turned off by my clunky old Singer.  So I keep that around for the tough jobs and use this new Brother for the light weight stuff.<br /><br />The only major limitation of this machine is that it can't really handle heavy weight fabrics or multiple layers very well.  There is no presser foot adjustment, so the foot can only be raised so much, and can't be adjusted for variable feed, depending on fabric thickness.  There is only one setting.  That means you need to use plenty of pins, and keep the old Singer around for the heavy duty stuff.  Otherwise, a fun little machine.<br /><br />

HOW TO STOP LOWER THREAD LOOPING
I too was having a ton of problems with the lower thread looping under the fabric. It was very frustrating. Finally I figured out how to fix it. Refer to the owner's manual section on inserting the bobbin for photos. What you want to do is drop in the bobbin, and pull the thread through the little slit like it says. But, you have to make sure that the thread goes into the slot in the "tension-adjusting spring" (this is hard to see; pull up the plastic tongue that forms the slit a little with your fingernail to see where it is), although it should go in by itself, then YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE BOBBIN SO IT DOESN'T MOVE AND PULL THE THREAD GENTLY TO SEAT IT INTO THE SPRING. That is the key. After I made sure the thread was all the way in, like magic my lower thread was working perfectly.<br /><br />Aside from that I am happy with the machine. I especially like the needle threader and think that the top thread is very easy to thread. Now that I figured out the lower thread issue, I want to experiment with all the stitches! I wish the presser foot lever was on the back instead of the inside, but oh well. Be careful taking off the tape because I ripped some off and it pulled up a little plastic on the green part of the machine.<br /><br />The owner's manual IS hard to read. The Spanish is right after the English, and sometimes they repeat the same instructions twice, and it's not laid out well. It is manageable, though.<br /><br />They make you think you have to buy special bobbins, but on the box it says you can replace them with class 15, although I have not tried that yet. The accessories seem quite acceptable, except I wish they had given you some ball point needles for knits and stretch rather than just more sharp points.<br /><br />Overall, it sews fine once you get everything threaded right, and I've made several tops already. Definitely good for a beginner or someone who doesn't want to do anything too fancy.

Basic Mechanical Sewing Machine with 25 stitch free-arm sewing
This is your basic mechanical sewing machine. The picture they already show is what you get. It's light weight and easy to use.  It comes with three all purpose needles plus all the extras they list.  I purchased some heavy weight needles for jeans and had no problems sewing them.  It has reverse stitching for locking in the stitch. (Though you do need to hold down the button it's not a problem). <br /><br />   If you just want a mechanical sewing machine that does the job and is affordable this is it.  I use it for hemming; fixing; and sewing curtains and other tasks as they crop up. It has a stitch length dial that is pretty basic.  Also a width dial that mostly positions the needle to the right; center; or left.<br /><br />   Now This machine's foot pedal is tender to the touch I work it in my socks so I can regulate the speed better. Good lighting also.<br /><br />   The only bad I would say about this machine is that the tension dial.  It is picky beyond belief. It takes patience to find the right number or close to one for different sewing material.  I just mark it off so I don't have to look for it again.  Go right to my marks and I'm set to go. ( Took one star off because of this). <br /><br />   Now of course if your a professional seamstress or someone who sews a lot and is looking for perfect stitching you better off with the new computerized sewing machines.  This sews like machines of the past which is no problem for me.  Yes that means occasionally you get tangled in the bobbin area but it never effects my sewing as I'm done by then and just cut out the mess and continue.  Price is good; plus I applied for amazon's credit card which made it approx. a $67 dollar purchase and you can't beat that.

Nice Machine for the Price...
I bought this for my wifes birthday... She has sewn many different things, Rag Quilts, Blankets, Pillow cases...  I have a suit that is fraying around the Button Hole and the machine has the adapter to do button holes.<br />I think it is a great machine for the price... <br />PS. Extremely easy to thread and load the bobbin!

Easy & versatile
About me: I am an absolute beginner and my mother/granny did not sew. I am taking a sewing class and touched a sewing machine for the very first time there. (a 50-year old ELNA). <br /><br />The only reason I am not giving this product a 5 star is because I have only used it for about 3 weeks so far and hence cannot vouch for its reliability long term.<br /><br />Amazon delivered the machine in 3 days - very prompt service. The machine is easily portable and at the same time is not so light that it will trip over when working on an intensive project. Its modern and compact, and yet roomy enough to accommodate your fabric. While not overcrowded with features, it does come in with a handy set of features which will make your sewing experience simple and easy.<br /><br />The manual was fairly good and I was able to set up the machine in about 20 minutes. Winding the bobbin and threading are very easy. Threading the bobbin is extremely simple (this model has the one-step bobbin threading). The storage compartment comes with about 3 types of presser feet, spare needles, spare bobbins and a tool.<br /><br />There are 25 stitches - about 12 are decorative and the remaining are just various types of stitches. There is a needle thread guide which makes threading the needle very simple. The presser foot can just be snapped on and need not be screwed in. <br /><br />The stitches are consistent and nice and machine is easy and efficient to work with. I would definitely recommend this for a beginner.

easy to use
I got this recently. It is very easy to use even though I am an absolute beginner. I've already made 2 handbags with it.<br />Sewing is really simple, and the model has many different types of stitches, for decoration etc.<br />The only thing I haven't been able to work out yet is the embroidery. I am trying to do monogramming. The instructions say that you are supposed to lower the presser bar with the foot removed, but even without the foot, the foot base itself presses onto the fabric making it impossible to move freely. I am wondering if I am supposed to unscrew the foot base, instead of just removing the foot, but something like that is not mentioned in the manual.

Upper Thread Looping
Great basic machine.  I was looking for a replacement for a 60 year-old console, just to do the basics - alterations, repairs and simple projects - and this machine works well for me.<br /><br />Looping...  After a few trial runs, I had a problem with upper thread looping on the underside of the fabric.  It took some time to find the problem: There is a small spring inside the metal thread guide on the top of the machine (threading step 1).  I had more than once missed the spring when threading.  Once I discovered my mistake and made certain that the thread engaged the spring, I had no more problems.

Brother sewing machine
I have had this machine for a few weeks now and I enjoy it.  I find it easy to use though I have only used a few of its features.  I am new to sewing and just do simple things but threading and filling the bobbin were easy and the instructions helpful.

Very pleased with my purchase
After much research and absolutly no experience with sewing I purchased this machine and borrowed a couple of boos from the library: The Everything Sewing Book and Sewing for Dummies. Between the manual and the two books I was completly prepared to make pajama bottoms for the entire family for Christmas. I started with making a pair for myself and being OK with any mistakes and moved on to making the rest with confidence. The only reason I gave the ahine 4 instead of 5 stars is I can not figure out how to use the button hole maker. I spent a good hour reading and re-reading the instructions and doing everything as told and I ended up free styling it with the zig zag stitch. I don't feel too bad about it though because my grnadmother whos being sewing for 50 years can't do it either!
