Jury's still out, but not everything I'd hoped for.
I'm an intermediate beginner.  I have some experience with industrial machines from a sewing class but haven't made any completely successful garments yet.  A more experienced sewer suggested I buy a cheap Brother machine.  I bought this machine in June largely because of the positive reviews it received on Amazon.  Here are the pros and cons I've encountered to date:<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />--Price<br /><br />--Bobbin winding and threading are straightforward (especially the threading function)<br /><br />--Makes a nice stitch so far<br /><br /><br />CONS<br /><br />--The manual is difficult to understand in parts and the layout and index are poor.  It also confusingly includes a Spanish-language version immediately after the English text instead of following the English version at the end, as is usually the case with dual- or multi-language manuals. (Some users over at the Wal-mart site had the same problem.)<br /><br />--The markings on the soleplate don't run the entire length because the feed dogs and bobbin case (on top of the machine) get in the way.  The start of the gauge is fairly far behind the presser foot.<br /><br />--There is no 1/2" marking on the soleplate.  This is a fairly common seam allowance.  I'm going to try to tape it, but I can't simply run a piece of tape across the plate, because, as discussed above, it would cross the feed dog well and the top of the bobbin case.  I also don't know which needle position I'm supposed to mark it from.<br /><br />--The thread spindle can only handle small spools.  To accommodate larger spools I've had to tape chopsticks to the spindle.  I also bought a standalone thread hook to create height and tension, but haven't used it yet.<br /><br />--The needle threader gets in the way. It's not that hard to thread a needle, and this is unnecessary.<br /><br />--Has a somewhat toy-like feel.  But for $114, that's not surprising.<br /><br />--Some of the optional feet are not snap on.<br /><br />--It has a lot of stitches that I don't really have much use for.  All I really want are a reliable and well-formed straight and zigzag stitch.<br /><br />--The numerous dials are confusing and I can't but wonder if so many functions won't make the machine more likely to break down.<br /><br />--An invisible zipper foot is not included.  That would have been much more useful than the accessory feet provided, which I believe are (they aren't labeled, which they should be), a 1/4 quilting foot, a narrow hemmer foot, a quilting foot and a blind stitch foot.<br /><br />--It doesn't come with a carrying case.<br /><br />  <br />Frankly, I'm beginning to wonder if I wouldn't have been better off applying the $100 I spent on this machine towards an entry-level Bernina.  More often than not you get what you pay for and sometimes cheap tools are more costly in the end.<br /><br /><br />Perhaps I will edit this review after a few more months of experience with this machine.<br /><br /><br />

Simple and easy to learn and use.
I'm am enjoying this machine.  I hadn't touched a sewing machine in over 25 years.  This has been so easy - it's like I never stopped sewing!  One thing I have noticed is that it doesn't like heavier fabrics.
