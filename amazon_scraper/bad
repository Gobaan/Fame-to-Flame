Brother Service/Warranty is useless, but Amazon made it right.
I purchased this machine in early January of 2008. It arrived promptly by Amazon, as usual. I used it for a couple of weeks and a little piece of the automatic threader broke off. It took me over a week, counting the Presiden't holiday to get through to the sewing warrantly department at Brother. My options were to go have it serviced (over 100 miles away) or get a box sent and picked up from UPS for service. The issue I have is that they do not replace the machine in the meantime. They also will not extend warranty time frame any longer.<br /><br />I phoned Amazon and they immediately arranged to send a replacement. I have purchased from Amazon for years, this is the first item I've needed to return. They came through.<br /><br />I have purchased from Brother: a monochrome screen word processor, a Brother laptop, 2 Brother laser printers, 1 Brother laser multifunction, 1 Brother fax machine and now this sewing machine. This is the only Brother item I have needed service on. They did not come through. Make sure a repair center is close before you buy this machine.<br /><br />As for the functionality of the machine, it is great for simple sewing. Anything heavier I recommend an industrial quality machine. This one is light which contributes to the poor quality of the materials.

Only for beginners! Not durable
First of all you should know that it's low end machine (mainly sold by discount retailers) from the famous Brother company. <br />The machine has 25 stitch functions and easy to use, but it's plastic moving parts and frame.<br />So it's not durable. My machine broken 2 times during 5 months (both times it was fixed by warranty).  <br />After this I bought good quality middle-end sewing machine from Brothers for $500. <br /><br />Probably it's ok to buy this machine for girl as first sewing machine, <br />but it's not durable enough for often use.
