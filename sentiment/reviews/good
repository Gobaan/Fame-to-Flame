One of the first Atom N450 netbooks
Intel has been gearing up to release the Atom N450 or "Pinetrail" since late last year. The manufacturers had a whole slew of netbooks ready for release between January 4 (when the big electronics show CES opened) and January 11 of 2010 (when it's ok to sell all the new Atom N450 based netbooks). Information was very scarce last year due to a press release embargo and probably the desire to sell of old-stock Atom N270/N280 netbooks.<br /><br />Here is an extremely useful, albeit technical, review of this particular Asus model AND of the Atom N450 on which it is based (if the link gets edited out by Amazon, go to anandtech and search for Asus 1005PE):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Please note that Amazon already has a less expensive Asus, the 1001P, listed on the website, in two versions as well, a more expensive Win 7 Starter edition with 250 gb hard drive and a less expensive Win XP edition [edit: they now both have Win7 Starter, and the 1001p is now an anandtech editors choice - their current netbook favorite!] with 160 gb harddrive:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00322PYXG">ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1001P-PU17-BK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook - Up to 11 Hours of Battery Life</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00322PYUY">ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1001P-MU17-BK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook - Up to 11 Hours of Battery Life</a><br /><br />The main difference is 3 extra hours of battery life, but there may be other feature differences such as wirless n and bluetooth support.<br /><br />I am thinking about getting the Win XP version of the 1001p which is quite a bargain. While Win 7 Starter actually runs quite well on these netbooks, and has a few nice features, Win XP is still slightly faster and less of a resource hog. To get my current Win 7 netbooks to match Win XP, I have to do a lot of adjusting (turning off auto indexing, turning off auto disk defrag, choosing Windows Classic theme instead of Win 7) and Win XP is still slightly faster. My main hope in getting a new N450 netbook would be that elusive grail of netbook owners, decent Hulu and YouTube performance (believe it or not, I can watch DVD's and h.264 high rez content, but not the stinkin' Hulu and YouTube content except at low rez, not-full-screen mode).<br /><br />Early reports are that the N450 has about a 10% performance increase over the last generation Atom netbooks, and a 20% battery life increase, but as always YMMV.<br /><br />THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT things you need to know:<br /><br />1. It's very likely in the next two weeks, netbooks are going to come out with the Broadcom HD chip in them, for $30 extra, which will allow high def output, all the way up to Blue Ray quality, and also an HDMI port to allow easy hookup to your living room tv. This would mean high quality streaming video on an external display. This is probably the single biggest reason to wait.<br /><br />2. Even if high def video isn't important to you, Intel is supposed to be releasing a 1.8 ghz version of the Atom in February or March, and given the cycle of aggressive product adoption and pricing, the extra performance might be worth waiting for.<br /><br />Your budget for one of these, by the way, should be about three duckbills for a basic model like the 1001P and no more than four duckbills for an Atom based netbook with some bells and whistles.<br /><br />And if your machine doesn't come with 2gb of system memory, while single applications run well under Win 7 and two applications run well simultaneously under Win XP, you should budget for an upgrade to the maximum permitted  2gb at some point.<br /><br />Oh by the way, I rummaged around on the Intel website and also found out that the old N270/N280s only support 32 bit Windows but the new N450 supports 64 bit, which is really cool.

Good Little Machine
I purchased this little computer about a week ago and so far it has been great.  So far I have not found anything to complain about with the computer so I will list a few of the things I like:<br /><br />- Even with the extended capacity battery, the computer is very light and portable<br />- The battery life is great!  My daughter watched movies for almost 8 hours on our plane ride home without a hitch or stutter.  After being in use for nearly the entire flight, it still had 35% of the battery remaining.  Another note on the battery, in the earlier 1005 netbooks, the battery would stick out past the screen on the rear of the netbook.  That is no longer the case, on the 1005PE it is flush with the rear of the netbook.<br />- The keyboard is nice and decent size.  I almost bought a Toshiba solely because I did not like the keyboard on the 1005HA version of this machine.  Asus changed the keyboard on this model to a chiclet keyboard which is much better.  I saw one review that thought the keyboard was flimsy.  As far as I can tell, the Asus has no more flexibility in the keyboard than the Acer or Toshiba netbooks I looked at.<br />- Windows 7 starter and Asus Utility.  I saw a few reviews where people complained about Win7 Starter.  Again, so far no problems with the OS, it does what it is intended to do.  As far as the complaints about changing the background on the desktop, Asus was kind enough to provide a utility that makes changing the background very easy.<br />- WLAN - since I bought the netbook, it has been in 6 locations that have wireless internet and it has jumped on the network easily each time regardless on encryption.<br /><br />A couple more thoughts on netbooks in general:<br />- Netbooks are not desktop replacements or miniture laptops. They are intended to provide basic computing and internet needs.  If you are expecting it to fly through huge power point presentations or apps that require a lot of RAM and processing power you will be disappointed.  If all you need is a computer that travels easily and will allow you to surf the web, play music and video and run office programs, netbooks can be a very good choice.  <br />- I would recommend that anyone who buys a netbook remove as much of the installed software as they can.  I was able to remove alot of pre-loaded junk and the netbook ran faster.  Here are a few program that I think every netbook should have:  Firefox or Google Chrome for internet, vlc (Videolan) for music and movie playback, Open Office 3 for word processing, spreadsheets, etc and Foxit Reader for opening .pdf files.<br /> Also, I have seen several recommendations to replace the 1GB Ram with a 2GB stick.  I have not done this yet and it still works great.  At the moment I have a 4GB SD card installed to see if there are any performance gains using the Windows Reafyboost function.  So far so good.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this netbook has exceeded my expectations and is a solid little machine.  I would recommend it to anyone in search of a good netbook.  <br />

Glad I didn't wait for the iPad from Apple...
I wanted to wait to write this review until after the new iPad from Apple was released today to see how they compared. I'm glad I didn't wait to buy the 1005PE from Asus! So far I'm very happy with all of the same things the rest of the reviewers are happy with- and kinda bummed about the same things the others are bummed about. (Fingerprints)<br /><br />This netbook is basically an upgrade to my 32GB iPod Touch that sits on my bedside table. I used to use the Touch for web surfing and media viewing, but now I have this awesome little netbook that does everything the iPod Touch did for me, plus it has a ton more storage (250GB compared to 32GB) 13-ish hour battery life (compared to 3-5 on the Touch) and it supports Adobe's flash standard! (Something even the new iPad from Apple doesn't seem to do...) All in all, I'm very pleased with the 1005PE and have zero regrets following the unveiling of the new iPad from Apple today. I'm sure the 1005PE isn't a perfect replacement for the iPad to ALL users, but for me, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.<br /><br />One thing to note- as already reported- you want to get the 800 MHz RAM upgrade from Crucial, not the 667 MHz that Amazon lists on the 1005PE product page. I did the upgrade and noticed that things are even snappier- but the 1GB RAM module that came out of the 1005PE was 800 MHz memory- not 667 MHz... <br /><br />For the person who gave this netbook one star because he couldn't get greater than 1024 x 768 external VGA output while mirroring the internal monitor, that's pretty weak in my opinion. Considering all of the other features that this netbook provides for such little cost- I think this netbook is a real winner! Thanks for reading my review!

Excellent machine!
Okay, since I am a college business major who doesn't know a great deal about computers, here's my 2 cents:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Superb battery life: got 13 hours out of writing research papers on Word, generating excel reports, checking stocks, reading WSJ, managing portfolios, and etc.<br />2. Chiclet keyboard feels great to type on<br />3. Screen is bright enough<br />4. Sound quality is great comparing to other netbooks<br />5. Windows 7 runs pretty fast in my opinion<br />6. YOUTUBE & HULU VIDEOS RUN EXTREMELY SMOOTH! (not in HQ of course)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Hate the glossy screen (there goes my eyesight)<br />2. Chiclet keyboard is a little loud comparing with the one on 1005HA<br />3. 6-cell battery can be somewhat heavy for the girls<br />4. Two-finger scrolling did not work for me, so I had to install an additional driver. URGH!<br /><br />Bottom of the line, the Asus 1005PE is still the best on the market as of now.

Excellent on the battery life!
Got this for the long battery life. It really does get most of the advertised 14 hours. Got about 11 hours with wireless access during most of that time, a fair amount of work on the machines, and there was still a tiny bit of battery life left. So I'd say the numbers (14 hours would reflect less work and less wireless use) are not too far off. The machine is very sleek, somewhat heavy for its size (the battery probably makes up a good deal of the weight gain), and the Windows 7 is usable. I'd say that it was a good package if battery life were near the top of your desire list.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Genuinely good battery life<br />- Works fine, hardware & software<br />- Looks good, especially the display<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Slightly heavy for the size and definitely heavier than some other netbooks<br />- Windows 7 "Starter" edition, if that matters to you<br />- Probably would run faster with more memory standard

A Great Buy
In Brief: <br />This netbook provides stellar battery life, admirable performance, and is priced very competitively.<br /><br />Me as a user:<br />I'm a Technology & Management consultant, who is now attending grad school for a PhD. My classes are three-hours long a piece and my 17" laptop was going to be too heavy and cumbersome to lug around campus, not to mention having to plug in for every class. <br /><br />I was looking for netbook primarily to take notes and do some light web-work (DreamWeaver and Expression Web). <br /><br />Keyboard & Touchpad:<br />I have large hands so my biggest concern with a netbook was being able to type quickly and comfortably. The keyboard, despite smaller but more spaced out keys (compared to say the HP Minis), was easy to use and I was able to type with no adjustment to my usual habits.  The keys also have a nice tactile feel, unlike the more floating feeling on, again, the HP Mini.<br /><br />As is a complaint of big reviews like those on CNET, the rocker-bar mouse-buttons is a little stiff, but not the end of the world - I think it may ease up after some use.<br /><br />Performance:<br />The initial startup, which involved Windows 7 initializing the installation, took around 10-15-minutes - so don't expect to turn it on and hit the desktop right away.<br /><br />From power-on to the Windows desktop, takes about 25-30 seconds.  <br /><br />Overall responsiveness from the desktop and launching applications was quick.  After installing Office 2007 Pro, Word took about 6-seconds to load the first time, and was about 2-3 seconds to load after that. Chrome is very quick to load; browsing and overall network performance is very good.<br /><br />Media:<br />Steaming video, like Hulu, is a big test for a lot of netbooks - this model can play full screen videos with only an occasional stutter or slow-down - I tested an episode of The Daily Show. Local video files (played off a USB flash drive) played without issue. <br /><br />The speaker volume is loud enough to hear in an open room with some background noise, but not in a crowded hall.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />I debated a lot between this model and the HP Mini 311 with nVidia ION for better performance at the cost of battery life. I can say that so far I feel that I made the right choice, since the HP Mini would have cost around 100.00 more for the configuration with matching N-Wifi, BlueTooth, and Windows 7 - which comes on this netbook.<br /><br />I highly recommend the ASUS Eee PC 1005PE.

Memory upgrade - 800 MHz not 667 MHz
Great Netbook!<br /><br />Careful with the memory upgrade.  The 667 MHz 2GB module mentioned on this page is not suitable for the 1005PE - mine kept freezing.  Instead, order the 800 MHz module, Amazon # (ASIN): B001342KM8

The PERFECT netbook, returned the Toshiba NB305 and bought this instead ... NO REGRETS
I ordered the Toshiba NB305 and returned it to get this instead. I have NO REGRETS and am VERY SATISFIED with my purchase.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Battery life is amazing. Even on the highest settings, I can get around 9 hours. Unmatched.<br />- Keyboard. I returned the Toshiba NB305 due to its weird keyboard. This has one of the BEST keyboards I've typed on. It's chiclet style and perfect for touch typists because the keys are in the right place unlike the Toshiba. The keys are obviously a bit smaller. They feel good, and they're responsive. This is the MAIN reason I decided to keep this netbook.<br />- Sound. Netbooks should not be used without earphones but if you must use the speakers, these are LOUD. The Toshiba NB305 had almost no sound so this is a huge improvement.<br />- Price. This is $40 cheaper than the Toshiba NB305.<br />- Weight. This is lighter than the Toshiba NB305.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Screen is dimmer than the Toshiba NB305 but after a while I didn't notice. Plus, I think it saves more battery life and it is STILL bright.<br />- TOUCHPAD BUTTON!! Instead of two designated touchpad buttons, there's this touchpad bar thing and it's VERY stiff. I do not like using it and it really tires my fingers out. I wish ASUS would make two designated touchpad buttons.<br />- FINGERPRINT MAGNET. One of the things I liked about the Toshiba NB305 was its impeccable looks. This ASUS will not draw any looks because the blue and black are really plain but I can't deny its functionality. I wish ASUS would add more colors to its line.

Excellent Netbook Options For The Price
When it comes to notebooks I normally purchase Dells. However, when I found I needed a netbook for taking notes in class and I began to look at the different models, the Dell Mini battery life just wasn't that good and the ASUS caught my attention for several reasons. One of the students in class had one and he really liked it. When I looked online the price, options and customer reviews were excellent, so I decided to take a chance on it and it has been great. Below are some of the Pro's and (few) Con's:<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Price: A lot of machine for the price. When looking at the Dell and Sony models they cost more with fewer options<br /><br />Monitor: Excellent, crisp LED backed 1024x600 display with minimal reflection<br /><br />Bluetooth: Actually has built in Bluetooth which is not common on other Netbooks<br /><br />Wireless: 802.11b/g/n with excellent reception and connects without problems<br /><br />Windows 7 Starter: I was very surprised it boots up and shuts down very fast and uses minimal resources<br /><br />Built in Web Cam and Mic: Although the webcam has become standard, I was surprised that it included a mic<br /><br />USB Ports: This netbook surprisingly has three USB ports built in!<br /><br />Keyboard Layout: Takes a little getting used to since it's obviously not full size, but the layout is very good<br /><br />Battery Life: EXCELLENT. Running Windows and MS Works for 3.5 hours while taking notes I only used 22% of battery so it has very good power management. In addition, the ASUS Super Hybrid Engine auto-adjusts power settings to get maximum life out of the battery. For example, if you're not touching the computer for more than a minute the computer starts stepping down the brightness of the display to prolong the battery life. If you are just looking to surf the web then you can just boot into the ASUS non-Windows environment which will make your battery life last even longer.<br /><br />Hard Drive: A lot of netbooks are coming with only 160GB hard drives. This one has 250GB which is really a bonus.<br /><br />Integrated Flash Card Slot: MMC/SD/SDHC<br /><br />Built-in Recovery: Comes preloaded with an image of the system that the user can use to reload the netbook should the computer become infected or if they simply want to do a fresh install. A recovery DVD is included as well. <br /><br />Con's: <br />Exterior Finish: I love the blue color, but the shinny finish picks up fingerprints easily. In addition, it scratches very easily as well. For me it's not too big of an issues, but I know it could be for others.<br /><br />Memory: Only comes with 1GB of Ram as do most netbooks. The netbook seems to run okay, but I noticed a speed improvement when I upgraded to the 2GB. If you are thinking of upgrading the memory see my WARNING below.<br /><br />Pre-Installed Software: It comes with trials of Micro Trends AV and Office 2007. I deleted all of that crap off of the machine. If you're planning on using it great, but otherwise I would get rid of it as it takes up memory and hard drive space.<br /><br />DVD Drive: This isn't necessarily a con, but I wanted to mention it for users who may want to load software from a CD or DVD that it doesn't have one. I purchased an external drive for this.<br /><br />MEMORY UPGRADE WARNING: I upgraded my memory to the maximum 2GB. There are two things to be aware of:<br /><br />1. Amazon has listed on the page for this netbook a memory module under the Frequently Bought Together section on the page that is the INCORRECT memory type for this computer. Do not buy the 256Mx64PC2-5300 module, the correct memory is 6400 and not 5300.<br /><br />2. I normally upgrade my computers with Crucial Memory. To ensure I was purchasing the correct memory I went out to Crucial's website and ran their memory finder using my computer model. The module the Crucial website told me to purchase was CT25664AC800 2GB 200-pin SODIMM DDR2 PC2-6400 which I purchased from Amazon. This memory module is INCOMPATIBLE with this machine. Users across the web have been reporting different issues. The problem I was encountering was the computer screen would sometimes come up black on startup. It would also sometimes show the boot process on the screen at startup which is not normal. The big problem is that when the machine is operating on battery power it would not shut down completely. The Windows program would close and the screen would go dark, but the power lights remained on along with the fan sometimes staying on. The only way around this shut down problem was to shut down the ASUS Super Hybrid Engine software first and then shutdown the machine or press and hold the power button, neither of which I was willing to do. Let me mention this is NOT a software issue with the ASUS Super Hybrid Engine but an incompatibility with the memory. After searching multiple forums I found a user who had purchased Corsair Memory VS2GSDS800D2 2 GB PC2-6400 800MHz 200-pin DDR2 SODIMM and used it with success. I ordered the new memory from Amazon and it works well and there are no longer any issues with startup or shut downs.<br /><br />One last thought. If you are looking at this netbook as a replacement to a notebook or desktop then think twice about it. Don't get me wrong, this is a great little netbook and it does a great job for me, but my primary reasons for getting this was to take notes in class, stay up on email and do web surfing. Essentially I wanted something that could keep me connected to the world with long battery life, but without the weight and bulk of a notebook/laptop. If you want to do more than the basic stuff then you probably need to be looking at a different type of machine instead of a netbook.<br />

Great netbook, glad I bought it!
I was wavering between the EEE PC 1005 HA and  Toshiba NB205-N325 Netbook and had pretty much settled on the Toshiba as it had the new Atom processor when I realized there was a new Asus out. This has a bigger hard disk and also didn't have a battery that stuck out in the back like on the Toshiba and that pretty much settled it. I did not get exctra RAM and I am pretty happy without it, I just put in a SD card and enabled The ReadyBoost feature in Windows 7 and that makes an amazing difference. I would have preferred a matte finish, so only issue is you need a wipe cloth handy for all those fingerprints you end up leaving on it. Love it otherwise.

Slight but welcomed upgrade to my old 1005HA
I purchased the 1005PE-PU to replace the 1005HA I gave to a family member.  I think my entire family will have netbooks before I'm done buying the latest and greatest.  lol This time, I wanted to have a netbook that ships with Windows 7 since I have that install on our desktops.  The extra battery life is just a nice bonus.<br /><br />You may be inclined to get the 1005PE-MU with less battery life.  Consider getting the 1005PE-PU instead.  I think the extra battery life comes in handy if you prefer to keep the netbook running in high performance mode with wifi on.  The 1005PE-PUalso comes with Bluetooth.  You can use this to connect your netbook to your Bluetooth cell phone and surf the web.  The extra battery life really comes in handy if u run your netbook all day with your cell phone draining the battery a bt via USB.  Seems like a good deal for only a couple dollars more.<br /><br />Regarding the 667 versus 800 memory question, I used the 667 module in my 1005HA.  Based on what I've read on the web, I ordered the 800 MHz model for my 1005p.  They cost about the same these days.  Just hold on to your packaging and receipt if you have problems.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001342KM8?ie=UTF8&tag=pc-accessories-10-20&creativeASIN=B001342KM8<br /><br />This netbooks does not come with a DVD drive so consider getting a cheap external one.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U02JZ8?ie=UTF8&tag=pc-accessories-10-20&creativeASIN=B001U02JZ8<br /><br />If you are considering the old and cheaper 1005HA, one nice thing it has is a full size right shift key.  It's still a good machine if you don't mind XP (you can upgrade it to win7 later).<br /><br />UPDATE 3/20/2010<br /><br />If you dont need a unit right away, Asus will be releasing the 1018P, 1016P and 1015P soon.  Don't know the specs but it might be worth it to wait.

Just what I wanted!! Wonderful little computer!
I came into the market with a goal of finding a netbook that was very portable had great battery life, and was comfortable for extended periods of time. Mainly I wanted one I could use for web-browsing and screenwriting. This little guy lived up to all my expectations.<br /><br />I was very concerned about a few things at first:<br />-The glossy screen<br />-The keyboard/mouse<br />-Windows 7 starter<br /><br />The screen actually is great. I was super worried about glare but it hasn't been a problem, it's bright, clear and even though its smaller then laptops its still a great size. You can zoom in very easily, and I've found the best way to make use of the available screen space is to set the Taskbar to auto-hide and then use Google Chrome as a browser, because it takes up even less space than FireFox.<br /><br />The keyboard's fantastic, expecially the chicklet style layout of the keys, feels great and not cluttered. The mouse is good, once you get used to the surface its fine and I love the multi-touch functions so that you can scroll, zoom, and flip pages with it. The click bar isnt the best, but its not bad either, i wish it was slightly bigger, but oh well. I've typed on it for long periods of time and it feels good, and doesnt hurt my hands.<br /><br />Windows 7 has been superb! I love the look of it, the feel, its very responsive and much more fun to work in than XP. I was very worried because i know Starter Edition doesn't allow you to change your desktop background, well don't worry! Asus includes a wonderful program that takes care of a few things for you, and this includes allowing you to change your wallpaper, you can even make it into a slideshow so it will shuffle through multiple backgrounds at whatever interval you set it to shuffle at. The new features are nice though it doesn't have the seethrough aspect that premium does, nor does it show thumbnail previews on the taskbar, but for what im using the netbook for, it functions just great.<br /><br />Other notable things I love are:<br />- BATTERY!!!<br />- Speakers<br />- Weight<br /><br />The battery is amaaaaazing. Im so glad i got the long lasting one. I've never tried testing out how long it goes for, but its such a thrill to have it sitting on my lap and still know theres 6 hours left on it when it hasnt been charged all day. I can close the lid and leave it unplugged for days only to pick it up and still have hours and hours left on it :)<br />Not once have I had to worry about running out of juice while im on the go.<br /><br />I was worried the speakers might not be powerful enough but I haven't had a problem with them at all.<br /><br />And finally the size and weight it perfect, i was reallllly debating for a while about going with a 10,11, or 12 inch, and I'm glad i went with the 10, anything bigger is bordering on laptop territory and this size just feels right, its not too thick or heavy, it feels light and compact and easy to just grab and go which is exactly what you should be looking for a in a netbook. Overall I'm super happy with my choice!

Memory upgrade - Crucial CT1166735
I recently got my ASUS Eee PC 1005PE and am happy with it.   I planned to upgrade to 2GB and ordered the Crucial CT25664AC800 as was recommended in some reviews.   However, some people have had trouble with this.<br /><br />Crucial now has a recommendation for the ASUS 1005PE: the 2GB CT1166735, which appears to have the same specifications as the CT25664AC800.   The Crucial site doesn't appear to be working quite right because it says there are four possible products which can be used, but only shows the one.   Further, the Crucial program which scans your computer and makes upgrade recommendations didn't run on the ASUS -- a Win 7 issue?<br /><br />Searching the Crucial site for CT25664AC800 gives the surprising result that there are FIVE versions of this ram module by different manufacturers - two from Intel, two from Diamond Flower, and one from MSI.   It's possible to order a particular kind of CT25664AC800 from Crucial or just place a generic order.   Perhaps the inconsistent results people have with the CT25664AC800 are due to different implementations of it.<br /><br />I plan to return the unopened CT25664AC800 that I received from Amazon as it does not appear to be the recommended Crucial memory, although the specifications are identical to the Crucial CT1166735.   The CT1166735 is apparently only manufactured by one supplier and the ASUS 1005PE is mentioned explicitly in its description.

I Love This Netbook!
I had initial reservations about going from a full sized, full featured laptop to a net book.  Since I've retired my computer needs have changed and I thought a net book could be a good fit for me now.  I did much research and online shopping.  My main requirement was battery life.  I wanted something I could use unplugged for an entire day when necessary. I have been using laptops since they came out and have always been disappointed by having to plug them in after a couple of hours.<br />After the initial charge the first day, I used the computer as I normally would and 15 hours later I plugged it in so I could go to bed.  It was still at 10% power!  It has performed likewise everyday for over a month, I unplug it in the morning and plug it in at bedtime.  It only takes about three hours to charge. <br /> <br />The computer is very well built and speaks quality in every way. The monitor is clear and bright.  The keyboard is stated to be 92% regular size, but fits my hands better than my last laptop and I find it easier to use. The wi-fi is easy and fast to set up and picks up any network close by with no trouble. The 250G hard drive is larger than any I've had on previous laptops.<br /><br />I cannot think of anything negative to say at this point. It's all I want or need in a laptop at this time. After six laptops I've finally got one that's truly portable and can travel with me.  I couldn't be happier. I LOVE It!<br />p.s. Amazon had the very best price on the very latest model.

Great Netbook, even better battery life!
This little netbook is great. Its like it's the perfect size! <br /><br />The battery life is amazing, even on the super performance mode. You can probably get 6 hours of video play on this thing!<br /><br />The keyboard is almost full size, but still takes a little bit of getting used to. The middle of the keyboard has kind of a pingy/cheap sound/feel to it, but overall its fine.<br /><br />The webcam is ok. Its only 0.3 megapixel so its a little grainy, but for routine Skype use it works fine. <br /><br />I like the charger and cord. They come with little velcro straps and they are long yet compact. The charger connects to the netbook on the side near the back. The connector is very small and does not stick out much to minimize being banged and damaged. <br /><br />The glossy surface is not a big deal to me. People complain about it being a fingerprint magnet. Who cares? Just have a cloth nearby and wipe it off once in a while! Again, not a biggie IMHO.<br /><br />The trackpad works fine. My other laptop has a scroll up/down feature which is really nice. This netbook does not have that feature fyi... The trackpad works by tapping or with the use of the toggle button. What you'll find with the trackpad button is that it is quite stiff, which is another common complaint on these reviews. <br /><br />Windows 7 starter is kind of crappy. You can't play movies on it unless you download VLC player, and I don't like VLC player. you can't change the desktop background or use the nice aero feature on Win 7 either. It feels like a cheap knock off copy of the real thing. When you find out you can't do this and you can't do that, you feel kind of cheated. I upgraded to Win 7 Home Premium and I'm very happy with it. <br /><br />Overall this is a great product especially if you want it for school or you travel a lot. The battery life is great and was definitely the selling feature for me. I would recommend getting the $50 CD/DVD player/burner along with it so you can watch DVD's and install hard copy programs.

ASUS Seashell just right...
I purchased the ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE-PU17-BK for my Wife.  She wanted a light weight small unit that she could do email and Facebook on basically. I'm the computer geek, so I was looking for a nice viewing screen, good feel on the keyboard, good price and features, but most of all GREAT battery life.  This unit had just hit the streets with a new processor that claimed up to 14 hours of battery life. Overall it fulfilled both our needs and wants.  And because it is a netbook, it fits inside most of my wife's purses. The keyboard has a decent feel if you are a touch typist and seems a bit larger than some netbook keyboards.  The trackpad is the same black color and therefore blends in with the surrounding area, but is easy to detect because it is covered with very tiny "bumps". ASUS says that its' quick startup and long battery life is also because it uses Windows 7 Starter. The battery life is pretty right on when doing email and basic surfing the internet.  Of course, if you are doing video or light weight gaming, it will fall off but will still surprise you.  Remember it does not have a built-in CD or DVD drive. I purchased the ASUS external DVD Writer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U02JZ8">ASUS USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive SDRW-08D1S-U (Black)</a>. It works great...and does not have a power plug or "brick". Its' power comes straight from this netbook. It comes with a two headed USB plug that connects directly to the side-by-side USB ports on the ASUS Seashell. The two connections allow it enough power to function properly. One other thing to know is that this unit is black, GLOSS BLACK! NICE! But that means that you will see EVERY finger print and smudge. ASUS does include a small microfiber towel and it does get plenty of use.

Best netbook out there
This ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE truly offers a 14 hour long battery charge. I was amazed that it took hours to loss charge instead of a few short hours. Most laptops only lasts a maximum of three hours and don't take long to have to be put to charge. This netbook also offers a performance shortcut profile that makes a difference. Windows 7 works wonderfully on this netbook. The start up takes seconds instead of minutes. Portability is truly a bliss to have and this netbook offers it magnificently.

Everything you were looking for in a netbook - and more!
The ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE-PU17BK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook I ordered from Amazon 2 months ago arrived with lightening-like speed and in perfect condition.  I unpacked it at lunch time, plugged it in and waited a day and a half to power it up for the first time.  It works great.  Windows 7 (Starter Edition) is a breeze to operate.  (No need to upgrade - the Starter Edition does everything I expected it to.)  In no time, I was hooked up to my home wifi and surfing the internet.  It was just as easy to use the separate CD reader I purchased (also from Amazon) to load a program I had on CD.  (I chose a CD reader only - very inexpensive)  I loaded another important program over my wifi with no problem.  The keyboard is almost full-size and has a good feel to it.  The touch-pad mouse took just a little time to get used to, but is now like second nature to me.  I did not buy the extra memory and probably won't.  This little netbook runs great for internet use and for word processing just the way it is.  I've had only one frustration so far - I'm having a problem with my free trial of Microsoft Office Home Edition.  I can't find an unlock code and Microsoft wants me to download a whole new program to do a much shorter trial.  I bought a memory-foam case with separte pouch for the transformer/plug.  The whole outfit weighs less than 3 pounds!  Now that's portability!!  I've saved the best for last - the battery really does last 14 hours!!!  As I mentioned before, my use is mostly word processing.  It takes several full evenings of use to run the battery down.<br /><br />In summary, it works great right out of the box.  Portable, super-long battery life, good keyboard and mouse, and speedy.  Even Windows 7 Starter is a winner!<br /><br />Signed,<br />Happy Customer

Fantastic netbook
Pro's: N450 processor, wonderful screen, of course 1G memory was ok but after adding a 2G's of memory it works wonderfully.. Out of the box the Super Hybrid engine software does a great job setting power management setting to save battery.. On auto saver perfect balance to get the true 14 hrs of runtime, however playing video (dvd, stream) does not work very well.. after very minor tweaks to the user friendly video card settings the battery life does drop slightly, but you get excellent video.. <br /><br />Con's: Bloat-ware... can't any manufacturer put just the software that is needed on their hardware and nothing more??  It took me 3 hours to remove all the crap software.. Mouse pad is nice design but i'm not sure if Asus or if Synaptics is trying to make the mouse pad do to many different things. Had to disable so many different options to get an efficently working mouse pad.. <br /><br />Overall: The Asus 1005PE-PU17 is a fantastic machine for the cost... With some changes to the software side of things and minor changes/tweaks to the power management the 1005PE-PU17 is a wonderful everyday worker.. Just remember to add 2G memory stick and clean bloat ware off..

Perfect for Netflix
I originally bought this netbook for just surfing the web, email and other basic tasks. But soon found out that it works great for watching instant movies on netflix. The shows look perfect on the 10 inch screen, and the video quality is excellent once the movies buffer after a few minutes. I was home sick the for a few days and I was getting at least 7-8 hrs of continuous use on battery in the high performance mode while watching shows. I get about 12-14hrs when doing general web surfing and emailing in power saver mode. I've had this Netbook for over a month and I have to say I am very impressed with this little computer. It has totally replaced my Ipod Touch for portable media viewing.

Asus speed
I bought an Asus 1005PE Netbook on my way to the airport for a business trip to Spain.  I was truly disappointed with the speed of the device while surfing or checking email.  I found that if I opened more then 2 Windows Internet Explorer pages the 1 gig of ram the box came with was spent.  I was tempted to purchase a 2 GB stick but it cost the equivalent of 85 US dollars in Spain.  A friend told me to download Mozilla Firefox for Internet browsing and it made the Netbook act like a brand-new machine that I could open multiple Internet pages and stream video without any problems.  I have since replaced the 1GB memory with a 2Gb ($42) but haven't noticed much difference due to the speed obtained with dumping MSExplorer.  Bottom line, download Mozilla Firefox!<br />Peace!<br />

Practically perfect
I'm far from being a "techie," but within a few minutes of removing this item from the box, plugging it into the wall, and attaching an ordinary coaxial cable, I was commander of a media empire (with nary a glance at the instruction manual).  First of all, this thing is remarkably light, compact, and transportable.  Even though it was delegated to replace the aging Emerson 13" TV in our kitchen, I can't think of anything I would rather take with me to another room, my desk, or on a trip.  As is the case with any flat LCD screen, it doesn't "play" as large as its cathode ray equivalent.  (For example, If you want to experience the effect of your old 27" big tube TV, you'll need a 37" LCD display--not just because of aspect ratio but the brighter, more intense, life-like quality that is unique to the "picture-tube" television sets of yore.)  So given the shallow profile of this baby, don't be surprised if you find yourself second-guessing whether or not you should have sprung for the 19"-20" model.<br /><br />Nevertheless, once you've lit up this little Toshiba, chances are you won't want to let it out of your sight.  It doesn't have HDMI inputs--just coax, S-Video, and 3-color component video.  Yet with a screen this small, clarity and brightness are never an issue.  Even with an ordinary coax connection, the images are as crisp and sharply defined as the "enhanced" HD signals at a Best Buy or Sears TV department, the colors are vivid yet complex (just be sure to set it in permanent "Movie" mode--all of the other settings push contrast at the expense of hues and colors).<br /><br />I have a big Sony flat screen that takes me several minutes to locate the switches, adjust the TV menu, then the set-top box, and by the time I find my way through the plethora of Time-Warner channels, I've missed the opening skit to SNL. The Toshiba<br />The audio is acceptable for dialog.  There's no distortion or "canned" quality, though for listening to Bernard Herrmann's score to "Vertigo" (the first DVD I fed the machine), I might give some consideration to using audio "out" for headphones or a hi-fi system.   For most purposes, the sound is just fine.  The remote, moreover, is bigger and friendlier than those coming with sets costing 5-10 times as much (yet this is one set for which the remote is an unneeded luxury).  And I find the channel changes to be relatively quick for an LCD hi def processor.<br /><br />In sum, simplicity, practicality, price and state-of-the-art technology tell me this is a "gadget" to own--if only because it behaves less like a gadget than a utilitarian necessity.  Just remember to set it in "move mode" (I know, too yellow on most HD sets), which seems like the perfect setting for all program types on this baby.

Perfect set for our camper
We purchased this combination TV and DVD player for our 17' Casita travel trailer.  So far, we've only used it in the DVD mode since we camped in remote sites where we do not get TV signals (we do not have satellite capability with our trailer...so unless there is a cable hookup where we camp, the DVD player is our main use).  We DID try out the TV with our cable connection in the house before placing it in the trailer and we were happy with the picture and sound it produced.  As far as the trailer, we particularly like this 15.6" set because it draws a mere 30 watts which is less than 1/2 the power of the prior 13" LCD set we used with a separate DVD player.  We like the widescreen since this is the mode most often used on DVDs produced now and by using less watts, we can watch more movies without using up our battery power and having to recharge with the generator.

Great TV/DVD Combination
This LCD TV/DVD combination is perfect for the kitchen counter.  All features including TV resolution, DVD picture and sound quality and CD sound checked out as excellent.  The only minor complaint is when pressing a selection with the remote resting on a surface, rather than being held in the hand, the unbalanced design of the remote tends to allow it to tip over to one side. I highly recommend this product for the compact design and versatility of features.

Toshiba 15in HDTV/DVD
This Toshiba 15in TV/DVD combo was a replacement for a small kitchen TV that was a number of years old and just received over air channels. After connecting a HDTV over air Antenna to the Toshiba...I was able to receive a number of sharp and crisp HDTV channels with great sound. The DVD player was easy to use with a great picture. I was concern that this TV/DVD combo<br />would be too large for the space I had in the kitchen...but it has worked out FINE.<br /><br />

Toshiba 15.6 Inch is a great little TV for our camper.
We were looking for a small unit for our camping trailer and the built in DVD player made it a perfect fit.  I was surprised to find it also had an amazing picture with good color. The only negative for us is that it didn't have a way to mount it to the wall...only a stand.  But for most people this is all they need. It's very light and easy to handle. It was a perfect buy. We even accidentally knocked it over and it came crashing down and hit the screen on the edge of the counter....no damage at all....we were impressed.

Awesome
I purchased this TV from Amazon to use in my Travel Trailer since the old TV would not work due to the switch to digital.  I was very surprised when I performed auto program and it found 29 digital and 2 analog channels, some more than 30 miles away.  In the same location with the old analog signal I could only receive 5 stations (some fuzzy) at the most.<br /><br />I also purchased a powered table antenna but found out it wasn't needed because the trailer antenna worked as well or better.<br /><br />The set has excellent sound and the picture is very clear with bright colors.  The remote is easy to use and you only press one button to go from TV to DVD.<br /><br />This set is ideal for using around the house, RV, or any place you have ac to power the unit. <br /><br />

Toshiba 15LV505 TV
We're very pleased with this Toshiba TV.  In searching for a small TV for my wife for her kitchen viewing, I found most of the under-cabinet/over-counter TV's were cheaply made and unimpressive.  This TV has excellent clarity, well-made - and she loves it.

HDTV writ small
This is a great little TV for the kitchen. I replaced our old one because my spouse, who only watched TV in the kitchen, kept bugging me for a high def TV. She thought she wanted a great big one, so I had to remind her that she does not WATCH TV (except in the kitchen). So I got what I wanted (no unjustified cost) and she got what she wanted ( a high-def TV)! It arrived fine and quickly. Price was right.

Beautiful picture--Great service--Update:  Great Sound too!
I just got this today.  BEAUTIFUL picture, but when you get it, check which picture type it is set on.  I noticed that writing on screen in a newscast was blurry and couldn't figure out why.  Turns out it was on the Sports setting.  Once I changed that and changed my Dish box to 720 vs 1080, everything cleared up.  I can't say enough about the picture--I replaced a Sylvania 15-inch HDTV that I've had for a year or so.  It had a pretty lousy picture quality. Haven't tried out the DVD player yet, but hoping it will be as good.  I got a great deal (I think) at under $200.  The only thing that is not perfect is that the stand--it is static and can't be tilted back or turned side to side.  But once I got the TV into a good position for viewing that wasn't a terrible problem.  The supplier sent it free 2-day shipping/no tax--although it wasn't Amazon but a 3rd party (Electronic Express).  GREAT service!!  I'll tell you that after days and days of snow and being stuck inside this TV is the best thing that has happened in days!! I did feel bad for the FedEx driver though...<br /><br />Edited to add that after having used this TV for a while, I am wondering why all the comments about the sound.  The sound on mine is great and can be heard easily even when the dishwasher is running.  In fact, I find myself turning the sound down often.  Secondly, I finally made use of the DVD player to watch Julie&Julia.  EXCELLENT!!  Easy to use--push a button to switch from TV to DVD, pop in the DVD and off we go.  I have also found that the immobile stand is not a problem. When I need a different angle, I just turn the TV in the viewing direction.  Easy as pie.  I think this is one super unit all the way around and am upping my rating to 5 Stars.

Toshiba 15LV505
Bought this Toshiba on Amazon for my bedroom.  I have been very happy with it.  I looked at other smaller TV's and found the sound systems to be inferior; some had to be turned up all the way.  I love this Toshiba because I can adjust the treble and bass, it sounds great. The picture is sharp clear and colorful.  <br />I had some trouble trying to get "rabbit" ears to work, but took both of them back.  I have resorted to cable (basic) without any box.  It pulls them in easily.  I was too hasty in channel search, but found that it takes time to adjust each station ~ but after it settles down, I discovered that I can get LOTS more programs.  4 isn't just 4, but you can get 40101, 40102, 40103 etc... on several of the stations.  As a result I can view most things ( not CNN ) but I can live without that.   Would highly recommend it to anyone.  You can adjust the size of the screen to be "traditional" or Wide or Theatre, etc.... and the closed caption is great as well.  I have a long cord with headphones and it doesn't disturb anyone else if needed.  The volume can be set to 1 or 2 with it, and it is plently loud. <br />

I was concerned about all the 1 star reviews....
Until I remembered that most people are idiots... This is not a 1 Star Drive... this is a 5 Star Drive.<br /><br />If you read the one star reviews, you will find that most people who wrote them are bothered by the Western Digital Smartware Software. Let me be perfectly clear. The Western Digital Software is NOT removable without a hardware hack, but you can prevent it from auto-running or auto-launching IF you update the drive software to the latest version. This software is necessary for an advertised feature of the drive: Data Encryption. It also does one click backups, and has some other utilities as well. Finder reported 999.2 GB Free on this disk ( Under Snow Leopard 10.6.2 )... So about 800 MB is used for overhead to do what it does. If this bothers you, then don't buy this drive.<br /><br />The other complaint was about the cable. Either is was too loose or "proprietary". There may very well have been some loose cables in the early batches, but the one that came with my drive in March 2010 fits snug and secure. In fact, I can let the drive dangle in midair, suspended by the cable, and the drive still stays mounted. I do not recommend doing that though... The cable is NOT proprietary. It is an 18" micro USB cable. This is a standardized interface that is used on newer devices like the new blackberries, and the Amazon Kindle for example.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Huge Capacity (999.2GB Free)<br />- Very Small (2.5" Drive inside Enclosure)<br />- Bus Powered (No External Power Supply Needed)<br />- Affordable (Currently $149) <br />- Cross Platform Encryption Option<br />- Free Cross Platform Backup Software & Utilities<br /><br />Cons:<br />- WD Smartware Software is not removable and takes up 800 MB of space.<br /><br />Bottom Line: <br /><br />Epic Win for Western Digital & Amazon. I will be buying more of these drives and recommending them to my friends and clients.<br /><br />Fail for people who buy this drive without reading about it's well documented and advertised features, then complaining about it.

RE: Huge disappointment
October 27, 2009 I pre-ordered my WD Passport like 3 weeks in advance. When I first opened it, I was excited: slick design, smaller than my previous WDPassport, and ... it packed the whole 1TB. As I started using it I became more and more disappointed for 2 reasons:<br />1. software, I didn't really tried to erase it, but as I noticed from the reviews it's impossible. Without the software was so much easier.<br />2. USB connection: I'm afraid to move my notebook or the Passport itself: slightest move and you get disconnected, have to start all over again with the software. I was thinking of duct-taping the USB to the disk :-)<br />Conclusion: don't buy, wait until WD comes up with sth new.<br /><br />Updating my review<br />May 10, 2010:  Glad to share the news: WD offers the USB cable replacement free of charge. I recently received mine (in less than a week) and it fits perfectly. Now I can surely say that I'll continue using the WD products.<br />Follow this link to submit your USB replacement request:  [...]

Smooth, Quiet, Fast... Better Than My Other Passports
First of all, the cable is fine and it's a lot better than the other cables that came with WD passports. The old USB cables did have a serious problem with jiggling loose and I could never use them on my laptop if there was any chance the laptop might move even a little for fear of disturbing the cable. I do not have that problem anymore with this passport. <br /><br />The USB cable is a micro USB cable that is the same as on my BlackBerry 8900. Everyone crying about the "proprietary" cable... get a grip. It's not and it fits way more securely than the cable type it replaced. <br /><br />I'm favorable to the software too. I want something hardware based that will password protect my drive because I use WD Passports exclusively as portable backup drives that are secondary backups in case of disaster. I own a bunch of them. This also means that I don't need to interact with the drive all that often so perhaps if I had to use this drive a dozen times a day and had to deal with the auto-mounting partition, it might get annoying, but it hardly seems like a big deal to me. I don't need the backup software on it so I can't comment on if that's any good at all but it's not getting in the way either. I use Apple's Time Machine programs to backup directly to this disk at least once a week and it has no conflicts with the permanent backup software on the drive. <br /><br />As for the drive itself, all I can say is that it's so far so good. I've only had mine a few weeks. It's worked fine, it's fast, it's quiet, and it doesn't accidentally disconnect all the time like some of my older WD Passports. I normally wouldn't write a review so soon as the real test is if the drive is healthy after a few months of real use, but I just couldn't believe all the  bellyaching going on here. Until further notice, I wish all of my WD Passports were like this version.

A great External Hard Drive, Looks Good Doing Its Job

An easy way to carry around an extra TB or two of storage...
I'm a long term WD-Passport user and looked at these drives with a bit of trepidation given the reviews that I've seen here and elsewhere.   However, I carry around a few 512GB drives and one of them was getting a bit low on space, so I thought it time to upgrade.<br /><br />I like the new WD drives because they are smaller and sleeker than the older WD Passport drives. Well, I should be a bit careful with my words.  Compared to my old 512GB WD Passport, thew new drive is slightly wider and thicker, but about a half inch shorter.  It is also about 1 ounce heavier (7.2 oz vs 6.2 oz on my old drive).<br /><br />I had no problems plugging in the drive and just installing the driver without having to install their "SmartWare" software (an oxymoron if I ever saw one...) by just selecting the device in the hardware management, selecting update driver, and browsing to the "Extras\WD SES Device Driver" on the CD image that was mounted when I plugged in the drive.<br /><br />Later, I installed the software just to see how it worked and was not impressed.  However, I'm a long term computer hack that doesn't want hand-holding software.   I could see how this software could be useful for the standard off-the-shelf windows configuration that most average users have on their system.<br /><br />So I uninstalled the software and use my own copy/backup routines.  <br /><br />Some have complained about the lost space due to the software being stored/managed in a protected partition that you can't delete on the drive.   I'm not so concerned about losing a few hundred megabits on a terabyte drive and it isn't uncommon for manufacturers to have protected partitions for software restoration/debugging (Dell has a small protected partition on most, if not all, of the systems they sell to be used for diagnostics should there be a problem.   Yeah, with Dell, if you know what you're doing you can go erase that partition (which I used to do in my younger days when every byte of disk space mattered, but no longer feel that the return is worth the cost/effort).<br /><br />Some have also complained about the connector.  It has changed from a standard mini-USB to a micro-USB.  It is still a standard connector, just a smaller one that most small electronics are moving to (and the phone industry appears to be moving to standardize upon.  My other micro-USB connectors that I have for several other devices with the same connector all work fine with this drive.<br /><br />I don't know if my experience is that different from others because WD has fixed their issues in later releases of the drive, or they have more clearly explained the resolutions for issues that they've been experiencing or if I'm just less concerned about the little stuff that doesn't have an impact on how I will use the drive.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the device and don't have a problem recommending them.<br /><br />BTW - WD has several cases out there for this drive.  I've purchased both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CA19W4">Western Digital Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Portable Drives WDBABJ0000NBK-NRSN  - Black</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9KZU2">Western Digital Soft Carrying Case for My Passport Portable Hard Drives WDBABK0000NSL-WASN (Silver)</a>.   I find I prefer the soft case because it is sized a bit better for this drive and is smaller than the hard case.  However, if you're going to bang the drive around a lot, you might consider the hard case as I think it would provide a bit better protection (I'm not too hard on my drives, though I carry them around everywhere and I travel a lot).<br /><br />

This Swedish bestseller deserves to be a blockbuster here too.
A 24-year-old computer hacker sporting an assortment of tattoos and body piercings and afflicted with Asperger Syndrome or something of the like has been under state guardianship in her native Sweden since she was thirteen. She supports herself by doing deep background investigations for Dragan Armansky, who, in turn, worries the anorexic-looking Lisbeth Salander is "the perfect victim for anyone who wished her ill." Salander may look fourteen and stubbornly shun social norms, but she possesses the inner strength of a determined survivor. She sees more than her word processor page in black and white and despises the users and abusers of this world. She won't hesitate to exact her own unique brand of retribution against small-potatoes bullies, sick predators, and corrupt magnates alike.     <br /><br />Financial journalist Carl Mikael Blomkvist has just been convicted of libeling a financier and is facing a fine and three months in jail. Blomkvist, after a Salander-completed background check, is summoned to a meeting with semi-retired industrialist Henrik Vanger whose far-flung but shrinking corporate empire is wholly family owned. Vanger has brooded for 36 years about the fate of his great niece, Harriet. Blomkvist is expected to live for a year on the island where many Vanger family members still reside and where Harriet was last seen. Under the cover story that he is writing a family history, Blomkvist is to investigate which family member might have done away with the teenager. <br /><br />So, the stage is set. The reader easily guesses early that somehow Blomkvist and Salander will pool their talents to probe the Vanger mystery. However,Swede Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is no humdrum, formulaic whodunit. It is fascinating and very difficult to put down. Nor is it without some really suspenseful and chillingly ugly scenes....  <br /><br />The issue most saturating The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that of shocking sexual violence primarily against women but not excluding men. Salander and Blomkvist both confront prima facie evidence of such crimes. Larsson's other major constituent elements are corporate malfeasance that threatens complete collapse of stock markets and anarchistic distrust of officialdom to the point of endorsing (at least, almost) vigilantism. He also deals with racism as he spins a complex web from strands of real and imagined history concerning mid-twentieth century Vanger affiliations with Sweden's fascist groups. <br /><br />But Larsson's carefully calibrated tale is more than a grisly, cynical world view of his country and the modern world at large. At its core, it is an fascinating character study of a young woman who easily masters computer code but for whom human interaction is almost always more trouble than it is worth, of an investigative reporter who chooses a path of less resistance than Salander but whose humanity reaches out to many including her, and of peripheral characters -- such as Armansky -- who need more of their story told.          <br /><br />Fortunately, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English translation will be followed by two more in the Millennium series: The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Air Castle that Blew Up. I can't wait. Larsson also made a 200-page start on a fourth book, but sadly he succumbed to a heart attack in 2004 and his father decided the unfinished work will remain unpublished.  <br /><br /> I recommend this international bestseller to all who eagerly sift new books for challenging intellectual crime thrillers, who luxuriate in immersing themselves in the ambience of a compellingly created world and memorable characters, who soak up financial and investigative minutiae as well as computer hacking tidbits, and who want to share Larsson's crusade against violence and racism.

Best Book of the Year

A tale that hits close to home....
I got all three books in the trilogy as a present,<br />and read them all in less than a week (in Swedish), a personal <br />record. <br /><br />The first book is now available in English. <br />(The literal tranlation would have been "Men who Hate Women".)<br /><br />The books are complete page-turners, the suspense <br />keeps building. The author's death prior to publication<br />may have contributed to some minor errors of fact and<br />of internal consistency, but this does not detract from<br />the readability. <br /><br />The background portrayal of a school system<br />gone haywire and of a mental health system out of control, <br />both violationg people that don't quite fit in with the <br />Swedish way resounds with its plausibilty. I am left with <br />the impression that the author has first-hand experience <br />with the horrors of the former, if not necessarily the <br />latter. <br /><br />Curiously, the author fails to draw the conclusion that<br />it is the welfare state itself that is the cause, he clearly<br />embraces it  - but then, he is a dyed-in-the-wool Swede. <br /><br />A piece of advice to the reader: It is helpful to have a <br />physical map of Sweden handy; with the exception of one<br />of the main locations (Hedeby, which exists only unrelatedly<br />in Denmark) all the towns are real.<br /><br />The "Millenium" magazine featured in the books exists<br />in the real world as "EXPO", and Mikael Blomkvist is <br />clearly the author's alter ego. I believe that somebody <br />familiar with the "in crowd" in Stockholm will find several<br />matches between the fictitious characters in the trilogy<br />and real people. <br /><br /><br />Nils Andersson<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

A Swedish whodunnit that will make you miss appointments
I bought this book because of its good reviews, because I love Sweden, and because I'd read about the sad and premature death of its author.  <br /><br />I don't often read mysteries, but this one had me hooked pretty quickly.  You can't help being sorry that there will be no more new books from Larsson, but it's a relief to know there are two more books to come in this trilogy, because the characters he created are strong enough to carry that many and more.  It's like having a wonderful first course and knowing there are still two to go.  <br /><br />Mikael Blomqvist is a complex protagonist, dogged, humane, flawed and sometimes insecure.  His sidekick, the resourceful Lisbeth Salander, who hates to be compared to Pippi Longstocking (thereby making the comparison for us), is even more complicated.  Personally, I liked her, and I'm intrigued to know more about her, which will hopefully happen in the next two books.<br /><br />Plot-wise, this kept me guessing right to the end, with many satisfying twists and surprises.  The writing is plain and unadorned, but with a story like this you really don't need lyricism.<br /><br />All I can say is, I hope the translator is working fast on the sequels!

Became a fan after the movie...
I had heard about the fantasy books by a friend when they first came out but didn't have the time to look into them. By the time the movie came out, I'd nearly forgotten about the book referral, but asked my hubby to take me as it looked like a good vampire romance flick. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest forests, rivers, and coastline was breathtaking and as a native to this area, it was like going out into my own backyard which made the film that more appealing. I was so captivated by the actors portrayal of the characters (the facial expressions and emotions brought out of the characters by Rob, Kristen, Peter, Nikki, and the rest were mesmerizing) and the depth of the back-story left me desiring more! The very next day after viewing the movie in the theater - I raced to the bookstore to grab the first book. I was hooked, read through all four books (plus went to the authors website to read the extra materials she had posted there) in a week. Then, still not satisfied, went back and saw the movie several more times - IN THE THEATER, something I've never felt compelled to do before - because I was so drawn to the characters and the story. This may have been written for the young adult audience but I'm 32 and a parent of four children, and still found the story to be well worth my time. <br /><br />If you haven't read the stories, I encourage you to do so. Regardless, this film will be a treasured part of your movie collection and one you'll be sure to watch several times before you'll feel satisfied.

Obsessing over Twilight and can't wait for the DVD!!
I came into the Twilight series not expecting much. The books were, after all, marketed to the teen crowd, so I originally dismissed it.  I didn't expect much from the film.  I wanted to see it not for the story, but because I knew Robert Pattinson from "Harry Potter" and enjoy the vampire book/movie genre.  <br /><br />4 books and 7 viewings later, I am happy to report that I am now a happily obsessed "Twilighter."   <br /><br />Going into the movie, I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. As soon as the Cullen siblings walked through the cafeteria door, I knew I was in for the ride. And by the time Edward and Bella were sitting together at the restaurant in Port Angeles, I was smitten. The love story, the beautiful vampires, and the amazing chemistry between leads Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, made this film - for me - utterly irresistible. I knew I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over, and the female relatives that I went to see it with couldn't agree more.<br /><br />7 viewings later, I am still obsessed.  Like "Titanic" and all the wonderful Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell tv/movie adaptations before it, I was enthralled by the love story of Edward and Bella. Edward Cullen, a 108 year old vampire trapped in the body of a 17 year old, falls in love for the first time...to a human - a young unsuspecting girl named Isabella Swan.  Bella becomes equally fascinated by Edward, and this mutual fascination soon grows into yearning and love.  Theirs is a Romeo & Juliet like love story but this time it's not a family feud that keeps them apart, but the fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella is a human - the predator and the prey fall in love (or as Edward puts it, "...and so the lion falls in love with the lamb").  Within the story are some other conflicts, as Edward and his family's true nature must remain a secret, and as other vampires threaten Bella's life.<br /><br />Author Stephenie Meyer has crafted an irresistible tale, and screenwriter Rosenberg Melissa Rosenberg does a fine job of staying faithful with the novel. Some scenes and plotlines are changed around or omitted in order to make it work on film, but the essentials are there.  Director Catherine Hardwicke does a superb job of bringing all the elements together and guiding her young cast through the journey, so I was saddened to hear that she will not be helming the sequel.<br /><br />The major breakthroughs in this film, however, are the young and talented leads - Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. What started out as a small independent film has now become a worldwide phenomenon and has catapulted Rob and Kristen to the brink of superstardom.  And this is no accident.  The charismatic and versatile Robert Pattinson is brilliant as Edward. He properly conveys the internal conflict that rages within Edward and brings it out in full force.  When he's onscreen, you couldn't take your eyes off him.  His Edward can be gentle, loving and tender, but also fearsome and dangerous.  Kristen Stewart brings a beautiful and nuanced performance.  She is exactly how I pictured Bella and she does an excellent job of bringing the character to life.  The supporting cast is also wonderful.  Of the supporting roles, Billy Burke (Charlie Swan), Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen), Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) are standouts. I think everyone - with the exception of Nikki Reed's Rosalie Hale/Cullen (who I feel just doesn`t fit Rosalie physically) - are perfectly cast.<br /><br />I am also a fan of the soundtrack and Carter Burwell's amazing score, and I highly recommend purchasing these as a companion to the dvd.  I am thrilled that the dvd is finally coming, and I although the final specs are not yet available, I hope that Summit Entertainment will release a dvd version filled with extras, deleted/extended scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.  I'm a huge fan of the books and I feel that the cast and crew of Twilight has done an amazing job of bringing one of my favorite books to life.  I'm looking forward to New Moon, and I hope that it will be as good as, if not better than, the first film.  This film is a gem and one of my favorite love stories ever. Bella and Edward has joined the ranks of Elizabeth and Darcy, John Thornton and Margaret Hale, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, Cathy and Heathcliff,  Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater, and yes Romeo and Juliet, as two of my very favorite romantic couples that has ever graced the big and small screen.<br />

Enjoy The Movie For What It Is..
Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helps understand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I've seen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. But hey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wide age range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job and can't wait for New Moon.

Absolutely Amazing
This movie created a whole new obession that started with the books in the twilight series. It started with my 14 year old "teen" son saying I had to get a book for him. Well, that was a few weeks before the movie was released. As word traveled and the buzz about the upcoming movie approached. I read his book. I made it to the movie a few days after it was out. I loved it. But did not expect to see it again until it came out on DVD. Then I read the rest of the books in the twilight series. And somehow I was drawn back to the movie a week later. I felt like I was in Bella's head and needed to see the flick again. I left with more appreciation than the first time. I started to think more about the film and books. The love story alone makes you want more. When Edward says to Bella,"You don't know how long I have waited for you" your heart skips a beat and your body goes numb. I got the movie companion at a local store. I was surprised at the low budget. I also started to see "why" the director did what she did in the movie. Why the vampire's running or tree climbing wasn't the special effects we are used to in this day in age. I started to fall in love with the essence of the movie for what it really is. I am in a trance every time I see it. I am addicted to the characters, story line and every possible crumb of the twilight world. I have seen the movie for the 10th time tonight. Every time I see it, I am still amazed at the way Catherine has brought it to light. Yes, somethings are left out from the book. Yes, scenes are different than described in the book. However, the script has word for word from the book thoughout here and there. To take a book and make a movie on a limited time and budget, and capture the audience is a tall order. To deliver a movie that has already been perfected in a reader's mind is even more difficult. The movie follows the story line smoothly and is one of the best book to movie adaptions I have seen in a long time. I believe that Robert's acting was spellbinding. He is Edward Cullen. I am amazed how he embraced and captured the character of a 100 something year old vampire so realisticaly for a 22 year old young actor. His facial expression's alone express the emotion's that Edward has for Bella. You leave the theatre wanting more! To see the movie without reading the books may leave you with a limited vision of what is behind the story.But over all you should love the movie no matter what. The movie is my favorite and I am now a very twilight-addicted married mom of 3 boys.

Lovely, incandescent, sensual and captivating!
An unusual and lovely teen, Bella, reluctantly moves to live with her father in the misty, verdant forests of Washington State. Her first day of school goes well due to friendly classmates but then she encounters a young man, Edward, who glares at her with feral scorn--his black eyes sparkle with offense when she is near. She determines to confront his rudeness. But the next time she sees him he is oddly courteous and sincere. As they get to know one another Bella discovers that Edward has super strength and can even read minds. But when she is shocked by the icy cold of his hand she knows the truth. He is a vampire.  <br /><br />Edward's mystery, beauty and old-fashioned manners are irresistible to Bella. He makes a chivalrous attempt to stay away from Bella to protect her from the vampire world, but it is too late for both of them because are deeply in love. Bella and Edward have a forbidden love. They belong to warring families. Like Romeo and Juliet their passion is intensified by transgression against norms of their heritage.  Bella is relieved to learn that the family of vampires Edward is a part of is unusual; they are "vegetarian" vampires, meaning they only drink the blood of animals. <br /><br />Edward and Bella spend idyllic hours romancing in the mossy green redwood forests. Physical touching is almost impossible because Edward must continually fight against his fierce instinct to drink her human blood. But their hearts touch through their eyes. Edward's tender yet ardent courtship of Bella is poignant and tantalizing. Then Bella is threatened by becoming the target of a rogue predatory vampire. This predatory vampire is tantalized by the challenge of a battle of wits and skill against Edward and his family, who unite to protect Bella. <br /><br />Meyer's brilliant Twilight series introduced a fresh new vampire world into the genre. And in the movie the freshness continues. Filmed in gorgeous redwood forests, it is startling to see vampires in the sunlit meadows yet seeing them in light does not make them less mysterious or menacing. The young actors in this film are well cast; beautiful but unusual. Their characters are not shallow teens; these are complex young adults that care deeply about their lives, friends and family. Bella, played with intensity and verisimilitude by lovely Kristen Stewart, is a worthy and courageous hero who does not hesitate to put her own life in danger to protect her mother and her father. Despite the fact that she is just a frail human she fights back against supernatural and human predators. Edward is equally interesting as he is physically seventeen but is much older in years. Yet Bella is his first love and he is terribly concerned that he will cause her harm. Oddly handsome Robert Pattinson plays Edward with magnetism and aching vulnerability.  Kudos to the rest of the actors, particularly kind-faced Peter Facinelli as Carlyle, sensitive Billy Burke as Bella's father, captivating Justin Chon as Erik Yorkie, piquant Christian Serratos as Angela Weber, striking Gil Birmingham as Billy Black--I could go on and on the casting was excellent.  <br /><br />Brilliant director Catherine Hardwicke matched the beauty of the ancient forests with the emotional tone of the scenes with authority and confidence. Though I have not seen this director's other films I look forward to seeing her work. <br /><br />Twilight the movie has had to make choices to adapt Meyer's huge novel to the screen yet no sacrifice of quality has been made. The movie sensitively portrays the thoughtful and passionate characters created by Meyer while it enthralls and entertains with its contemplative beauty. Vampires symbolize the primal drives in all of us but in Twilight we are introduced to vampires who choose to put aside these urgent desires to avoid harm. Tender love and care are portrayed as the greatest power of them all. <br /><br />Seen it twice and can't wait to see it again.  An enthusiastic five stars--Twilight deserves to be a smash hit!

Amazon critic WAY off base
I just want to complain about the person who wrote the description/critique for Amazon. The person is so biased and ignorant of the allure of these books - this Twilight phenomenon. They aren't qualified to be writing the description. Of course they can dislike Twilight and its sequels if they choose -- but why in the world would they be chosen to write the blurb on the page where it sells? I'm not a kid -- no where NEAR that age -- and these books are as compelling to me as they are to my young daughter. There was humor in the movie for sure but certainly nothing "not" intentional. And to say the Edward Cullen role/actor is a simpering puppyish flaw played by Robert Pattinson: that's downright unbelievable. The writers mentality would surely have found the same silliness in the brooding angst of James Dean. It's no accident that Pattinson has become a world-wide star because of Twilight. He sizzles.   I just think reviews for a best selling book should be written by people who understand what they're reading.

Loosely based on the book, awesome in its own way...
I am a a huge fan (okay more like obsessed) of the Twilight Saga.  So I was so excited to see this on the big screen.  At first view, I was a little disappointed because its not like the book in many ways.  I liked it, but I sat in the theater and verbalized my frustration with the differences while watching.  After seeing it a second time, I decided I love Twilight the movie in a different way than I love the book.  It kind of makes it a whole other way for me to love Twilight.  I am so excited for New Moon and Eclipse to come out, and hopefully Breaking Dawn will soon follow as well on the big screen.  I totally recommend this movie, but you need to read the books to get the whole picture because the books are amazing.  This movie is loosely based on the book in my opinion, and does not do the book justice, but again, if you look at it as a different rendition of the book, its fantastic.  They were spot on with the casting as well.  Kudos on that factor!  All in all, great book, great movie, but not a great movie if you are looking for it to be just like the experience the book gives you.  Its a different experience entirely and I love both entirely.

Editorial Review of the Editorial Review
I'd like to give an editorial review of the Amazon Editorial Review.  Ouch!  Could you be more negative and condescending towards Twilight fans in your "Review" of the movie, "Twilight?"  What is up with that?  Geez!  May I suggest that you review the movie, not the caliber of people YOU think are "stupid" enough to enjoy it?  (ie. "...teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment.")  How insulting, and it reveals you know nothing of the character who is Edward Cullen, nor much about teens.<br /><br />BTW, the movie is awesome, and Robert Pattinson does a GREAT job throughout.

Leave the complaints about problems elsewhere and review the movie
This movie was epic. When you get a little older..of which I am 30 you think that movies made for a younger generation won't affect you. I was not expecting much from this movie but received alot. Even though I understood the premise there was so much more. The acting in this movie was superb and there are so many layers to the emotions being conveyed that it will take more than one viewing to get them. This movie was amazing and I would recommend to anyone.

The Hero In Romance is Everything--Behold Pattinson's Edward
I did not expect to like this movie.  For one, I think vampire love stories have been overdone to death.  Coppola's DRACULA, starring Gary Oldman, is one of my all time favorite movies and I really didn't need any pretenders to that throne.  This was before I saw Edward as played by actor Robert Pattinson.  In a nutshell, anyone who was ever a teenage girl will instantly grasp the appeal of this movie.  There you are leading the typical angst ridden teenage life when in walks this gorgeous supernatural being who is totally in love with you.  He lifts you out of your ordinary existence into an extraordinary one.  He woos you in extraordinary ways too, even flying you around your Pacific Northwest territory and watching you sleep with adoration on his face.  He never sleeps, of course.  I would be surprised if men liked this movie.  I think a guy would only watch it if his girlfriend insisted. He also has the considerable after viewing problem of measuring up to Edward/Pattinson, which will be pretty depressing.  The special effects are nicely done.  The female lead does a good job.  The plot is good vampires vs bad vampires, aside from the love story that is.  Absolutely no one would watch this movie though without  Edward/Pattinson.  I saw a recent poll on VANITY FAIR about the sexiest, most beautiful man in movies today.  Robert Pattinson just routed every other man of any age in movies today in that poll.  Everyone voted for him.  Since every woman was once a teenage girl, that is all you need to be to fall in love with this movie.  The last time I saw a video which had this kind of effect was when Colin Firth played Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  I am absolutely unsurprised TWILIGHT was directed by a woman, Catherine Hardwicke.  Being a woman who was once a teenage girl, I am sure she knew exactly how to proceed with this material.  I am tempted to give this less than 5 stars because I am rather ashamed I liked it this much.  It is a big guilty pleasure movie for me.  However, I then think, "Hey, I'm not a movie critic.  I can really, really enjoy something without being all torn up over artistic merit."  So the five stars stays.  We all need our guilty pleasures.<br />

Does what I want a vacuum to do
Although most the reviews are for the 4870GZ and I bought the 4870MZ, I suspect the machines are basically the same so I won't repeat what others have already said about it except to say this is a solid machine with excellent suction and it did a great job on my carpets, both deep cleaning and returning the nap to a plush feel.<br /><br />I'm writing to say that, contrary to many reviews, the Power Paw does in fact attach to the vacuum. At least mine does. It comes with a clear plastic cover that attaches to the vacuum just below the top D-handle. If you look closely you'll find the mating point. You then simply clip the paw into the cover and it stores on the handle.<br /><br />Also, contrary to some reviews, the bare floor setting works fine. You just need to press the tab hard until you hear a click and it engages. The brush is then disabled for bare floor vacuuming.<br /><br />I really wanted to justify a Dyson but at 1/3 the price, this machine is all that I need. I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase.

Better than I expected!
My 12 yr old Sharp upright gave up the ghost so I needed a new upright for upstairs.  I read a lot of reviews here and at e-pinions and decided on this Eureka.  First I will say it is very important to read all of the manual, because it actually addresses some of the issues people have with this vacuum, such as:  (1) this machine is no heavier than my old one, but people complain it is heavy and hard to maneuver - the maneuverability and "heaviness" of it are greatly improved if one selects the proper brush height.  Set it too low and yes, you will be struggling to pull this vacuum back toward you.  The first time I used it OMG - it was quite a workout.  I figured when I vacuumed I would count that as my upper body workout!  Then I read the manual and duh!  I raised the brush height one notch and what a difference.  It's not light as a feather, but much better.  (2) people complain that the brush roll stop (hard floor) switch is hard to move.  The manual says it will be easier to move if the machine is on, the handle is released and you rock the machine back so there is no weight on the front wheels.  It is hard if you try to move it otherwise.  (3) the foot pedal for the handle release is pretty stiff, but if you find the "sweet spot" it's fine - just have to experiment with where to push.  On my machine the hard part is getting the handle locked back up.  I hope I don't have the belt breakage problems some people have had, but so far I'm pleased with its performance and it seems fairly sturdy to me.  I had recently cleaned my carpets with Capture (a dry powder) and this new vac got up quite a bit of powder my old vac left behind.  I loathe using tools on an upright thus I have a canister vac for that action - so I can't address the utility of that, but it looks way easier than on my old upright.  So far I am happy with this vac, and I am a neat freak who likes her carpets to look perfectly clean!  Hope this was helpful...

This Vac really sucks (-:
My wife and I have been around the block a time or two and, as with many of you, have been through our share of vacuums over the years.  I'm here to tell you this one works.<br />  Stay away from the TV "infomercials" plugging no-name vacs and making outlandish claims.  Remember the old saying, "if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is".  Trust the "trusted" names.<br />  Eureka has been around a long time.  We checked Consumer Reports before investing in a new upright vac.  They listed 3 as being excellent buys.  2 were Kenmores and the third was the Eureka 4870 series.  The letters at the end of the model don't mean much (the MZ has the "power brush", but the 4870 is important.  The ratings of all 3 vacs were basically the same, but the Eureka was half the price.<br />  The sucking power is incredible.  It's not the quietest unit in the world, but I'll gladly trade that for the job it does.  Right after buying this vac, someone (we have many young, devilish grandchildren), put eggshells in my wife's washing machine (front-load).  The shells got into the front seal of the washer, as well as all through the dryer before we saw them.  I took the crevice attachment of the Eureka and cleaned both machines out completely in the blink of an eye.  By the way, I've seen complaints that the new "power brush" doesn't work.  We've had no problem with this attachment. In fact, it's been everything Eureka says it is.  If you don't want to try it, there are several other versions of the 4870 that offer the traditional brush instead. We're very happy with this unit.

Great Vacuum, Especially for the Money
I researched for several months before making this purchase and i'm very happy with this vacuum.  Cleans exceptionally well and the power paw is great for picking up cat hair.  The HEPA system actually works because I don't sneeze at all while vacuuming and I have chronic allergies.  (It made me realize how poorly my hoover upright worked.  And it was only 2 1/2 years old.)  Yes, it's a little heavy, but every vacuum that has strong suction is.  I guess it's because of the large amp motor.  If you have pets, you won't be dissapointed.  The only thing I wished it had was an automatic cord rewind.  But for the price, I have no problem living without it. My last eureka lasted me 10 years, and when I finally got rid of it, it was because It was so beat-up, but it still worked great.  Not the case with my 2 1/2 year old Hoover.  This unit is a great deal for the money.

Best Household Vacuum
I am a senior and have usually purchased at least one vacuum a year in the last decade.  The Eureka Boss Smart -Vac Upright Hepa Vacuum proves to be a good vacuum at a reasonable price.  I wind up giving my own away or buying new for people I meet who need a vacuum, and thus I buy several over the years.  I always go back to Eureka as I find it is the most reliable and does a great job with all its attachments and ease of use.  The air dust not smell dusty when you vacuum so I know it is doing a good job filtering. Plus, the inside of the vacuum stays clean and all the dirt goes in the micro-filtration RR bags which are easily available online or in local stores. The hose is very easy to switch to and  use while you vacuum and really has a lot of suction.  Buy one, you'll save yourself all the comparison purchases I did of other brands (some much more expensive)  and you'll be very satisfied with this product.

Everything I hoped for
This Vacuum is all that I'd hoped for; plenty of power, nice varity with the attachments and the Power Paw attachment was a great idea. I use the Power Paw attachment for under furniture where that dust tends to build up on the carpet and the attachment cleans the carpet great. Pet hair comes off furiture, rugs and clothing easily with this tool. The reviews I read before buying were all positive. The Only thing I can say which some reviews had mentioned is the weight. It is a little heavy to lift, but not bad.

great product, great value
The Kirby vacuum we had spent a small fortune on 13 years ago finally went to its great reward and we were faced with replacing it.  After doing much research (including the very helpful reviews here at Amazon) we decided on this model.  After using it several times, we couldn't be happier.  It honestly cleans better than our Kirby ever did -- I can't believe what this thing picks up!  We have two kids who are in and out of the house constantly with their friends and a long-haired cat so there is plenty to clean up after.  The attachments are stored right on the vacuum so it's very convenient and easy to clean an entire room (blinds, furniture, baseboards, etc.) while you're vacuuming.  I don't think I will ever dust again -- I'm using the vacuum for everything and love how clean it is when I'm done.  We have a two-story home and we like it so much we bought another one to keep upstairs.  At that price, it was worth it.  It is no heavier than our Kirby was and I don't feel it's difficult to use at all.  We have frieze carpet and it feels soft and brand new every time we vacuum it now -- it really is amazing! The switch to bare floors is a little tricky -- you feel like you're going to break the lever because you have to push pretty hard -- but after you get the hang of it, it works really well.  My only complaint is that the hose could be a little longer to reach certain areas (high window framing, long flights of steps, etc.).  Save your money and don't buy more expensive models -- this one does everything you need in a vacuum (and more) for an awesome price!

Good for the money
After reading reviews etc. we decided to replace our current Eureka with this one.  Ours quit running because we did not really keep up with maintenance.  We have had it for 7+ years and like it.  I like that this one has the Paw attachment for the stairs.  It is a little heavy and noisy, but it cleans great.  This is a great vacuum for the money.

Sturdy!  Gets the dog hair, sand, etc..
I researched vacume cleaners on Consumer Reports before I bought, as I wanted one that could handle a few rugs and hardwood floors- we have a 2 year old and 2 labs.  Plus we just moved to the coast and there is a lot of SAND!  This is a loud, heavy machine that reminds me of my Grandmother's, but it works!  It gets everything up, whether it's on the bare floor or the rugs, and it has the hose if you need it as well.  This is a bit annoying to me, as I find that attachments just fall off and get in the way, but they are handy at times.  Anyhow, there are some bad vacumes and some way overpriced ones out there, so for the cost this one is great!

Expensive???
My only complaint is that the machine picks up so much dirt and dust that you have to spend extra on new bags to hold all!!!

Great sweeper
I bought this sweeper after spending less money on another brand. That one did not work for what I needed it for. I have tile floors and the Eureka Boss Smartvac works GREAT on them! This is the reason I bought this sweeper (and the good reviews). If you need a sweeper with a great suction and will work just as equally on carpet as it does on bare floors, then this is the sweeper to buy. It is a little heavy and hard to manuever at first but I have gotten used to it. Well worth the money! I will never go bagless again. They are just too messy and seem to have more build-up than the bagged sweepers.<br />

Kindle 2--many things to love.
As one of the original Kindle's biggest fans and an owner for over a year, I can speak to the Kindle from two perspectives--the benefits of owning a Kindle, and Kindle 2 improvements (as I've now had it for half a day)<br /><br />The benefits of owning a Kindle (these do not change)<br />- Absolutely, Jeff Bezos is right that the Kindle 'disappears' as you read it...as I read other reviews (and non-user critiques) about the Kindle, this point is often lost. Once you have the Kindle in your hands, you forget everything and become immersed in the content of what you're reading. Isn't that really the whole point?<br />- I read more now that I have my Kindle, 10 years out of college than I did when I was in school, and I really enjoy it. Books look a lot less intimidating when they aren't sitting on your bookshelf and 3 inches thick. I recently finished Team of Rivals, and I am sure that if I had to read it in book form, I would never have gotten through it because it would have felt so intimidating.<br />- Heft and weight is a complete non-issue with the Kindle. I like to read in odd positions (in bed, on the couch, on a plane, poolside, shifting around in a lounge chair) and I've always had trouble with real books because unless you are in the absolute middle of the book, it always is weighted to one side or another and frankly, my arm and pinkie finger gets tired holding it up. The Kindle is balanced and portable, and entirely usable in any situation.<br />- I can be in the middle of a lot of different books at once...not much more to say here. You never run out of space on the Kindle, and though it may be a little bit hard to maneuver around a lot of books in your library, it's still better to have access to all your books at any time.<br />- I now read newspapers. I always found physical newspapers to be clumsy and take up too much space to actually subscribe to. They are great for short content pieces, but terrible for reading in transit because the pages are so big. I also read some articles on my BlackBerry, but find myself scrolling a lot and waiting a long time for page loads. On the Kindle, you have wireless delivery, easy navigation, no ads, no need to flip to page D17 and find the place where you left off. You also have a searchable/annoted/bookmarked archive of all your newspaper articles if you ever need to find something again.<br />- All of these things can probably be accomplished with any eBook reader. The difference with the Kindle is that you have wireless delivery of content. This means, literally, that I can be sitting on the plane, start talking about what good books the guy sitting next to me has read recently, look it up on my Kindle, read the reviews and download it before the rest of the passengers have boarded and the plane doors close. This has happened.<br />- My biggest complaint, which I'm sure will be addressed in due course is that the entire wireless benefit does not exist outside of the US. I have taken my Kindle to Canada, Mexico and China, and I found that I had to (gasp), decide what I wanted to have on my Kindle before I left the US. Foreign language support would also be a plus, but again, I see why this might come later.<br /><br />Now, onto improvements with the Kindle 2<br />- There are the obvious ones: sleeker look and feel (it feels solid in your hands), sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again...you can read about these from various sources)<br />- The 5-way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version. This is very helpful when you want to select and highlight.<br />- There are now two layers of interaction...before when you were reading a paper, you could only go back to the previous screen to select the next article. Now, there is an option at the bottom of the screen to skip to the next article when you tire of the current one.<br />- Page loads are much faster. I can feel that the delay between pages is much less. Only issue is I need to recalibrate now--in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button. Now I need to push the button later.<br />- Text to speech is cloogey, but fun. I'm not sure how useful this will end up being. I tried to have the voice read the user's manual to me and it paused at commas and periods, but skipped right over hard returns. It also scrolled the page as it was reading, so if you are trying learn English and don't mind developing a metallic accent, it could really help. :-) You can also choose, male/female and speed. I think this could be a nice feature, though probably won't be using it all the time.<br />- Managing your books is much easier. It's easy to see what is in your archive and re-download onto the Kindle. Also easy to delete and manage your books. That 5-way button is magical...though a bit unintuitive--you need to train yourself to think that there might be something useful if you scroll to the right.<br />- Dictionary is improved. Now you can highlight a word and it automatically gives you a definition at the bottom of the screen. It also lets you look up words (that are not in the text), which is an improvement since the last version.<br /><br />I'm sure there are still a bunch of things that I haven't yet discovered about the Kindle 2. I don't really bookmark/annotate/highlight that much, but for those who do, I think this has also been improved upon.<br /><br />Overall, the Kindle is an amazing product. It did the basics well in the original model, the Kindle 2 has improved on a lot of dimensions, and I look forward to seeing what new bells and whistles are still to come.<br /><br />If you are considering buying one, and need to see before you order, find someone in your city who has one and can show you. There is now a special board for this on Amazon. Kindle owners (at least this one), are always happy to talk about it, and you will be delighted with the screen and the possibilities in such a compact package.

263 Kindle 2 Reviews - Why Read Another?
As I type this message there are 263 Kindle 2 reviews on Amazon's web site. Why bother with another? I'm not one inclined to writing reviews but I do examine them carefully before I make a significant purchase, here on Amazon.com and on other seller web sites. So on the chance that I might say something that helps a potential buyer make up their mind, particularly someone who has not owned the first Kindle, this is my small effort to give back to the process.<br /><br />First of all, I loved Kindle 1 although I noted several shortcomings due primarily to the design of the hardware. I'm glad to learn that every shortcoming(except one) has been fixed beyond my expectations. When I received my Kindle 2 yesterday, I eagerly removed it from the shipping container, plugged it in and began to download my library. As I did I marveled at the new Kindle's fresh, sleek design. It is a beauty!<br /><br />The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement. My original thought was that I wanted to use my Kindle 1 without a cover but I quickly learned that doing so wasn't practical. I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons. So I began to use the cover it came with so I could hold the Kindle by the cover, only to learn that this cover did not keep the device securely in place very well. So I bought an m-edge cover, which is bulkier and the front does not fold back easily. I was stuck reading using two hands and I didn't like that at all.<br /><br />Kindle 2 solves all these problems. I'm not going to bother with a cover at all now. I love the way it feels in my hand without a cover. It is easy to navigate without any risk of accidentally changing the page I'm on. I will probably buy a Belkin sleeve to protect it when I take it out but that's all. Now my reading experience is complete! [Note added 3/5/09: instead of buying a Belkin sleeve, I did made my own protector. See the discussin thread and photos here: [...]<br /><br />The Kindle 2's redesigned features are fantastic. The display is better and the 5-way button is a major improvement. I do a lot of highlighting and this design fix is huge. Looking up words is much easier and many times faster. One improved feature I haven't notice any comment on is the progress bar at the bottom of each book page. Now it shows the total number of locations and the percent already read. This is so much better than the old way of determining how far I'm into a book. Thank you, design team!<br /><br />The fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user-serviceable is not an issue with me. Even with a few hundred books in my library, it will be a long time before the 2 gig memory starts to be a limiting factor and when it does (if it does) I'll just archive what I've already read. Amazon's design team has made it simple to pull archived books back to the Kindle 2 without having to go to a computer.<br /> <br />The only item on my wish list that was not addressed in Kindle 2 is the lack of an improved file storage system. It would have been nice to have that but it doesn't take away from my enjoyment. [Note added 3/5/09: Bufo Calvo came up with an inovative method of catagorizing books on Kindle that works great so this item is no longer on my wish list. [...]<br /><br />Page turns are significantly faster and the page reloads are less intrusive to the reading experience. On/off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible. The home page is easier to navigate. There are other improvements that many others have already noted so I'm going to stop here without repeating everything that's been said already. But the biggest thing about Kindle (both 1 and 2) is the Amazon store and how simple it is to browse and buy books from. I'm so impressed with the way they have seamlessly brought the store together with the reading device via Whispernet to make the digital reading experience such a wonderful thing to enjoy. <br />

Soul of the e-reader; Kindle 2 gets closer to delivering the promise.
I'm a great believer in the e-book concept; having been reading e-books since the Apple Newton (and down through various Palms, Sony Reader PRS505, and Kindle 1).  The dream has always been a portable electronic device that could hold a ton of reading material, automate subscriptions and facilitate quick easy downloads, and be as portable, as easy on the eyes, and as intuitive as a book.  The Kindle 1 was the first really practical device to get close to that dream.  The combination of the reflective e-ink screen, effortless Whispernet wireless cellular connection to Amazon (and the Internet - without requiring hooking up to a computer, ever), and Amazon's tremendous ability to rope in a critical mass of book and periodical content made the promise of the e-reader real for the first time.  But the Kindle 1 had some rough edges that got in the way of effortlessly reading.  Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages; the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see; the occasionally awkward menus; the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off.   With the Kindle 2, Amazon has addressed all these issues and more.  Each of the differences looks superficially subtle, but they collectively combine to make the Kindle 2 feel polished and comparatively effortless to use.  It comes closer than any other device yet made to getting out the way and leaving the reader alone with the text, like a book.   <br /><br />The first thing that grabs you about the Kindle 2 is how elegantly thin it is.  The Kindle 2 is THIN.  It positively disappears in your briefcase.  The second thing is the buttons.  They are smaller, but well placed and critically pivot from the edge inwards towards the screen.  This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons.  Yet changing pages is effortless when you do - the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them.  The problem with the case was addressed by using a post-in-slot locking arrangement reminiscent of recent Palm organizers.  The fact that you must buy the case now is disappointing but the silver lining is that you can opt to individualize your Kindle.  The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel.  It is tactile and elegant, but doing away with the door means doing away with the SD memory card slot that the Kindle 1 had, as well as the ability to change batteries.  This is, undoubtedly, the most controversial aspect of Kindle 2.  Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them.  In practice it's no hardship to live within a 2GB (1.4 GB available) limit, especially if you are willing to trust Amazon to archive items you are done reading.  The screen is incrementally improved.  16 shades of gray is WAY better than 4.  They say it's faster, but only a tiny bit.  I notice the snappiness of Kindle 2's performance, but it's certainly not a dramatic difference.  The e-ink screen's text quality is basically unchanged from Kindle 1.  40% white is pretty good, but the Kindle 2's screen looks just like the one on Kindle 1.  Where the improved e-ink screen really shines is dynamic update - which is fast enough to allow a live cursor within the text area.  This does away with the scroll wheel and side cursor of Kindle 1.  In Kindle 2 this has been replaced with a 5 way joystick (4 directions plus click down to select).  The joystick does plenty more than just allow you to actually select a word to get a definition on.  It lets you quickly navigate periodicals - moving to the next article with just a click right or left, or up to the section or article list with a flick up or down.  Losing the side cursor gives Kindle 2 a cleaner look - but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit.  This ease of navigation is one of the most compelling new features of Kindle 2 for me.  As for the text to speech feature, it is probably invaluable to some - but not me.  I like Stephen Hawking a lot but don't want that voice to read me a book.  Talk to me later and maybe I'll have changed my mind.<br /><br />All in all, Kindle 2 feels like Amazon is getting to the soul of the e-reader.  Most of the annoying things about Kindle 1 are gone, but almost all the strengths remain, or are accentuated.  The trouble is, the differences are subtle.  At first glance, Kindle 2's enhancements look very incremental; almost trivial.  Clearly the future will hold color, and better contrast than 40% - but these enhancements are in E-ink's court, not Amazon's.  I have other items on my wish list for the future - like being able to fold out a larger screen to better display bigger books.  I'd like the content manager to allow me to create folders so I can organize my growing collection of titles.  I really really want Kindle to be able to read PDF files natively (you still have to e-mail in your PDFs for conversion with Kindle 2).  These thing will come, I'm sure, in time.  Meanwhile, the Kindle 2 is currently the best e-reader on the planet.  In terms of in-the-hand usability it blows Kindle 1 away.<br /><br />Some of my colleagues and I at work have been talking lately about the implications of the Kindle on the future of the book. Kindle eradicates page numbers, loses the physical form, forces all books into a common size and shape, and homogenizes the typeface.  Clearly something is lost compared with a printed book.  Yet, what is gained is undeniable and as impending as the weather.  The ability to carry whole libraries (like the iPod did for music), and the ability to get the daily paper, magazine, or a new book automatically - practically instantly - at a savings - is literally a dream come true.  There's little doubt that Kindle has utterly transformed the book distribution model.  The big divide seems to be Amazon's .azw, Kindle's file format, and .pdf, Adobe's Acrobat format which has become almost universal. PDF's universality has the feeling of almost being open source (which it is not) because the there's no copy protection or copyright features built into it.  While .pdf-only format readers are around, and tons of .pdf titles are available, they tend to be composed disproportionately of public domain, technical libraries, and other arcana.  That's because mainstream publishers don't want to sign on to a format that doesn't protect them.  Amazon's .azw format does, and thus Kindle has that awesome selection of content.  In the modern economics of increasing returns, early critical leads in technology tend to become dominant trends.  Kindle's .awz format seems to be on the verge of having an unsurmountable lock on the e-book market as a result.  When it comes to the actual book titles (and periodicals) you'd like to read, Amazon's Kindle has no competition.  For me, the dream of a workable e-book is realized.

Kindling a Revolution
When the first Kindle was announced my Christmas list was immediately complete. It was populated with one request: Amazon Gift Certificates. My excitement was difficult to measure and probably difficult for people to tolerate. A device that carried 250 books? With an "onboard" dictionary? That's all I needed to know. What surprised me, though, was that none of my family or friends knew what I was talking about. "What's a Kindle?" they would ask, to which I would squint my eyes and reply, "Huh?"<br /><br />How so many people could be unaware of what was to me a revolution - many of whom were avid readers - was puzzling. Even after receiving the Kindle (finally - after months of waiting) people who saw me with it would ask, "What is that?" When my answer, "It's Amazon's Kindle!" succeeded only in deepening the creases in their foreheads I was dumbfounded. This is the Kindle! Hello?<br /><br />Apparently Amazon's website, one of the most heavily trafficked web sites on the internet, wasn't enough marketing. The Kindle wasn't close to being a household name, even a year after its release. And people to whom I showed the Kindle often weren't that impressed.<br /><br />That has all changed with the release of the Kindle 2. Big change in the so-called impression department.<br /><br />The Kindle 2 arrived about an hour before I left for a class and I took it with me intending to explore the Kindle 2 during the break. I arrived at class early and with the extra time started familiarizing myself with the new device.<br /><br />I didn't have it out for more than ten seconds before someone asked, "Is that the new Kindle?" Another, "Is that the one that talks?" All seven classmates were keenly interested in this second generation Kindle, and all had heard of it - the Kindle 2, that is, not just the Kindle. They all knew that a second had been unveiled, and at least one wasn't aware of the first until they became aware of the second. Class started, and I had to put the new Kindle away. <br /><br />When break time came, I thought I'd have a bit of time. Nope! People stayed in the room, demanding that I,"Make it talk!" or "Show me the dictionary!"<br /><br />While I understand that there's been a good deal of time for word-of-mouth to advertise the Kindle, there's something else at work here. This device has caught people's attention; it's a head turner. The  design is slick, attractive, thin and, I would say, sexy! That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled  of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier. I found that the Kindle 2 is immediately appealing to the eye and once described in the barest of terms people want one for themselves. And I mean everyone. Every single person that has seen my Kindle and heard my thirty-second advertisement of its features has expressed a desire to own one NOW. That wasn't the reaction the first Kindle had, and my thirty-second advertisement was roughly the same.<br /><br />Congratulations, Amazon. You've just invented the equivalent of the iPhone for e-books.<br /><br />The biggest selling point for me is still the onboard dictionary. If you're a true reader then you know the value of having a dictionary at hand and the frustration you experience if one isn't. My vocabulary is better than average but I still run into unfamiliar words (too often for my comfort!) and I'm one of those people who want to know the meaning of every single word I read. But who wants to go to the doctor's office with their favorite book AND a dictionary? Well, I did. I wanted to bring a dictionary along when I went places where I'd have to wait forever, but I rarely did. Now I don't have to. Everywhere I go I'll have the book I'm reading and a dictionary with which to lookup any words whose meaning I've either forgotten or never knew.<br /><br />What I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion. It's very difficult to accidentally turn a page (a far too frequent occurrence with the first generation Kindle), yet simple and effortless to purposefully turn a page. Page turning is quicker and the text and pictures are crisper. The reading experience, already an excellent one, is greatly improved. I'll miss the scroll wheel, even though it wasn't exactly the height of design innovation and was vaguely Coleco-esque, and it's replacement, the 5-way controller will take a bit of getting used to. It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those. Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done. (I'll leave that to your imagination since this is a family show.)<br /><br />Another huge plus for Amazon is that plugging the Kindle into your computer via the USB port no longer drains the Kindle; instead, it charges it. They were smart and designed a USB cable and wall adapter that work together so that you don't have to keep track of two cables. It's also easy to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port (some Bluetooth speakers come equipped with those). Though I wouldn't recommend using the Kindle while driving.<br /><br />If you were hedging on the first Kindle and decided to wait, now is the time to pounce. This is the real deal. You'll love it.<br /><br />If you have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever. This I promise: if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages. And the longer you go, the less you'll get for selling your old Kindle, and that, without question, will be frustrating. Another tip for selling: if you bought a cover to replace Amazon's ridiculous original cover, sell it packaged with the Kindle. You'll sell it quicker and for more money.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the Amazon looked a bit too much to Apple when designing this. It's like a large iPod with a keyboard, sans the 32gb storage. (They could only get 1gb of storage into that, and Apple gets 32gb into the much, much smaller iPod Touch? Then again, I'm not an engineer so this issue may be moot.) You can't carry an extra battery - though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non-issue - and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod-like fixed backing. They also took out the memory slot, and the SD card was a big selling point for people who liked to carry their entire library around with them. While I do understand that concern, 1500 titles is a LOT of titles.<br /><br />I'm a book lover. The smell of old books is almost an aphrodisiac. The feel of a book - it's difficult to describe. Even the word itself has some magic to it. I'm old school when it comes to books, and I love this device.<br /><br />You will too.

Great in so many ways!!!
There were many reasons I decided to purchase a Kindle - my hands ache when holding a book open, I get headaches from reading stuff on the computer, I wanted something I could throw in a bag and take anywhere, and it holds so many items that I don't have to carry three or four novels with me in case I'm bored or finish one.  Nothing could prepare me for the actuality that is Kindle.  It integrated seamlessly into my life.  If I'm at the desk, it's beside me; if I'm in the bedroom, it's on the nightstand; I even take the silly thing to the john.  It's so much easier than a book.  <br /><br />I expected it to be a little awkward at first, but it really *does* get lost in your hands.  Suddenly, you look down after a couple of hours of reading, and realize you've been holding it all along and forgotten all about it.  I expected to read novels and blogs on it.  I never expected to be able to download all the .pdf technical manuals that I constantly have to weed through on the computer.  I work effortlessly now, looking at the computer, working through a segment, picking up the Kindle, searching for what I need in the manual, even highlighting it, or putting a note in the manual about how well it works.<br /><br />Note taking is my big thing.  When I'm looking at a book, I always find note-taking to be an instinct I have to avoid.  I see it as a destructive process.  I don't want to ruin my books.  Further, who can really concentrate on what they're reading with a pen in their hand?  It's two different mindsets.  Yet, with Kindle, I do just that.  I read a segment, I find a passage, I underline it.  I have an opinion, I drop in a note.  A question equals another note.  When I don't understand something, the dictionary is right at the bottom of the screen to define the word or teach me how to pronounce it; or I can surf to the web and find exactly what I need.<br /><br />It's so much better than surfing the web on my phone - and far more practical.  For one thing, there's no charge except battery power (no pun intended!).  For another, all of my research is in one place.  The book, notes, websites and highlights are all together - as they should be.<br /><br />I know a lot of people complain that it should have a bright screen so that you can read it at night, or that it should have color.  I say - nay!  The main *strength* of Kindle is that it reads *exactly* like a book.  No eye strain.  No having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes; or ending a session of reading with a headache.  No "hot lap" or mousing around to find the right page.  It's just like a book.  You hold it, you turn the page, it's effortless, you forget it's there.  Only what you're reading matters, and that's exactly how it should be.

The Dinosaur & the Kindle
I am not a gadget girl.  I am not an early adopter.  I am a dinosaur.  I am in love with books.  I like the feel of them, the smell of them, and I am a passionate supporter of independent booksellers.  I am the last person in the world who would buy a Kindle.  However, Amazon likes me.  They gave me a Kindle 2 as a reward for services rendered.  Well, who would turn that down?<br /><br />Here's the shocker... I LOVE it!  I can't even believe how much I love my Kindle.  A friend of mine wrote a detailed critique of the first Kindle, and I have to say that the new design is a vast improvement.  Aside from being slimmer and sleeker, there are plenty of places to hold the device comfortably without activating any functions.  The screen is easy to read off of, and I honestly believe that I can read faster on a Kindle than I do with a traditional book.  I'm not sure why.  Faster page turns?  What I can tell you is that it's exceedingly comfortable and easy to read off the Kindle anywhere, but especially when you have limited space--like on public transportation.  You can easily hold the Kindle and turn pages with a single hand.  <br /><br />The Kindle has several features that could best be described as... cool.  My eyesight is fine, but I can choose the font size that suits me best.  Likewise, I love the text-to-speech feature.  A big frustration in my life is that I can't work on my embroidery (I'm a dinosaur, remember?) and read at the same time.  Now, I can have the Kindle read to me while I stitch.  Yes, it's sort of tinny and mechanical, but it's still a really nice option to use occasionally.  In addition to reading published books, I read a lot of unpublished manuscripts.  It's not uncommon to see me schlepping around 600 pages of loosely bound paper.  The other day I had the amazing experience of forwarding an email with a manuscript attached to my dedicated Kindle address.  Within seconds, the entire MS was in my Kindle, formatted and ready to go.  Amazing!  I can even make notes on the MS in the machine.<br /><br />However, possibly the best thing about the Kindle is the fact that I can get internet access for free, almost anywhere.  I use it to check my email all the time now.  I wouldn't want to write a novel on the keyboard, but it's sufficient for brief communications.  Now when I go away for the weekend, I can leave my laptop at home!  It also works fine for basic internet surfing.<br /><br />One last thing I was unaware of is how much free or nominally-priced content there is for the Kindle.  I've got plenty to read, and I haven't purchased one $9.99 book yet.  My first Kindle "purchases" were all free public domain titles.  Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle--how can you do better than that?  I also read the Kindle Daily Post in the Kindle store religiously.  You never know when you'll be offered free content like a back-listed Lee Child novel or some contemporary fantasy.  Other authors such as Boyd Morrison and J.A. Konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers.  One more favorite is the free Amazon Daily blog, which is like a fun, timely magazine with short articles that update constantly.  The perfect entertainment for brief snatches of time.<br /><br />No, I never would have bought a Kindle.  And "real" books will still be a big part of my life, but I will never be without a Kindle again.  This dinosaur is evolving.

A Modest Rebuttal to Hands-On Review Critiques
I've had my Kindle 2 for about a week now and it certainly something to behold.  I did not purchase the 1st generation, although, I did get to briefly use one owned by a friend.  <br /><br />My Backstory: Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery/SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward/difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super-high price.  All these issues worried me and I was on the verge of canceling my order, but I am SO glad that I had enough faith to stick with it!  As a user, here's what I have to say in RESPONSE TO THOSE CRITIQUES:<br /><br />THICK BORDER: I am glad that the border is thick, because when I go to pick it up, it gives me ample area to grasp it with.  I don't know many people who would feel comfortable picking up electronics by their screen (potentially mashing up the pixels/e-ink wells, smudging the screen, or scratching the surface) but I would NOT feel comfortable risking that with a thinner border.  For me, the border is a plus.<br /><br />TOUCHSCREEN: While a touch screen would make things a lot faster, particularly in the Basic Web function, I've read that a touch screen would reduce the screen's clarity which would not be favorable in my mind.  Also, if it were to be a touchscreen, the chore of having to wipe off fingerprints would not be fun.<br /><br />BATTERY/SD SLOT: Meh, I don't miss them.  The Kindle comes with a mini USB cable that can connect to your PC, and although I haven't used it, I think it'd be very easy to just store your unused books on your hard drive.  As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b/c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus.  The batter lasts a LONG time, too.  I bought the 2 year warranty just in case, plus, it covers accidental damage!<br /><br />BACK LIGHT: So...where would you need a back light in this day and age to read?  Maybe in a movie theater, but it'd be just as distracting as those incessant texters, so why be a bother?  On a camping trip?  Maybe if you didn't bring a flashlight or a lamp to really "rough it".  Honestly, there is hardly a situation where you'll need to read in the dark.  If it's before bed, just get a lamp for your nightstand.<br /><br />KEYBOARD: The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri-letter entry or blackberry keyboard.  The buttons are not hard to press at all.  Every K2 button has a satisfying *click* to it so you know you pressed it.  Also, the size the keyboard takes up is an issue for some, but when I'm sitting on the ground, I like to rest it upright on my lap against my legs like an easel and the keyboard tends to get obscured by my jacket/shirt puffing out in front of me.  If the keyboard weren't as large as it is, I'd be obscuring my text, so I'm actually happy it is that size.<br /><br />PAGE FLIP SPEED: Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the "Next Page" button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page.  The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine.  Not a big deal at all.<br /><br />PRICE: Well...for a product this good, it's hard to expect much less.  Sure, it could go for mid-$100's and that WOULD make it more accessible to the mass market.  However, I think all the positives of the K2 greatly make it worth the price which I'll talk about below.<br /><br />My FAVORITE FEATURES of the K2: <br /><br />  - Inside-edge buttons - These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times.<br /><br />  - No lame welcome screen - This is self-explanatory.  The warm up time is a split second and it doesn't dilly-dally around.<br /><br />  - Instant book purchasing - Fast service and FREE samples that are lengthy enough for you to get a good idea of what you're buying.<br /><br />  - E-ink and matte screen - No harsh computer-screen look to it does not fatigue my eyes at all, and the matte helps reduce glare from light bulbs and the sun.<br /><br />  - Search - As a book reader, I've had way too many "Now where did I read that quote again?" moments and this eliminates it from ever happening again!  It's amazing!<br /><br />  - Wikipedia/Dictionary - Again, added reference, amazing!<br /><br />  - Basic Web - So...I hope that Amazon doesn't start charging for this service, because if they did, I probably wouldn't want to buy it anymore.  So, obviously, this is an EXPERIMENTAL feature on the K2, so who knows if it'll last, but omg, free internet access...WIRELESS internet access...I think I've died and gone to heaven.  I won't state numbers, but you iPhone and Blackberry users know what I mean with the monthly fees.  Granted, the K2 doesn't do images very well, flash/complex apps/or images at all, but it can essentially do everything your basic cell phone internet can.  So Amazon, if you read this, please don't start charging for the internet service, I would be very sad and I'm sure many others would be, too.<br /><br />IMPROVEMENTS for next time: <br /><br />1. On some of the menu screens and the home screen, it would be very nice for it to have a scrolling feature where when you keep selecting up at the top, it will bring your cursor to the bottom of the list or vice versa, back up to the top from the bottom.<br /><br />2. Security features:  I'm a little concerned about if my Kindle got stolen...You can de-register your Kindle, but I'd be really upset to know that someone else is using my hard-earned K2...I'm not asking for a remote detonator like in Mission Impossible, but perhaps a remote deactivation to ensure it can't be used by other users?<br /><br />3. Smarter page/link scrolling in Basic Web:  I realize this isn't one of the main features or the point of the Kindle, but it really takes quite a while and a bit of playing around to reach links.<br /><br />4. Weight:  It's a little bit (a smidgen) heavier than I would prefer, but not too much to be a burden.<br /><br />5. Glitches: (?) Maybe it's just me, but when I was reading the first few times, the screen would flash and it would bring me back to the home page...I hope it was an isolated incident because hasn't happened since.  Has this happened to anyone else?<br /><br />Finally, the whole Text to Voice thing:  It is a cool feature, but the fact that some authors won't let the Kindle read aloud should NOT deter anyone from buying a Kindle.  It was a fun feature, but I won't miss it too much.  I prefer to read on my own anyways...and after all, isn't encouraging reading the point of the Kindle, anyways?

review #7,082...
An update is at the end of this review.<br /><br />What can I add to what's been said by the 7,081 reviewers before me? Three things: first, why I almost didn't buy a Kindle; second, some less heralded Kindle features; and third, whether or not I regularly use Kindle to read books.<br /><br />I read a large number of reviews, blogs, and critical commentaries. Despite their overall more or less high evaluations, I focused on a few comments that concerned me. Chief among them were:<br /><br />**I realized I'd been reading only the one-star and two-star reviews. I started reading the four- and five-star reviews. Many contained useful, often rumor dispelling information.<br /><br />**"You can't share a Kindle book." Untrue. You can have up to six Kindles sharing all the books on your account. My wife and I are currently reading the same copy of Dan Brown's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KQ6BT6">The Lost Symbol</a> independently using our two Kindles. Kindle even keeps track of our individual places in the book.<br /><br />**I was concerned by Amazon's snatching the 1984 and other Orwell novels from customer Kindles. What I didn't know is Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos apologized, promised not to act so precipitously in the future, and returned the novels with their annotation files (this document is all over the web, search for `Bezos apology'). The apology doesn't make up for the rash act and his promise doesn't cover all future issues. But I believe Amazon will ride the rocky road of evolving e-book law and practice with the rest of us. Amazon seem to understand their and our interests in this area are much the same.<br /><br />**For some reason, I thought moving my own documents to Kindle was limited and cost money. It is nearly unlimited and you can do it for free if the 10-cent Amazon fee bothers you.<br /><br />**From my reading I became convinced Amazon had withdrawn text-to-speech under pressure from the Authors Guild. They haven't. They have permitted authors and publishers to restrict the feature for their publications. That lets the marketplace decide the matter. Does an author want to lose sales by eliminating text-to-speech for their book to please the Guild?<br /><br />I found simply backing up Kindle files to one's computer greatly mitigates many what-if/might-be fears. Such information plus taking just a bit of salt while reading complaints (did the screen crack when it was dropped just 5"? maybe, but mine didn't) made me comfortable enough to order a Kindle.<br /><br />Descriptions of some of the Kindle 2 how-to books provide good lists of Kindle's undocumented or less-advertized features: see the mobi book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00256Z3CM">Kindle Shortcuts, Hidden Features, Kindle-Friendly Websites, Free eBooks & Email From Kindle: Concise User Guide for Kindle DX, Kindle 2 & 1, Kindle for iPhone & iPod Touch (Kindle Manual)</a> and Emberson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GIPJ2Y">The Kindle 2 Cookbook: How To Do Everything the Manual Doesn't Tell You</a>.<br /><br />Over the past decade and a half, I bought several e-book readers. They generally worked but I just didn't read books on them. I tried. What mattered now was, would I read books, especially novels, on the Kindle? The answer is yes.<br /><br />I use the kindle to read novels, look up words in the internal dictionary, make notes in books (especially nonfiction books), extract text from books and documents to place in my notes and e-mails. I use it to wirelessly search Google and Wikipedia. I like the hundreds of thousands of books available from Amazon and the many hundreds of thousands of free books available. To date, I have not used Kindle to check books out of libraries and I haven't used its other than book-reading capabilities such as e-mail.<br /><br />I recently bought a second Kindle for my wife.<br /><br />___<br />Update 11/14/09:<br /><br />I have had two problems of interest. My Kindle rebooted without obvious (to me) cause. It booted to a Main screen containing only the imbedded dictionary; all my content was gone. My content was available from my Archived Items but I'd loose all reading points since I last had Whispernet on. I tried a manual reboot and all my content reappeared along with my reading points, clippings, and the like. Why did Kindle reboot? Don't know. I was reading with my hand holding the upper left corner of the Kindle and my finger may have done something to the power slide switch. <br /><br />Later, I discovered my Back switch worked everywhere except in returning from the dictionary to the page I was reading. Again, a reboot fixed it and the Kindle has functioned flawlessly since then (as in 100% reliable).<br /><br />What I learned: With Kindle, as with so many digital devices, give it a chance to be robust, try rebooting a time or two to fix problems. At least now and then, turn on Whispernet to enable the system to backup your variable data.<br /><br />Do the foregoing problems change my 5-star rating. No. I have trouble with every complex device I integrate into my life. After a while, the device seems to settle down and problems disappear.<br /><br />I added the Kindle app to my iPhone. It works great.<br /><br />I really like my Kindle. I'm reading much more than I had been. Maybe because the Kindle is easier to hold than a book. And... when I go to a place where I may have to wait, I just take the Kindle knowing I have several different books onboard to read.<br />

KINDLE 2 "ROCKS": AN eBOOK READER's ASSESSMENT.
Five INNOVATIVE Stars!! My newest FAVORITE ebook reader!!  I am an avid eBook reader with a large ebook library split between home computers and on-line eBook company bookshelves using four different eBook readers: the original Adobe Reader (and the new Digital Editions), Palm, and eReader systems. So Kindle 2 is revealed as an evolutionary, versatile reader that will solve the old eBook platform problems for the future (those who had ebooks that were 'fenced off' by the original Adobe reader know what I'm talking about) with other features. My first Kindle 2 purchase was "Accountable" by Tavis Smiley and the process was "one click" easy, downloading in 15 seconds (with no computer between me and the book) because my Kindle 2 already 'knew' my Amazon account. And the book reads great. Add to this the wireless delivery of magazines & newspapers and other capabilities such as speech and MP3 music and the attraction was immediate.  So far I'm a happy camper. Here's what I like and dislike among its many capabilities:<br /><br />Pros: <br />* Kindle is an "out of the box" reading-ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log-in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,<br />* 'Easy-on-the-eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink: bright sunlight doesn't 'fade' the reading experience, it enhances it,<br />* it matches 'the eReader/eBook advantage' by having some 'just published' books available at midnight (12:01 PT of each Tuesday's/Thursday's new book publishing day) for immediate download, but it has MORE choices available from Amazon.com, not an intermediary online ebook company with less choices. Plus it's portable: your library is always with you,  <br />* fast downloads with economical costs of many Kindle books that beat other eBooks, Hardcover, and Audiobooks by 1/2 to 1/3rd normal costs: e.g. my first purchase saved me at least $10.00, so the price of Kindle effectively dropped to $349.00 with one purchase, $329.00 with the next, and so on. Savings trump purchase price with Kindle's low book price advantages.<br />* very thin, light-weight, and attractive-looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1,<br />* "Text-to-speech" with auto-page turning, allows 'transitional usage': read at home/office, then listen in the car through built-in speakers or use the headphone jack, then continue reading at home/office. (I love shopping at Wal-Mart for 2 hours with Kindle & earphones in my coat pocket listening to a Danish-accented lady reading a book in English: 2 pleasant, fast hours!! Trust me, normal audiobooks are VERY expensive-try $39 to Kindle's $10 in one case). Audiobooks, however, can be downloaded from sources such as  'Audible.com' (membership required) via computer and placed on Kindle via USB. The volume range of the two internal speakers is excellent. The male/female speaking voices are somewhat stilted in pronunciation, but passable (as I said slightly Danish-accent but the technology will advance in time) even though some words are difficult.  And the listener can adjust the speed of the male/female reader's voice.<br /> * also has wireless access to 'before the newstands' newspapers & magazines (either individually or by subscription), blogs, emailed personal documents, pictures and the web,<br />* It can receive and view e-mailed documents: when I e-mailed a message with 2 attachments (a JPEG and a PNG) from my computer to my Amazon-provided Kindle email address, Kindle displayed them individually on the "Home" list without the email header, just as I needed,<br />* 2 year extended warranty is available, but remember some credit cards automatically double the 1 year    <br />   warranty with purchase,<br />* Previous version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA">Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device</a> ebook purchases can be downloaded free to Kindle 2 & books deleted to free up space are "backed up" at Amazon.com.<br />* Built-in dictionary and web access to Wikipedia and other resource sites,<br />* "Basic Web"-browsing (nothing fancy), "Text-to-speech" (male or female voices), and "Play MP3" are "experimental" prototypes: all three work well and Amazon is collecting comments from owners on their effectiveness. My advice: they are keepers, but the music doesn't automatically loop, as continuous background music to the reader. You must manually restart the music.<br />* The power cord has a USB connector in series behind the power plug head: separate the two pieces of the power plug and the USB mini-plug is revealed for insertion into a computer which will display the "Kindle" folder containing its four sub-folders: "audible", "documents", "music", and "system". "Music" allows putting MP3 music directly on the Kindle. (Thanks to Leo Navoichick for the clarification). And I'm learning more of Kindle 2's capabilities every day through use since I've already bought 5 books, the LA times, and Technology Review magazine.<br /><br />Cons: <br />* Kindle 2 is expensive to buy; memory is not expandable but larger than before, no 2-page capability; no color capability, some rare but pronounced pauses when transitioning on the Whispernet between functions.<br />* could benefit from a hand-held remote page-turning device, but auto page turning is available via the text-to-speech: you can turn down the volume and let Kindle turn the pages. (Thanks to Heather for the info),<br />* an upgrade is needed to "Background Music" to provide continuous music play, instead of a single pass through the music list. Holding the "Alt" key and hitting "space" restarts the music.<br />* the "now-now" answer factory has been discontinued, unfortunately.<br />* does not come with a protective cover, so an owner needs to get one. (Many are available separately)<br />* the newer, larger screen, more expensive "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015TCML0">Kindle DX: Amazon's 9.7" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a>" may or may not suit your needs better: evaluate both.<br />There is little doubt that future Kindle capabilities may include optional back-lighting, a larger screen for two-page capability, and landscape & portrait aspects, but at this point in time thanks to the speedy 3G Whispernet, very diverse high-quality services, and a greatly enhanced Kindle 2 device, it blows the competition away. My Highest Recommendation. Five HUGE Stars!<br />(Kindle 2 reading device, combination battery charger & USB cable (without the usual big power brick), and "getting started" booklet (the full "User's Guide" is on the Kindle device under "Home".)

'...Dragon' on Amphetamines
This is the follow up to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I suggest you read that one first, though this novel is reasonably self-contained.<br /><br />This book opens with Lisbeth Salander enjoying her newly ripped of wealth lazing in a hotel in Granada.  No one knows where she is (as usual), and  back in Sweden, Millenium magazine are preparing a an expose of the sex slave business in Sweden.  The journalist who is preparing the expose is murdered, along with his partner, and Salander's legal guardian.  Salander, now back in Sweden is the prime suspect, and the police hunt is on.<br /><br />To say things get complicated from this point is an understatement.  There are multiple investigations (Salander's of course, the police and Millenium's), multiple suspects, more murders, red herrings galore, and just general mayhem.  Dark as all this is, it is actually quite funny in places: the police have no idea at all what is going on, despite a well meaning and competant detective in charge.<br /><br />This is all tremendous fun for the reader.  It is as anything remotely boring (and probably realism suffers) has been  left out, yet despite the novels sheer page turning ability, (I read this too fast, I will need to read it again), it still has the power to inform.<br /><br />So buy it, read it once, and then read it again.

Better than "Dragon Tattoo," a high-voltage sequel
This is the second in the late Steig Larsson's "Millennium" trilogy. I was so hooked by the first in the series, "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," that I decided to send away to www.amazon.co.uk for this sequel, because I was not willing to wait until July for the U.S. release of an English-language version. These days, the pound has been kicked around as badly as the dollar, so I ended up paying largely what I'd pay in the U.S., and the shipping fee was minimal.<br />I really couldn't wait to crack the 700-page volume to revisit the characters: Mikael Blomqvist, the heroic investigative journalist; Lisbeth Salander, a petite powerhouse afflicted (or gifted) with Asperger's syndrome; Erika Berger, the fearless editor and Blomqvist's sometime bedmate; and the intrepid staff of the magazine, "Millennium." Whereas "Dragon Tattoo" was largely about Blomqvist and his search for a presumed-dead heiress, this sequel focuses squarely on Salander and her difficult adjustment with society. At the end of the first book, she abruptly walks away from the faithless lover Blomqvist. She continues her aversion in "The Girl Who Played with Fire," ignoring him, hanging up on his cell phone calls, tossing out letters, and otherwise pretending he doesn't exist. He's broken her heart and Lisbeth Salander is not one to forgive.<br />However, she soon learns she needs friends--plenty of them--as an ever-tightening noose of danger tightens around her, made up of her evil legal guardian Nils Bjurman, a cadre of nasty social-service doctors and psychiatrists, some rogue cops, members of a Hells-Angels-like motorcycle gang, and a shadowy figure known only as Zala. When one of Blomqvist's best reporters and his wife, are gunned down, police find Salander's fingerprints on the gun and the hunt is on--with the entire police force, plus the host of the other bad guys after her.<br />Larsson keeps the pace breathless throughout the story, which hinges on a seamy sex trafficking trade. Even when he stops to explain what is at stake and how "Millennium" will cover the story, he never slows the movement. You'd think that in a novel of this length there would be myriad subplots, but there really aren't too many threads to follow. Salander's sad past is deconstructed chapter by chapter, and Blomqvist gets to the bottom of police malfeasance and international espionage. But nothing takes the focus off the chase that Salander eludes so brilliantly.<br />I'm sure there are things that a savvy editor could do to tighten Larsson's prose. He adds a love affair too many and drags out the tense ending to a breaking point. Also, it may not seem odd to Swedes, but Larsson's habit of using the last name for every character becomes extremely confusing, because everyone is an Andersson or an Ericsson or a Nilsson. The sameness becomes mind-boggling. It's impossible to even know the gender of the character.<br />I know about this problem personally, for my own grandfather changed his last name because there were too many Nilssons in the army. He chose a name that was a little more distinctive. Larsson could have learned a lesson there. Using a few first names now and then also would solve the problem nicely.<br />But these are nitpicks. I'll be waiting for any news that an English version of the final version of the "Millennium" trilogy is available. These books are just that good.

Second Time Is The Charm
In the first of the series, originally titled in Swedish "Men Who Hated Women", Larsson did a magnificent job in setting up an absolutely unforgettable literary character -- Salander.  Where part one of this trilogy fell short was in the too often sideways plotting, i.e. too many red herrings that added little, too many subplots, plus an inability to avoid multiple endings.  However, in "The Girl Who Played With Fire (and I would love to know what the original Swedish title is), Larsson, in addition to layering depth to Salander's incredibly unique character, at once creating backstory and thus motivation, he also writes (yes, even at 649 pages in the British paperback edition I read), a very tight plot where virtually all the clues, surprises, and discoveries are well earned.  This one is the masterpiece of the two -- so far -- as there is the third and final book to come.  Still, it's necessary -- and no less rewarding -- to read "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo first.  You'll not be disappointed in either.  You'll even learn a bit about Swedish politics, but most importantly about gender politics in the context of a first class literary thriller.

A wild ride
It's a tragedy for world literature that Stieg Larsson is dead, and we'll never have more than three books with Lisbeth Salander as the heroine. She's an absolutely fascinating creation. This is the second book in the series, and every bit as riveting as The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />In the eyes of Sweden's social services system, Salander is a deeply disturbed person who needs a guardian to supervise her and handle all her affairs. But unbeknownst to the authorities, she's a world-class hacker with a photographic memory, brilliant at chess, wildly rich from an Internet coup - and a vicious fighter. For relaxation, she has sex with men or women, as the spirit moves her, and reads books on spherical astronomy and higher mathematics. All this in a very small package: Salander stands less than five feet tall and weighs 90 pounds.<br /><br />The plot of this book is too complex and full of twists and shocks to summarize. But to oversimplify, three people are murdered because of a book two of them are writing about sex trafficking, and Salander, by a quirk of circumstantial evidence, becomes the prime suspect.<br /><br />Salander is in hiding for much of the book, baffling all the cops, well-wishers and thugs looking for her, while doing her own highly irregular detective work. <br /><br />In her twenty-five years of life, Salander has come in for a lot of sexual abuse. But she also has a genius for pay back. Her unique display of brains and aggression is utterly satisfying. <br /><br />The characters in this book are wonderfully drawn, the pace breathtaking and the fight scenes terrific. I can't wait to read the third book in the series.

Lisbeth Salander Takes Charge
In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Lisbeth Salander electrified the story, even though she had a relatively small part in the plot; here, in the second novel of the series, she is given center stage to Blomkvist's secondary role, making The Girl Who Played With Fire much tauter, more exciting than the first book.  Larsson begins to expose what makes Salander tick, and the result gives her character an interesting vulnerability, one that makes her more human and less crazy.<br /><br />But let's get one thing straight;  even with the more humanizing portrait, you would not want to corner Salander in a dark alley.  Nor do you want to give her access to your computer.  She is every bit as gritty and clever as she was in the first, and her stark determination to live by her own moral code drives the plot.  When a journalist working for Blomkvist and Berger and his PhD candidate girlfriend are murdered, it's bad enough, but when those murders are linked to that of Salander's sadomasochistic guardian, Salander becomes the only suspect.  On the lam, she seems to make no attempt to clear her name and instead gets in deeper.  Throw in a "blond giant" (similar in many ways to the albino monk of The DaVinci Code), the seedy underpinnings of the sex trade, and returning characters, and you've got a suspenseful, likable, satisfying thriller. <br /><br />As a pure thriller, The Girl Who Played With Fire is stronger than its predecessor because it has fewer meandering subplots, more unrelenting suspense, and more deftly drawn characters, even if Larsson occasionally resorts to types.  The author seems to have found his  narrative stride with this.  If you liked the first, you'll love the second.  I just hope Larssen's third manuscript was polished enough before he passed away to build on his already finely-tuned skills as a novelist.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

Excellent sequel - better than the first book
Now I say this tentatively, but I do believe this book is better than the first.  There is more action, more suspense, and more intellectual scenarios.  I loved the first book, and gave it a 5 out of 5, and this book did not fail to impress me as much as I'd hoped.  If you enjoyed the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I strongly recommend reading this book.

The Continuing Saga of Lisbeth Salander
This book did not draw me in at first. Having just finished The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I wondered how someone who had not read Tattoo could feel any empathy for Lisbeth Salander, clearly the main character in Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Played With Fire. As the book begins, Salander, 26, is filthy rich (literally, because she stole a fortune from a very dirty man), and she has an affair with a sixteen year old boy. Larsson bores us with details of her IKEA shopping spree and purchase of a luxury apartment. So, for the first hundred pages or so, I though of tossing the book. But it picked up. The last four hundred pages made it all worthwhile. <br /><br />The book pivots off of Salander's involvement in a triple murder. Just how dirty is she? Strong evidence points to her guilt. The police think she is guilty and launch a massive hunt for her. The media spreads stories all over Sweden about her bizarre past.<br /><br />But Salander has friends. There's the resourceful Mikael Blomkvist, star of Tattoo. There's a champion boxer who punches his way into the mix. There's a former guardian who grew to respect her.  There's Miriam Wu, Salander's (part-time) lover.<br /><br />Salander is one of the most intriguing fictional characters that I have encountered. She's a "waif," very short and thin. She's brilliant. She's fierce. She must have total revenge, and she is cold and tough enough to get it. And, at least according to the title, she plays with fire.<br /><br />Other key characters include an evil Russian defector who is shielded by top Swedish officials and a malevolent "blond giant" who can feel no pain. A key plot element is the imminent publication of an expos of sex-trafficking and the johns involved.<br /><br />So, there's a lot going on. Lesser authors could not have drawn it all together. But Larsson does, in a skillful and exciting manner.<br /><br />This book, combined with Tattoo, make it clear to me that the world lost a master wordsmith with Larsson's early death.<br /><br /><br />

Better then the first!
Book 2 in Larsson's trilogy was even better than the first. Book 1 was slow to start while book 2 throws readers into the action in the first pages and then it never slows down. I cannot wait to sink my teeth into book 3! This is a must read if you like thrilling mysteries, strong, intelligent and mysterious female protagonists and characters who continually fight the corruption that invisibly permeates the most powerful institution in the world!

Best I've read this year
I have been anxiously awaiting the sequel and was not disappointed. This is a wonderfully written novel that kept me on my toes from start to finish. Although I suggest reading the first before this one, it does stand alone. I think some of the reasons for relationships might get lost without reading  the book. You might wonder why loyalties fall where they do.<br /><br />I haven't read a better book in quite  a long time. There is a tremendous amount of sexuality, some disturbing used to paint a vivid picture of the main character and of the theme of the novel. There are violent parts but none are graphically described. If you have see a thrilling movie recently, this shouldn't bother you. As in the first one, the author takes his time in the beginning developing a character. In this case, the main character is very unique and quite disturbed. Still, I loved her.<br /><br />I won't give away even one plot twist, there are several other reviewers who have shared that. I will say that the ending fit  story perfectly, I laughed in admiration of the author's perfect lines. He is an excellent writer. I am not sure I can wait for the final one to be translated. Wonder if Amazon has anything on how to learn Swedish. This writing might just make me do it.

LISBETH SALANDER (and Larsson) DID IT AGAIN!
<br />Being a hungry enthusiastic for thrillers, after finishing the great Volume I on the Millennium Trilogy, I, as some of the reviewers displayed on the AMAZON US site, could not wait for the US print on the follow up masterpiece from Stieg Larsson- The Girl who played with Fire- and purchase the UK edition.<br />I might not be a "hard reader" - I read 5 to 10 books a year, but because of this limited time I have for this purpose, I try to be really selective, and believe me, if you are looking for a page-turner, all niter excellent novel, this is the book for you.<br />In my opinion, a good novel has to have several elements to be successful, and Larsson achieves this flawlessly. Good story-telling, simple (at first glance) yet complicated characters, and an "out-of- the-ordinary" plot.  If a novel has these 3 elements on a decent scale, I am caught!<br />In the first installment of this trilogy- The girl with the dragon tattoo- you only begin to know the main characters, Mikael Bloomkist and Lisbeth Salander, and you just have to love the great persona and profile put on both of them.<br />I am a fan of the Camel Club series by David Baldacci, and I found out a lot of similarities on the "slow-but-constant" development and knowledge of "Oliver Stone"- the main character on Baldacci's novels- as well as Lisbeth Salander. These are enigmatic and sometimes surprising characters, but Larsson, as well as Baldacci, know very well the tempo and extension of their creations, therefore a delightful and even-better-than-the-original delivery of a great series. I can hardly wait for the conclusion of this masterpiece. This is a MUST HAVE if you are a thriller aficionado.<br />

Absolutely Fantastic - Even Better Than the First!!
This book was so much fun to read I was crushed when it ended! The first book " The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo" was very good, but it took until the end of the book to really appreciate the whole story. This new book grabs you immediately - I can't wait for the final in this series and I'm very sad there will be no more.

Powerful and Engrossing!
I found this second book, even better than the first which says a lot as I described the first book as spellbinding. The Girl who Played with Fire held my interest from start to finish as it was such a powerful and engrossing story. I find these books very hard to review so bear with me as I don't want to give away the storyline or any spoilers. To me, this is the kind of series that you need to dive into and not know what comes ahead. <br /><br />My favorite storyline and character from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was Lisbeth a twenty-something pierced and tattooed young woman with a horrible past full of secrets. She is intriguing and mysterious and her mind works at a genius level including her computer hacking abilities. In this book, Lisbeth is the focus and the heart of the story as you finally learn much more about her childhood, her family and what her life was like growing up. Her story is haunting and it's amazing that one can survive through such trauma in one lifetime. Mikael a political and financial journalist who runs and co-owns a magazine called Millenium is now tracking a story that exposes the sex trade industry in Sweden. He discovers ties to members of Swedish society, business and even government. When he is closer to exposing this, murder and mystery ensue. Lisbeth is linked to the murders and Mikael is the only one who believes in her innocence. Lisbeth is drawn into this through her own curiosity and hacking skills once again and she is finally forced to confront details from her past. <br /><br />There are definitely disturbing parts to this book as in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo that are graphic and violent in nature so be forewarned if this is something that bothers you. The storyline was so amazing and intelligent that these dark aspects didn't destroy my opinion of the book. As in the first book, there was a lot of violence towards women and it seems excessive. The author tends to focus on human interest stories in which women are dealt with in underhanded and evil ways. I believe that his intent was to bring attention to this issue of the sex trade/trafficking issue as it is a global one. <br /><br /><br />The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third and final book in the Millenium trilogy. It is to be released in paperback in the U.S. at the end of October but it is unclear as to its availability. I am very anxious to read this final book in the trilogy even though I hate to see it end.<br /><br />

the girl who played with fire
I discovered Stieg Larssen when I bought my Kindle.  His first book was a recommended read.  I fell in love with his writing and his characters.  His second book did not disappoint and I did all kinds of searches to find more books by this author.  Only then did I realize he had passed and we were going to be left with only 3 books to enjoy and savor. I recommend these books be read and savored for their uniqueness and quirky characters. I enjoyed the insight into the scandanavian mindset and worldview that is so different from some of our own.  I recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves an officionado of mysteries. It satisfies on many levels and only disappoints in knowing there are only 3 books to enjoy.

riveting second novel
I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo several months ago, and I remember liking it...  but by the time Larsson's second novel became available at my local library, I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed his storytelling style.  The Girl Who Played with Fire picks up a couple of years after the first one left off, incorporating many of the same characters and referring more than once to the plot of the "Wennerstrm affair." While neither Blomkvist or Salander are typical "heroes,"  Larsson imbues them with multidimensionality and complexity not found in your typical "detective" novel.  As an American reader, I found the references to Swedish places and names intriguing but also kind of distracting; I'm sure someone more familiar with Swedish culture would have found additional layers of meaning to the story based on some of the very detailed descriptions the author gives of streets, neighborhoods, and cities.  Larsson also gives an astonishingly detailed account of the technology and furniture encountered by the main characters; Salander's trip to IKEA read almost like an advertisement for the Swedish home goods store.  While I don't typically like this kind of overly descriptive style of writing, Larsson is at least consistent and the details also reinforce the characters' personalities--the reader can infer certain things about a character who uses an iBook rather than a PC.  The plot's twists and turns kept me reading until the end, although I was expecting something a bit more shocking than the actual revelation about Zala (I thought maybe it would turn out to be Palmgren in disguise).  I am looking forward to the third book--which, given the ending, I'm assuming will have to do with Salander's twin sister.

Excellent, but a word of caution before you read this one
I received this on the Kindle the day it came out and finished it very quickly.<br /><br />Three quick thoughts:<br /><br />1. It is excellent.<br />2. No way you should try to read this without having read the first book.  This one gets off to an awkward start trying to bring the new reader up to speed with the events of the first book - it doesn't really work, and there are some things that just have to be read in the original to make any sense (Lisbeth's stolen fortune, her blackmail of Bjurman, her affair with Blomkvist, just to name a few). Consider yourself cautioned.<br />3.  This book paves the way for the next one, leaving a lot open question about who is gonna go to jail, and who is gonna get away with murder, and why.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one; in the meantime,  I'll get more Swedish bleakness and criminality in the Wallender books.

Prepare to be up late...
Steig Larsson was a master storyteller, and we in the US are now just becoming familiar with his incredible talent.  After being gripped by the The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (critical to read before this book), I anxiously waited for the US release of The Girl Who Played with Fire.  This latest allows the reader to get to know the mysterious Lisbeth Salander (from Dragon Tattoo) even better by revealing more of her past that shapes her unique character.  Larsson is a master at creating complex plots, developing characters and making the reader shift gears and perceptions, willingly.  Both books were almost impossible to put down, and seem to soar to top priority on the 'to do' list.  Absolutely riveting!  I understand that the third book (Hornet's Nest) in this Millenium series won't be out until next year... I'm already drumming my fingers in anticipation to see what we learn about Lisbeth next.  But, it is with great sadness that this incredible author's life was cut short, so we'll be sure to savor the last morsels when they are released next year.

Simply marvellous
I promised myself after finishing the first novel in the Millennium trilogy that I would not start this, the second book in the series, until the third was available for purchase. I didn't want to have that vague feeling of bereavement that comes when finishing an utterly engrossing book involving characters that have become familiar and for whom, and this probably sounds ridiculous, it is possible to feel an element of affection. The `good guys', at any rate, are people who, were you to meet them in real life, you feel you would like to get to know better. They are intelligent, sympathetic, motivated, for the most part, by a higher moral code than mere financial gain and supremely competent at what they do, which is getting the bad guys! And all of this is still true of the superficially nihilistic Salander.<br /><br />There are certain structural inconsistencies within this book that might be explained by the author's sudden death and some may find this, shall we say, irritating?  I didn't and contented myself with the thought that the plusses so far outweigh the minuses that it would churlish to gripe!  Larsson's talent in creating these characters and setting them in high tech yet plausible environments is obvious almost from the first paragraph of the first book and is matched by the skill necessary to provide a structure and narrative drive that produces something that truly can be described as `un-put-downable'! Book lovers everywhere should lament the loss of such a rare talent.<br /><br />As you can see, when the temptation is so great, promises are sometimes difficult to keep!

A superb psychological thriller and an expos of the world sex trade!
Mia Johansson, a bright young graduate student, is in the final stages of preparing her doctoral thesis on the controversial topic of sex trafficking. Her journalist boyfriend, Dag Svensson, approaches Mikael Blomkvist, the publisher of Millennium magazine, with the idea of extending this research into a series of articles on sex trafficking in Sweden. Knowing that this kind of expos will reach into the heart of the Russian mafia, white slavery, the exploitation of under-age prostitutes and the sleazy, corrupt lives of some of the best known figures in Sweden's political establishment, Blomkvist jumps on board and throws himself into an investigation that is fraught with danger.<br /><br />Seeking to slake a seemingly endless thirst for computer hacking, Lisbeth Salander, a former researcher for Millennium magazine, randomly trolls through Blomkvist's hard drive and learns of the plans for the upcoming articles. Her memories of a difficult childhood and her disgust for men that would treat young women as little more than commodities and slaves move her to involve herself in the investigation and take justice into her own hands. Her plans for revenge backfire and she soon finds herself charged with three murders. Forced into hiding, she must avoid both the police and those who would kill her to prevent the disclosure of a searing sex scandal.<br /><br />If Lisbeth Salander isn't the most bizarre and off-the-wall literary character ever created, she'd certainly be a front-runner in any ranking. She's a skinny, hard-edged but attractive, on-again off-again feminist; a tattoed punk wild child with bisexual tendencies; an extraordinary computer hacker and skilled journalistic researcher with a photographic memory; a skilled boxer; a survivor of child abuse whose difficult memories of rape and sexual assault have turned into an abiding hatred and a desire for revenge on misognynists; and, last but not least, a multi-millionaire recluse whose desire for privacy would make Howard Hughes look like a party animal.<br /><br />THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is a gutsy, hard-driving psychological thriller with a convoluted plot and a brilliant cast of richly, developed characters. It's a long novel, to be sure, but the writing is so rich, the plot is so deep, the dialogue is so convincing, and the characters are so twisted, that turning the pages deep into the wee hours just seems to happen all by itself. The ending, which is obviously a cliff-hanger intended to leave room for the third novel in the trilogy, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST, is perfect ... it ends this segment of the story with all of the threads perfectly tied up but leaves a reader in the position of desperately wanting to go to the bookstore to pick up the copy of the third novel!<br /><br />While THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE can, of course, be read purely on a surface level as a brilliant thriller, Stieg Larsson clearly had an interest in making a political comment on the sex trade in general. Obviously he wanted to create a vehicle to remind the world not only of the plight of these young women who are being abused but, perhaps more important, of the lack of action and any political will on the part of the world's governments to deal with the issue of human trafficking on an international scale. <br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss<br />

Great new cover - love the new strap!
This new leather cover made by Amazon for the 6" Kindle is the same excellent quality leather as the black leather cover (also made by Amazon) that I have been using for the past year. (I use my Kindle every day and the old cover still looks brand new.)   I especially love the new stretchy strap, as I previously used a thick rubber band to keep my Kindle closed when I travelled with it.  The cover is virtually identical on the inside (same hinge-hook system, gray felt lining).  Another nice feature of the new improved cover:  it is impossible to mistake the back for the front.  I understand that some people opened the older-style cover upside down and backwards and damaged their Kindles.  All in all, this cover is an improvement over the old one.  And I love the new colors, too!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Much better!
The old Kindle 2 cover looked nice, felt well made, and provided reasonable protection from the elements, but it had one big flaw: it had no mechanism to keep the cover securely closed. I often found that if I had my Kindle in my bag and it wasn't packed tight, the cover would open on its own through normal jostling of my bag. Sometimes it would even open the wrong way, and that would bend the hooks which attach the cover to the Kindle. Those bent hooks could cause the Kindle itself to crack -- and thankfully, although my hooks bent, my Kindle didn't crack!<br /><br />The new case adds an elastic band, which keeps the Kindle's cover closed when not in use. It rests in a little groove on the front; when you want to open it, you just pull the band to the side, and it slips behind the body of the Kindle and stays there while you read. When you're done, you slip it back onto the front cover into its groove. Perfect.<br /><br />Bottom line: unlike its predecessor, this case stays closed when you want it to, so it will provide good protection and not suffer from bent hook syndrome. And it still looks great -- especially in the new burgundy red color. A must-have for a new Kindle, and a good upgrade for those of us with the original case.

Great Color!
My new hot pink cover just arrived and I feel like summer found its way to my house a few months early.  Love the color and the strap is very secure.  There's less room around the kindle than there was with the basic black cover so I would say it fits like a glove.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Yep!
Just got the black one. I have an M-Edge Platform cover in 'sapphire'; wanted something a little more grownup in appearance for the commute, since I don't really use my booklight in transit.<br /><br />For my purpose, this is the perfect cover. The overall styling with the pebbled leather gives it a 40's vintage appearance -- grown up and serious, but cool -- not corporate. The cover is pretty rigid. The little channel that holds the strap (which is like a bungee), works well to keep the strap neatly in place. This cover is exactly as I had imagined it would be: except that it's a little more padded, which makes it even better; and it's *very* lightweight. I just threw it onto the not-very-accurate kitchen scale. It weighs about 6-3/8 oz. (180g) -- even lighter than I'd expected; but it's still very slim despite having more padding than I'd expected. It is only very slightly larger in dimensions than the Kindle, and fits the middle pocket of my small messenger bag perfectly.<br /><br />The lining is heathered charcoal, and is more synthetic flannel-like than  suede-like. What's especially good about the color, is that it seems unlikely to show hand-grime over time. I like how it looks with the device, because it's closer in color to the words than it is to the page background.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, it would be difficult to mistake the back for the front. I agree with that statement. This cover does have the same hinge system as the original Amazon cover, and comes with an explicit warning not to lift the back cover. But this design also provides the means of preventing the famous 'evil accident', if one is conscientious about using the strap. The strap holds the cover closed firmly enough that if one does lift the back rather than the front, it doesn't really 'lift' independently; and if desired one can also read with the strap over the 'free' edge of the Kindle. It doesn't interfere with any buttons, and the tab situates perfectly as a place to rest one's thumb, if one happens to hold the device in one's right hand.<br /><br />The *front* cover folds back neatly -- almost like reading without a cover, except that the device won't slide around. <br /><br />The cover does have a strong chemical smell right now, as I expected it probably would coming right out of the box. I expect that to dissipate over time -- it's still quite new. I plan to leave it open to air out for a while and keep my nose *away*. I'm not worried about this.<br /><br />Oh. And -- the packaging it came in is quite nice. I'd call it 'giftable', even. Harmonious with the original Kindle packaging.

Great Improvement!
This cover is SO much better than the original black leather Amazon Kindle cover. First of all, the color is rich looking (I ordered the red) and the leather has a nice "feel" to it. But the best feature is the elastic band that holds the cover closed. This is the one thing that I thought the other cover lacked. Now I'm not afraid that the cover will fall open when I carry my Kindle in my tote bag.

Great New Cover
I'm glad that Amazon updated their original Kindle 2 cover.  The color, I choose Burgandy Red, is vibrant and not tacky.  The addition of the strap is great!  I like that it helps keep the cover closed when I'm not using it, and helps to keep stuff from getting caught in between the cover and the Kindle.  The cover still folds back nicely for ease in reading and the strap will actually assist in this, making it even more stable.  I like that Amazon kept the hinge over the corner elastic tabs.  I've always been careful when opening the cover, so I've never experienced the cracking described by others.  The one change I might make would be to make the cover suitable for the numerous types of lights that are available for the Kindle.  It would be nice to have a light that could be tucked into this cover when traveling or just when you are carrying it around.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Very satisfied
I am very happy with this cover.  I had the previous incarnation, without the strap, and liked it a lot, but was almost daily grabbing the wrong side and running the risk of bending the hooks and/or cracking the Kindle.  The new strap completely solves the issue for me.  <br /><br />Some have complained that the Kindle can still flop when the strap is not in use, but I have found this to be a complete non-issue.  I suppose if you are in the habit of tossing your Kindle around without closing the cover, then this could be a problem, but one that is easily solved by placing the strap directly on the face of the Kindle when the cover is open.  I have to guess this was intended, as the strap is aligned such that it runs exactly midway between the right side buttons and the screen, and hence does not interfere with operation whatsoever.  Personally I won't be doing this, as I prefer have nothing between me and my Kindle, but it's nice to have the option of extra security.<br /><br />The smell was strong out of the box (I have the black one), but after a few days it was almost odorless, unless I put my nose right on it.  The older cover had a softer matte finish that felt good in my hands.  The new one has a heavier shinier finish that doesn't feel quite as nice, but it seems like it will hold up better (my old one was getting a little worn on the corners, after only a couple of months use).  The spine on the new one is quite stiff compared to the old one, and takes a little force to fold back, but it's not really an issue, and I'm sure it will loosen up with use.

Great cover for my new Kindle:-)
I just received this cover with my new Kindle today.<br />I am very pleased with the case and especially like the strap. It keeps the cover closed and I use it to secure the other side of my kindle instead of letting it slip behind the kindle when reading.  I hope this keeps everything secure when it falls off on the pillow by my bed when I fall asleep.  I keep the pillow there to catch my Sony and I hope this works for the Kindle too:-)<br /><br />The cover is a higher quality material than the one I use for my Sony although I like both readers for different reasons..
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Very pleased!
Yes, it stinks right out of the box. But it fades quickly. Day 1: whew!! Day 2: smells like new shoes. Day 3: not really noticeable unless you stick your nose right in it. Just lay the thing open somewhere and let it air out if you're sensitive.<br /><br />I really like the way this cover fits my Kindle so perfectly without excess overhang. Feels sturdy and yet lightweight. Folds back beautifully and can be secured in that position with the elastic cord. And I love the pink color!<br /><br />Like others, I wish it had corner elastic to keep the Kindle from flopping forward, but that probably wasn't possible because it would have needed to be stitched exactly where the outside closure cord is stitched. I like the channel on the front cover that the cord fits into neatly, and I appreciate the little leather tag on the cord because it makes it easy to grab and move the cord around. Seems pretty carefully designed, to me.<br />

Great purchase - exactly what I needed!
I highly recommend buying this Kindle cover for the Kindle 2. Previous versions didn't have a strap to keep it closed, which made me wait to buy one until I would find one that did. This one fits perfectly, doesn't add much bulk to the device and - a nice, probably unintentional bonus - the smell of the leather can really make you think you're reading from a leather-bound book!<br /><br />Having this cover over the Kindle,in my opinion, also makes it more comfortable to curl up and read - the slim device isn't always easy to keep from slipping around and the cover gives you more to hold in your hand. I would suggest buying directly from Amazon their covers are MADE to fit the Kindle, using the built-in hooks.

Great accessory, steep price
This is very nice for what it is. Does exactly what it says. The new leather smell alone is worth it. Although i think the price is abit expensive, but you could argue that you have to pay for the quality. covers the kindle very nicely, it fits in very easily and the leather strap to hold it close does the job more than adequately.<br />Essential piece of kit, to preserve the newness of the kindle2

The strap is a great addition
I originally wanted an Amazon cover for my kindle, but held back due to the reports of the hinges causing cracks.  So when this one came out, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  Yes, the cover does smell right out of the box, but it's been about 3 days now and the smell is getting better and I can hardly tell anymore.   The strap keeps the cover closed and secured.  The cover does not pop open while in my purse, and there's no way you can accidentally open it from the back any longer.  And it feels great in your hands when you're reading.  It lays flat and folds back easily too.  Overall a great product.  Though I might still add some velcro tabs to the back just for extra protection from it popping up while the cover is open.

Absolutely Amazing
I, like many other people, used to dislike Harry Potter. I had never actually read the books, but for some reason looked down on Potter fans, thinking them to be a bit off color. I was certain that the whole thing was highly overrated and that it had been blown way out of proportion (like Twilight). <br /><br />I could not have been more wrong. I finally read the books at the continuous urging of a friend in my junior year of high school, and they have become my favorite books of all time. I have already reread all seven books and stood in line for hours to see the midnight premiere of the newest movie. <br /><br />When is the last time you have read a book and instantly wanted to pick it up and read it again? It doesn't happen often. <br /><br />I can't even begin to tell you how incredible these books are. Not only are they very entertaining, but they are filled with the important themes of good vs. evil, the power of love, and the value of good choices. The characters in this book have become part of my life. <br /><br />If you are at all hesitant to read this series because of its classification as a 'fantasy' series, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. Yes, the book is about wizards and magic, but you would be shocked at how quickly the story pulls you in. <br /><br />I can only ask you to PLEASE read the first book. If you like it, keep reading. If you don't, keep reading. The books get better as they progress, and I feel that the final chapters of the last book are some of the best reading I have ever done. <br /><br />Also, do not judge these books from the movies. Everybody knows that the book is always better than the movie, and it's the same case here. The movies are great, but you need to read the books to fully appreciate what's happening and become a true Potter fan.

Great series.  Great set.
I ordered this set to complement my hardcovers.  I bought and read them all with great anticipation as each was released, but figured having the entire set in paperback would make future readings less cumbersome and more portable for one who is on the go a lot.  Plus the price is good.  Also, there is nothing wrong with the physical quality of the set I received.  I inspected each book and the case closely after reading the first review.  All look good!

We can't stop listening...
When my oldest son was young, I had time to read him each of the books in this collection.  Those of you with multiple children know that time becomes scarce as your family grows.  I really wanted to be able to enjoy these stories with my younger children, but we are so busy.  This audio collection is so amazing.  Not only can I multi-task while we listen in the evening or driving to activities, but the quality of the cd's is fabulous.  The performance by Jim Dale is unbelieveable.  He has so many voices and maintains the integrity of the character throughout 7 books.  My 7 year old keeps jumping ahead of the rest of the family, because he loves them so much.  This is an expensive set of books, but it is well worth it.  This collection is one that you will read or listen to over and over again, so the investment is worth it, in my opinion.  I highly recommend it.

Harry Potter fan
I bought this for myself for Christmas. I received this in 2 days-instead of the predicted 10 days!  It's a great way to drive to work or spend a day off from work when it's cold and drizzling out.  This really helps me escape into harryworld-where I wish I could permanently reside.

Jim Dale is amazing
As an avid fan of the books (my friends and family say I'm addicted, but I can stop anytime I want, I swear) I bought the audiobooks to listen to on my twice daily commute of 45 minutes. Jim Dale is simply superb as he brings all of my favorite characters to life with their own unique voices. Now I can take Harry Potter with me wherever I go without having to lug around those bulky books.

The UK hardcover editions with 'adult' covers
This review is of the UK edition, specifically the Bloomsbury adult's hardcover editions. I got these as part of my HP collection some time ago, and I love them. They are sturdy, and yes, heavy, and have the original British English text. The covers are more 'mature', i.e. without the childish illustrations found on the other Bloomsbury boxed set meant for children. I would suggest shopping around to get the best price.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series is a great book for any child and adult who loves stories about fantasy, magic, and magical beings. The themes of friendship, loyalty, and courage, among many others are sure to endear the book to future generations of readers. The character of Harry Potter matures through the series [as do his two best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger].Harry discovers his true identity, that of a gifted young wizard in the making, and not just a poor unloved orphan, and as the series progresses,harnesses his skills in wizardry to take on the Dark Lord Voldemort. Together with his two new friends, Ron Weasley & Hermione Granger, Harry unearths dark secrets at his school for magic, Hogwarts, and they embark on fascinating, dangerous adventures into a world of magic, good & evil. <br /><br />For those who 'dumb' down this series, I would like to say that I am a serious reader & book collector, a teacher and mother whose reading interests range from classics of literature [Austen, Bronte, Hardy & Dickens] to contemporary fiction and non-fiction, including of course, children's literature, and the Harry Potter series is truly deserving of its place in the annals of children's lit - any series that enthralls and captures the imagination of young and old alike deserves praise!<br />

The best thing to have!
I live in India. My Sister and I are big fan of HP. We both received a gift set of seven books from our parents, a UK edition by Bloomsbury and a US edition by Scholastic. Both reached me in 4 days and 5 days respectively. I must say I liked the UK edition for the Front and Back covers and the language nonetheless, though I admit the US edition is bigger, much better pages, and higher overall quality. I had previously read the UK edition from library, which had the best page quality and I had expected this to be of same quality, but Instead I got that in US edition! also the paper trunk is a good thing to have.<br /><br />Though I am, had been and will be a big fan of HP, and I like both the editions. These are the best gifts we had since years.

An Audiobook Series that Lives Up to the Hype
I was thoroughly impressed by Jim Dale's interpretation of the Harry Potter series.  He has an amazing talent for drawing the audience into the book with his gift for creating character voices. You often forget that you are only listening to a single person reading the book.  Highly recommended!

All Aboard Platform 9 3/4
Harry Potter has done the impossible: he has defeated the Dark Lord, Voldemort, an evil wizard of tremendous power. And he did it before he knew how to walk or talk.<br /><br />Now The Boy Who Lived is ready for his seven-year schooling at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he'll meet new friends and make new enemies on his way to becoming a wizard.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's story became an instant global phenomenon, attracting millions of children and adults from every background. Harry Potter has been translated in over 67 languages, and the last four books were the fastest selling books in history.  Now, with the paperback release of Deathly Hallows, all seven books are available together in a beautiful box illustrated by Mary GrandPr, who also illustrated the books' cover art in the United States.<br /><br />After the disaster that was the 1-6 box set (where some books were missing pages or even entire chapters), some buyers may feel a bit reluctant to buy this set. After receiving my copies, I checked each book and everything appears in order: the covers are in great shape, the box is in great shape, and all the pages appear to be intact (though I could be wrong; I haven't read all seven books just yet). At over $30 off the original price, I would definitely recommend buying this set while this great bargain lasts--I can find this same exact set in stores for over $70.

You get what you pay for
Yes, when I first looked at the listing, the picture showed a box of much better quality.  But, even after the real box was revealed, I still ordered it. Why? Because it's still the least expensive way to get all 7 books in hardback!!  Also, the book covers are made of very heavy duty paper and very nicely bound.  I'm still glad that I purchased the set!!

Great deal for anyone looking to own the hardcovered set!
For anyone looking to purchase the entire Harry Potter collection, this is an incredible bargain!  Imagine, the entire set of Harry Potter novels - in hardcover, no less - not shoved into the mere cardboard sleeve that most other boxed sets are housed in, but placed in a creative cardboard box meant to look like a trunk!  <br /><br />Right now, Amazon is selling this entire collection of books for $116.99 - that's just $16.71 per HARDCOVERED book.  That means you can get each and every Harry Potter novel for less than what you would pay if you were to purchase them separately.  AND, as a bonus, they're housed in a cardboard "trunk" with a little plastic "privacy lock."<br /><br />Anyone who thought this mere $116.99 set was going to be housed in a wooden trunk decorated with gold studs, bound with leather, and lined with the finest velvet, probably also expected it to be delivered by owls.  <br /><br />Basically, if you're like me and want to own and read the entire collection of Harry Potter novels in hardcover for an excellent price, buy this set.  If you already have the entire collection and were thinking of shelling out another 117 bucks for a trunk to put them in, just go to a consignment shop, buy an antique case, put your books inside and slap a padlock on it.  Presto!

Muggletastic
If you haven't read Harry Potter by now stop reading this and order the series. Or go to a library.  The greatest literary publication of this century.<br /><br />This volume was a hardback version of the Queen's English version. That is to say the books published in England that have Anglicized words like neighbour and whatnot.  It made a great gift to a HP fan that didn't have all the books. If you don't mind the investment I'd say go for it.  I've got one and it made a great gift.<br /><br />Enjoy

Yeah, cardboard.  Get over it.
OK, why all the moaning?  I just received this item yesterday for my birthday and I was pleased as punch about it.  Yes, the trunk the books come in is made out of cardboard rather than a fine elder box, lined with dragon hide with a 24 K gold locking mechanism.  So bloody what?<br /><br />As I see it ... this item is a set of seven hardcover books.  These books make up one of the finest pieces of story telling for this generation.  By my calculations, there's roughly 3600 pages of text.  At $200 that's a good price.  Discounted down to $116 is a shockingly good deal.  <br /><br />So why the complaining?<br /><br />If you already have all the books then sure, this is not a purchase that makes sense for you.  On the other hand, if you don't yet have these books in your posession, then I'd have a hard time naming a better deal out there right now.  I've read the series seven times now, in both the american and british versions, love the story to pieces ... but have been primarily grabbing them from the library.  $116 of my good wife's money and voila!  I now own the set.  A good story, good gift, I'm happy.<br /><br />And someday, I hope that a full set will be put out with beautiful leather binding, gold leaf on the pages, all that ... a 20th anniversary set or something like that ... I would totally snatch that up.  But for now, this will do just fine, I'll more than get my money's worth out of it.<br /><br />How about we focus on the actual books themselves, all you who toss out one star?  Yes, let's do that.  As for me, I don't really look at these as seven seperate books.  (Just like Kill Bill vols. 1 and 2 really aren't two seperate movies.)  In my mind, this is one giant tome, one great story, a five star experience from beginning to end.  And if I ever meet Ms. Rowling, I will simply say thanks.

A stunning and thoroughly satisfying conclusion
This is arguably the most "hyped" book in history, and if J.K. Rowling had to sneak down to the kitchen for a glass of red wine to calm her nerves while writing The Goblet of Fire (as she said she did), one wonders what assuaged her while writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The collective breath of tens of millions of readers has been held for two years...and now...was it worth the wait? Did Ms. Rowling live up to the hype? (For that, amongst hundreds of questions, is really the only question that matters.)<br /><br />The answer, most assuredly, is YES.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is told in a strikingly different style than the previous six books - even different from The Half Blood Prince, and, I daresay, it's a better written, better edited, tighter narrative. And while the action is lively and well paced throughout, Rowling found a way to answer most of our questions while introducing new and complex ideas. What fascinated me was this: Some people were right, with regard to who is good, who is bad, who will live, who will die - but almost nobody got the "why" part correct. I truthfully expected an exciting but rather predictable ending, but instead was thrown for a loop. We've known that Rowling is fiendishly clever for years - but I didn't think she was *this* clever.<br /><br />Not since turning the final page of The Return of the King twenty-eight years ago have I felt such a keen sense of loss. My love affair (indeed, everyone's love affair, I imagine) with all things Harry began somewhere in the first three chapters of The Sorcerer's Stone, and has lasted, on this side of the Atlantic, three months shy of nine years. For all that time we have waited and wondered - was Dumbledore right to trust Snape? Will Ron and Hermione get together? What's to become of Ginny and Harry? What really happened on that tower, when Dumbledore was blasted backwards, that "blast" atypical of the Avada Kedavra curse as we've seen it when used throughout the series. So many more questions than those listed here, and so many devilishly well-hidden hints. The answers, as I hinted above, will shock and awe you.<br /><br />When first we met Harry Potter, he was "The Boy Who Lived", with an address of "The Cupboard Under the Stairs". Who could help but bleed sympathy for Harry, treated abysmally - abused, really - by the only blood relatives he had, and forced to live under said stairs by those awful Muggles, the Dursleys? It was a sensationally brilliant introduction, one that ensured that our heartstrings would be plucked and enchanted to sing. He was The Boy Who Lived. <br /><br />Since reading that first book, we have enjoyed Rowling's spry sense of humor - portraits that spoke, stairways that moved at any given moment, Hagrid jinxing Dudley so that a pigs tail grew from his behind, Fred and George's fantastic creations, etc, etc., etc., and more etc's. There was a sense of wonder and magic in Rowling's writing, so thoroughly captivating that the recommended age group of 9-12 in no way resembled the book's actual audience. It was common to see adults walking about with hardcover copies of the latest book, sans dust jacket (to hide the fact that they were reading a "kids" book, I suppose). It was also common to hear of eight year olds sitting down with a seven-hundred-plus page book! By themselves! If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.<br /><br />As for Harry, we admired him. He wasn't afraid to stand up for what he felt was right, even if he found himself in detention for it. He was brutally honest, and immensely courageous and loyal. Harry came to embody, at times, who we would like to be. He wasn't perfect, of course. He suspected Snape of being the one who was after the Sorcerer's Stone, and in The Chamber of Secrets, he thought that Malfoy was the heir of Slytherin. This didn't diminish Harry in our eyes - it made him more human, more real, and even, perhaps, more enviable.<br /><br />Endless fan sites have been erected. For an adult to go to any of them, and find that thirteen year olds are having an easier time parsing out the books plots, subplots, and mysteries, was (for me at least) humbling, but yet also a testament to Rowling herself, and her remarkable creation. She encouraged an entire generation of young readers to read and to think for themselves.<br /><br />But the time has come to say good-bye, for this is truly the end.<br /><br />So good-bye, Harry. Good-bye Hermione, Ron, Professor Dumbledore, *Professor* Snape, Professor McGonagall, Professor Hagrid, Ginny, Fred, George, Neville, Dobby (and all the house elves), even Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. We will miss all of you, every character we encountered, from Muggle to Mudblood to hippogriff and owl, and everything about the world you all so vibrantly inhabit. And to Ms. Rowling: know that you have brought immeasurable joy to millions and millions of Muggles worldwide, and know that we cannot possibly thank you enough. What a tremendous gift you were given. Thank you for sharing it with us.<br />

Nice CD set!
This 17-disc audio version of the final Harry Potter book is a worthy way to experience the story without reading it. It features the rich baritone of narrator Jim Dale, who tells the tale with just the right understated touch, supplying all of the characters' voices. <br /><br />As for Dale's accent, it's appropriately British but not at all too thick. Each word is clear and easy to understand. If you've bought any of the earlier Potter audio CDs you know what to expect: Dale narrated all of those, too. <br /><br />By the way, note that this is an UNABRIDGED audio book. Listening to it all takes 21 hours!<br /><br />The story is dark, and too violent for younger kids, but overall one of the best in the Harry Potter series. Nothing seems forced or thrown together. Author J.K. Rowling wraps up her many plot points and reveals the fates of her characters in ways that almost always surprise you, but afterward seem inevitable.<br /><br />And how she does it is so inventive! Many throwaway moments and whispered remarks from earlier books foreshadow what happens here, and devices that had little importance before, such as Sirius's flying motorcycle, now play key roles. While creating yet another gripping tale, the author also ties her entire epic together with the skill of a true literary master. As a writer myself, I really admire her skill. (Last time I checked, Rowling was outselling me by about, oh, a billion to one.)<br /><br />In addition, the book treats its title character with the complexity he deserves. It portrays the (now) young man as disillusioned, full of doubt, overwhelmed -- a tortured soul who, though a responsible leader in an all-out war, often seems to yearn to do nothing more than sweet-talk Ginny Weasley.<br /><br />Parents should know, however, that this one is a real creepfest, with the most explicitly violent scenes of any book in the series. It's way too brutal for grade schoolers. Also, unlike the earlier Potter tales, the far-reaching vocabulary requires about a 6th-grade education.

For those of us that grew up with Harry...
*SPOILERS: please don't read if you haven't finished the book*<br />After reading the seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter series, as well as many of these reviews, I simply cannot believe that anyone would rate this book with less than 5 stars. I have read reviews where people say that the ending is too "light and fluffy", or that "Harry should have died", and that the whole deathly hallows part of the plot is pointless because, in the end, Harry does not keep the hallows. Can no-one here see why JK Rowling ended the series as she did? I grew up with Harry Potter, the first book having been released when I was about 9 or 10. I cannot express how depressing it would have been had Harry died, for(forgive me for the cheeziness) if Harry had died surely there was no hope for the rest of us. Furthermore, the ending is not "light and fluffy". Harry overcomes Voldemort as his character develops, as he finally understands how to finish the Dark Lord once and for all- as he allows himself to be sacrificed for the benefit of "the greater good". The deathly hallows merely stand as the temptation for Harry to become all-powerful, to make the same mistake that Voldemort and Dumbledore(when he was young) made. His choice to turn down the opportunity to evade death not only speaks on his true character, but sets him apart from those who would try to harness this power. Even if Harry had chosen to keep the Hallows for good purposes, would he not eventually turn into the same type of tyrant as Grindelwald, as Voldemort, and as Dumbledore would have become? Yes, the hallows did appear and disappear in this one book, but because Harry chose NOT to keep them for himself, he chose the path of the pure-hearted. By this action, we truly see how much Harry has grown and matured. We also see just how different Harry really is from Voldemort, a question Harry himself had been wondering for some time. <br /><br />So for those of you that bash this book for not ending in total destruction, and claim that "life is not fair and evil really does win", please remember that life is only what you make of it. Only those of us who grew up with Harry can really say just how much his life means to us, and I would just like to thank JK Rowling for this wonderful finishing piece of the Harry Potter series.

Please deliver to Miss Hermione Granger
Dear Miss Granger, <br /><br />Now that you have completed your seventh year of Hogwarts (I assume you got academic credit for your interesting "internship" hunting Horcruxes and Hallows) and are preparing to join the working world, I am writing to offer you the post of my assistant librarian.  Your conduct in Book 7 of the Harry Potter series has convinced me that you would make a superb Assistant Stern Librarian:<br /><br />Your love of books was never more apparent than when you packed your magical backpack and spent so much time deciding which volumes should be taken along with the tent, clothes and food.  That is just like me packing for vacation.    <br /><br />Your wide reading always seems to save the day--case in point, when a certain otherwise superb wizard did not know the importance of Godrick's Hollow, your knowledge of Bagshott's The History of Magic kept him on the right track.  <br /><br />Your ability to whip up a good dish from scrounged mushrooms shows you can get by on a librarian's salary.  <br /><br />Dumbledore left you a book in his will--and as far as I am concerned that says everything about your mission in life.  <br /><br />As the main Muggle-born character you embody the soul of this series' message of tolerance and you are the one character who NEVER abandons Harry Potter in the Deathly Hallows.  <br /><br />Oh, and slightly off the topic, since you seem to have moved on, could you tell Victor Krum I am a huge fan and give him my number!  Your peer in reading,   <br /><br />The Stern Librarian (I could also use your help with my Silencing Spells).  <br />

A Worthy Mature Finale to a Multi-Layered Series
NOTE: This is a spoiler-free review.<br /><br />The bar of expectation has been set phenomenally high for the last book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Released only a short while after Book 5's movie was released, the last 3 novels are much more dark and mature than the first book, where Harry Potter was but a young boy learning of his magical heritage. Where books 1 and 2 were fine fodder for young children, these later stories are definitely written with teenagers and up in mind.<br /><br />The themes being examined here are quite mature - how government can have mixed motives and can twist the truth, how newspapers can become the voice of the government and feed mis-information for political reasons, how adults that you trust and look up to may have dark pasts and not-so-pure motives. We're past the "simple" issues of revenge and love and into far more complex agendas.<br /><br />Many children's books have clear morals and well defined heroes and enemies - the wicked stepmother, the beautiful fairy. Harry Potter's final tome is far more grey than that. This can be very confusing (and unsettling) for younger children who still need to feel secure in a world where grown-ups can be trusted. For more mature readers, this is a beautiful example of peeling back the layers of the onion to see the underside of life. We began with a very innocent, simple view of the world, naturally coming from the young view of Harry Potter. As he aged and matured, so did our ability to see what was going on around us in the Harry Potter universe - to understand the reason for the actions of his teachers, his friends' parents, and other characters in this multi-leveled universe.<br /><br />With Deathly Hallows, Harry is now an adult. He has turned 17, the coming of age time for wizards. He is no longer safe with his aunt and uncle as a result. He is no longer required to go to school, and can take control of his own actions and path in life. As adult readers know, this is hardly the freedom or release that teenagers often think it will be. With that freedom to rule your own life also comes great responsibility. You are now responsible for how your actions will affect those around you that you care for. Harry's choices are going to have a huge impact on Hermoine and Ron, who valiantly want to stand by their friend.<br /><br />In one sense, Harry has been set on a path by Dumbledore, and you could claim that all that happens is Dumbledore's fault. On the other hand, Harry has free will, and Dumbledore's instructions have always been vague at best. Harry has quite a lot of range of choice in what he does and does not do - and some of those choices are difficult at best.<br /><br />There are meditations here on the meaning of death and life, on the value of sacrifice. Every character has known pain and has made decisions for selfish reasons. There are celebrations of new beginnings, and yes, there are some endings as well. Not to be overly hokey, but there's a reason the "circle of life" cliche shows up so often in fine literature. This imagery has been around since mankind began civilization and it is an integral part of how our society works.<br /><br />People looking for the non-stop comic action of high school hijinx and game competitions will be disappointed. This final novel is nothing like that. In fact, there are long stretches where the characters feel stymied, where it feels like no progress is being made. The book forces you to slow down, to really think about what is going on, to feel the strain and pressure of achieving an extremely difficult goal. Yes, there are action sequences and well described battles - but those are the exception, not the rule. Deathly Hallows is about internal struggles and emotional challenges.<br /><br />The vocabulary reflects this as well. This book is written at a high school level and was not meant to be skimmed or jumped through. The wording and the sentence structure encourage you to go slowly, to contemplate, to think about what is being said. While Harry spends weeks contemplating issues and trying to figure out how he feels about an issue, you, the reader, are encouraged to do the same. It's an avenue of self exploration.<br /><br />At the risk of offending the Harry Potter fanatics, I do want to mention just a few things. I'll do this without spoilers on Amazon and be more clear on my website - on a separate page - for those who have read the book. First, a few sequences in this book felt very much deus ex machina. Yes, explanations are provided later in the book, but the same things could have been arranged in a much more probable manner. The way certain sequences run, it's almost as if she had Chapter X and Chapter Y and then had to figure out some way to connect them. Next, certain key character's personalities change in leaps without that development being shown. We have developed such a connection with those characters over the years that it would have been wonderful to see that maturation, but instead it just seems to "happen".<br /><br />Still, as I mentioned at the beginning, the bar was set exceedingly high for this book. It was expected to be exactly perfect, a stunning work of literature appropriate for every age group. It was expected to satisfy both those who wanted a Hollywood Ending as well as those who feel realism requires death, destruction and bleak despair. While it is not going to achieve all of those goals - really, can any single book do that? - it is an extremely good read which has exposed millions of people to questions and issues they might not have otherwise encountered. It encourages those people to think - critically - about the world they live in. And really, you cannot ask any book to do much more than that.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Jim Dale makes this book come alive!
I have been a firm believer since book one that the best way to enjoy Harry Potter is to listen to it on audiobooks.  Wow does Jim Dale do an amazing job - again!  How he is able to do the voices of over a hundred characters and make them each distinguishable, I do not know.  The audiobooks sucks you in from the very first chapter.  I feel like I'm there with the characters in the books listening in on private conversations.  If you're going to live the Harry Potter experience, I highly recommend going with the audio books.

A fitting end to a wonderful journey
This work was a simply beautiful end to Ms. Rowling's extraordinary series.  What a pleasure it was to read a such a fine, wonderful series and to know that I may one day share it with my children--who will then hopefully share it with theirs and on and on.  What Ms. Rowling created is a work that deserves to endure, that deserves to be cherished by generation after generation.  Ms. Rowling should be heartily proud of the work to which she devoted so much of her life, so much of her time, and so much of her passion.  She has created something truly, truly special.  <br /><br />I will not summarize the book's events in this review because everyone deserves to experience the pleasures of unraveling them one by one on his or her own.  What I do want to do is address the things that made this book--and the series as a whole--a work that stands out from the crowd.  <br /><br />The thing I admire most about this series is Ms. Rowling's emphasis on love.  This book brought about the conclusion of that theme and created a shining of example of what can be accomplished through love.  Love transcends race and time, love transforms Rowling's world and makes it the beautiful place it is.  It is through one act of love after another that various characters are redeemed and made heroic.  <br /><br />I was also very impressed with how Ms. Rowling handled the theme of morality.  Her world is shades of gray and that ambiguity gives her works a note of utmost authenticity.  In this book Harry learns that Dumbledore, his great mentor and father figure, was also a very human being who allowed pride and greed and ambition to lead to some very grave mistakes.  The Malfoys also learn an extremely painful lesson about the costs of one's actions and the moral choices one makes.  It is in the constant struggle to define what is moral and what is not that Harry grows and matures.  It is his discovery that even the best among us sometimes do things that we deeply regret that brings him to a greater understanding of human nature.  <br /><br />I don't doubt that there will be many who disagree with me but I also liked how Ms. Rowling dealt with death in the series and in this book in particular.  The loss of beloved characters is very difficult but I think that Ms. Rowling uses those losses to make a clear statement that doing what is right often comes at a very dear cost.  I also really love the way she makes clear that every life is precious and it is this understanding of the precious nature of life that leads some characters to save those whom the less forgiving might write off as expendable.  It's easy to wish for vengeance and quite another thing to allow others the chance for redemption.  <br /><br />In the end, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction for a series to which I have devoted a great deal of my life.  In many ways, I grew along with Harry and his friends and now that their story has come to a conclusion, I feel a great deal of gratitude and admiration toward Ms. Rowling.  I will never cease to be glad that she shared her vision with us, that she introduced us to the wonders of a new world, that she never let us forget that sometimes doing the right thing is infinitely more painful than doing what is easy, and that love can and will conquer all.  Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for sharing your gift with us and thank you for providing me with a series that I will treasure and that I will someday delight in sharing with my own child so that she too can experience the wonder of your creation.

Spoilers Galore; My Review.
Half-Blood Prince is easily one of the better books in the Harry Potter series, though each is a masterpiece. But the 6th installment of a 7-part series is bound to be full of great moments in the story. There remains a great deal unanswered in this book, however, and the 7th will surely need to be no smaller than an average encyclopedia. Somehow as I was reading this book, I felt that I was learning more and at a quicker rate than in Order of the Phoenix, but so many of Harry's problems and questions took so long to reach any sort of answer or resolution that I still ended up not knowing many of the secrets I expected to be revealed in this book. It must be that Rowling, in her grand scheme, is saving much for the last book. One thing seems to be for certain, though, and that is that Rowling will never lose that special touch, that supreme and genuine interest in the story and its characters that makes the writing so engrossing. After completing this book, I was in a state of total shock and to this moment I wish only to read the seventh book. <br /><br />Half-Blood Prince is dark; I mean far darker than the last. This is the time I have always known was inevitable in the Harry Potter world, at last we are seeing chaos and war and battles break out within the walls of Hogwarts itself. Several of the chapters are particularly well-written, with great suspense and imagery; an example would be the time Harry and Dumbledore spent in the cave. Relationships blossom in this book at last, including Harry suddenly falling in `love' with Ginny Weasley, Ron dating Lavender Brown, Pansy and Draco clearly going out, and some serious hinting at a possible romance between Ron and Hermione when he gets rid of Lavender. Some of the focus on their teenage jealousies and squabbles, and their newfound interest in dating and `snogging,' was a cute touch, but admittedly not what I was exactly looking for. After all, it was more fluff than anything else, and certainly none of it was real love. Then, the useless couple of Tonks and Lupin was introduced in the end; all well and good, I suppose, but again not something that overjoyed me. The end of the book is very sad indeed, yet, I was not crying--I was merely shocked, flabbergasted at the circumstances. A Snapeless, Dumbledoreless Hogwarts that Harry Potter is not intending to return to next year? Yes, you heard right. Harry wants to go off and find all of Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes and face the final battle on his own. <br /><br />Much of the book is devoted to Harry witnessing important memories in the Pensieve with Dumbledore so that he can gain a greater understanding of his enemy, the Dark Lord. Now, I have long been a fan of Severus Snape. I admit I love him. Most of my reasons for loving Harry Potter center on him. And while much was learned about him in this book, much is still unknown, and what we do now know is shocking. To begin with, we learn the names of his parents, muggle Tobias Snape and witch Eileen Prince (yes, Snape is the Half-Blood Prince.) It is also known that Snape overheard the prophecy regarding Harry & Voldemort and told the Dark Lord about it; however, supposedly he showed enough remorse after Voldemort used the information to kill Harry's parents that Dumbledore forgave and entrusted him. Many are accusing Dumbledore of naivety for this, but I believe that they are only looking at what is plainly on the surface of this book and forgetting many things. I will explain later why, amazing as it may seem, my love for and faith in Snape remain unshaken despite the fact that this book, from its beginning, seems to be saying that he is still on Voldemort's side. I believe it's too simple for Rowling to be writing that he is, after all, evil. To me it seems a set-up. Additionally, I was expecting a surprising reason for Dumbledore to trust Snape, not a simple apology. There must still be more to this than meets the eye. <br /><br />Before I explain my case about Snape, I'll mention some of the things that remain a mystery after this book. Sev's patronus and greatest fear don't come up (in fact, while Tonks' patronus is revealed, Boggarts don't receive any mention.) Some interesting information is supposedly going to be divulged regarding both Lily and Petunia, but neither of them played much of a role in book 6. <br /><br />So on to my favorite character, who ends up being the Prince mentioned in the title. When I first finished this book, I was somewhat upset because while I still loved Snape, I was aware that what he'd just done was not steering in the direction of redemption, as I had hoped to see him going. I also knew that, at least until some point in Book 7, almost everyone (in the books and in real life) would turn against Snape and regard him as a treacherous dog. Yet, after composing myself and reviewing what I'd read, I realized that I just cannot accept him as truly evil, or Dumbledore as an old fool. <br /><br />Now, before reading this book, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen...Snape killing the Headmaster and fleeing the school with a bunch of Death Eaters, would have been right at the top of the list. But, I'd have been wrong. I had a very strong feeling that Dumbledore would be the one to die in this book. But I never saw the way it happened coming. In the beginning of the story, Snape came in rather quickly. Once Harry was at school, Snape finally got the Defense Against the Dark Arts post he'd longed for. I was cheering. (Yes, he is no longer Potions Master.) But it turned out not to matter. In the second chapter, Narcissa Malfoy and her sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, visit the home of Sev and he makes with Narcissa (possibly out of love) an Unbreakable Vow--that Snape will help her son Draco carry out a task ordered of him by Voldemort, and will complete it himself should Draco prove unable. The task, it seems in the end, was to kill Dumbledore. Draco does prove unable, and Snape carries it out. Yet, it cannot be this simple. Dumbledore may have been aware of the task, and the Vow. From the moment Dumbledore returns from the cave, weakened, having drunk an unknown potion set by Voldemort to guard a Horcrux, he says he needs Severus. He never says what for, never asks to be healed. When Snape arrives Dumbledore calls his name and says 'please' (pleading for his life, as everyone assumes, or something else?) before Snape aims the curse at him that kills him. <br /><br />This seems twisted, monstrous, unforgivable, no? Exactly: No. Not in my opinion, at least. I do not think it was Snape's choice to kill Dumbledore, but that the Headmaster had at least one reason for telling him that he must do this horrible deed. Of course from Harry's perspective (Harry, who has inherited, as Lupin says, a prejudice against Sev) it was cold-blooded murder and betrayal and he now wants to destroy Snape as much as Voldemort. But this too is far too simple; clearly, as the book ends on this note, there are things Harry does not understand about what has happened. <br />He has forgotten, for instance, about the argument overheard by Hagrid, between Snape and Dumbledore. This point never was addressed again, yet amidst all the turmoil, who can blame it for being overlooked? Consider it. Dumbledore telling Snape he must do something that Snape does not wish to do. For several reasons I can think of (mainly involving the Death Eaters and the Malfoys), this argument connects directly to the death of Albus. And what of the mysterious order given Snape at the end of "Goblet of Fire," at which he turned pale? Clearly he is being asked to do things most difficult, to make great sacrifices; how can the most enigmatic person turn out to be clear-cut evil?<br />Read carefully and you'll see that Snape has hatred and revulsion etched into his face when he performs the fatal Avada Kedavra. I see these emotions not as directed at his target, which Harry naturally assumes, but stemming from the act he is about to commit. It never really occurs to Harry that Sev may have been feeling the same things he'd been feeling when he was bound by his promise to force-feed the convulsing Dumbledore, does it? Probably far worse.   <br />Snape acts rather outrageously for the remainder of his time in the story, not shockingly, yet he refuses to allow any harm to come to Harry (clearly Dumbledore would've wanted that). He seems to be in pain and becomes furious at the mere suggestion that he is a coward--because he has just done the most difficult and least cowardly thing ever asked of him. Dumbledore has repeatedly stated that Harry's life is more important than his own, and that Harry understands less than he. And the facts remain that he has in the past done much good despite his suspicious nature, & that not everything he told Bellatrix about staying loyal to Voldemort can be true. My final point has to do with the words Dumbledore cried while drinking the potion in the cave. I don't know why, but I feel these words are important, and that after the escapade Dumbledore may have known the end was near. <br /><br />Thus I rest my case. Avid Harry Potter readers will want to dive into this one, I'm certain, and those who haven't yet discovered it should do so. Only possible complaints? 1) Too short; 2) Not enough anticipated answers given, yet new questions raised, 3) Disturbing ending leaves you frustrated waiting for the next book.

Battled rain and cold weather to get hold of it  :)
I'm one of those who couldn't wait until the morning to get hold of this book. I literally battled rain and cold weather with my sister to get our copies at 12.15 am, July 16, in a local bookstore in Argentina. According to my dad, I'm slightly nuts for doing that :) <br /><br />In my opinion, though, this book was well-worth the extra effort. After picking it up, I returned to my house and started to read it. I just finished it, and I can sincerely say that it is simply outstandingly good. Yes, the other books were awesome too, specially the 4th and the 5th, but I think that Harry's world is becoming more defined with each book, and that makes for a thoroughly engaging reading experience.<br /><br />What is new in this book?. Well, after having to come to face with the fact that Lord Voldemort is alive, the wizard community is in an uproar, and quite frightened. Cornelius Fudge has been sacked as Minister of Magic, and an Auror has been named in that position. Harry, Ron and Hermione get their O.W.Ls (Ordinary Wizardry Levels), and have to decide what courses to take for their N.E.W.Ts (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), something that will define their future careers. Plots abound, and danger is omnipresent throughout the book. There is a new teacher of Defense against the Dark Arts, and also an eccentric new Potions' teacher. Of course, there is much more, including a death that I bet will make you cry, and that hurts Harry enormously. I won't tell you who dies, only that the event involves the Half-Blood Prince, and that I think it was a sacrifice rather than a murder. <br /><br />But what's the point of telling you all this if you can read the book, and enjoy it as much as I did?. Suffice it to say that this is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter series. There is adventure, some romance, and many more elements that add up to make the kind of book that you simply must read. And now, after staying up all night in order to read this book, I really need to catch up on my sleep. If you haven't guessed my opinion on "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" yet, I'll say that I highly recommend it. Run to get your copy, if you don't already have one, and share the magic :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat

Great book, but parents beware!
Book 6 is another wonderfully told story from J.K. Rowling.  She truly has a gift for creating an entire world in our imaginations.  As I read each page, however, I became more and more concerned about all the young children who stood on line with me when I purchased the book.  I had thought it was clear from books 4 and 5 that the series was becoming increasingly darker and more mature in its content.  I think we had to know that Cedric's death in book 4 was just the beginning, and Sirius' death in book 5 was ceratainly not the end.  Book 6 not only has more death, but is almost entirely about teenage relationships.  Parents who think that these are "children's books" are much mistaken and may face some unexpected questions from their youngsters.  As with any movie, book, CD, etc., any parent must preview the material before allowing a child to have it.  You'll see right on the Amazon description that the reading level is ages 9-12.  That may be the level from a literacy standpoint, but the content is FAR more mature than that.<br /><br />I loved this book, and like millions of other people I am already speculating about book 7, but my suggestion is that no child under 14 read it.

When's the next one coming out?
For me, the engine that has moved the plot through the entire series has been the question of whether Snape is evil or just hateful.  This is the crux of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  All the evidence we have points to the former.  But ... how much do you trust Dumbledore's judgement?  If he was wrong about Snape, it throws into question his conviction that love is more powerful than evil.  On the other hand, Dumbledore tells Harry that, as he is a lot smarter than the average wizard, his mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.  Can you swallow a mistake that huge?<br /><br />In many ways I like this book the best of the series.  It feels a lot leaner (and is a lot shorter) than the previous two because J.K. Rowling has dispensed with the subplots that were so entertaining/extraneous.  The battle lines are clearly drawn, and the atmosphere in the wizarding world is post-9/11 Washington:  shell-shocked, anxious, with many official attempts to appear to be managing a mostly invisible threat.  Harry's personal life, however, has gotten a lot better.  He's been largely freed from the familiar sources of persecution, and he's getting the respect he's earned from teachers, students, and even the press.  He and his friends have the increased freedom and independence you would expect for sixteen-year-olds;  many of the few lighter moments come during the wizarding equivalent of driver's ed.  <br /><br />If you're inclined toward the philosophical, you'll find grist for your mill in this book.  If you're not, you'll just gulp it down as fast as you can and then wish for more.

Harry Potter mirrors our own dark world
I've just finished reading the latest installment of the Harry Potter chronicles.  My chest feels as though my heart has been torn out from the book's tragic ending as I sit here typing, hopelessly admiring the tactic Rowling used to achieve her greatest success to date in this much loved children's book series.<br /><br />Children and adults who read this book alike will be left reeling in its aftermath.  As an adult I was first attracted to the Harry Potter series quite inadvertently.  I had adamantly refused to read any of the three Harry Potter books published at the time until I was required to in college in my children's literature class.  Almost instantly I was spellbound by Rowling's nostalgic narrative.  Children of course (and quite a few adults as well) delighted in the fantasy and Harry's and friends' magical misadventures.  However, I think much more alluring to adults is how Rowling's writing somehow manages to transport us in time to a much simpler, secure, and magical era in our own lives.<br /><br />But in her latest achievement Rowling departed from her usual safe, magical, nostalgic atmosphere, instead embracing all too real themes prominent in the world at large.  The opening chapter in her book portrays the muggle world hopelessly searching for answers to inexplicable acts of terrorism.  In doing so, she has effectively raised the stakes in this book.  No longer is it just the wizarding community in danger, but ours as well.  It seems the ever present daily fear that magical characters live with is a very familiar echo of own terrorist fueled anxiety in this perilous new world we live in.  <br /><br />Gone is mystery obscuring Voldermort, who until this book, moved quietly(with a few notable exceptions) in the shadows of uncertainty and doubt.  Every witch and wizard alive now knows Voldermort is back and that they all are in "mortal peril".  Potter and Dumbledore themselves take further steps to pierce the veil of mystery that has always opaqued this character.  Acting very much like FBI profilers the two reconstruct recollections of Voldermort's past, uncovering the truth about how a modest muggle born Tom Riddle became the scourge of the wizarding world, with unimaginable consequences for both.<br /><br />Perhaps the darkest (and most beautifully poignant) aspect of this novel is the way she strips Potter himself of callow illusions of safety.  In the first book Potter's mother had imparted some magical shield to him through her death at Lord Voldermort's hands.  Indeed all Potter had to do to vanquish the Voldermort specter was touch him.  Even when Voldermert was resurrected in the flesh in later books, Potter still had layers of protection consisting of members of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore himself.  But in this book every ounce of protection once had, whether real or imagined, is stolen from him, in one fateful moment atop Hogwort's castle.  The ultimate irony of this scene is that it is Dumbledore's trusting optimism, in which Potter found some sort of emotional respite in earlier books, which tragically leaves Potter very much alone.  By the end of this emotional epic Potter has become a man, abandoning all desperate hopes of shirking his final confrontation with his arch nemesis and accepts his destiny with ironclad determination.  For adults, Rowling has successfully tapped into our own memory of whatever tragedy or trauma caused us to cease to believe in magic and forget childish illusions of security in our own lives.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is completing lacking in humor or the lighthearted moments we have come to expect from Rowling's writing, this book seems to be an effective amalgam of both.  From family squabbles over Christmas dinner to hormonal teenagers taking lusty refuge in each other's arms in darkened classrooms or abandoned hallways this book had more than enough comical highlights.  Ron and Hermione in their mature(or lack of it) relationship provide a great deal of humor in this novel.<br /><br />However great this story might be or how well it sets the stage for the final epic showdown, this book may not be for everyone.  It seems that Rowling is writing for adults or at least the children (now teenagers) that read the first book in the series when it was originally published.  The vocabulary that Rowling uses is quite extensive and one should be prepared to have a dictionary on hand to discern the full meaning out of certain passages.  Furthermore, as the characters have grown up so too have the series themes matured.  Our teenage protagonists are now involved with romantic rivalries, rebelliousness, and quite a bit of making out.  As mentioned before the themes and mechanisms Rowling utilizes in her writing may be too mature for younger readers.  While this book will surly present hours of enjoyable entertainment to adults, parents would be well advised to wait for the eager younger readers to be a bit older before presenting with this wonderfully written all too real fantasy masterpiece.  <br />

Heartbreaking and fabulous
What an incredible book!<br /><br />I don't know where to begin. Let's begin at the beginning, shall we? "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" opens with an amusing scene with the "Other Minister," who is actually the Prime Minister of England, being visited by the new Minister of Magic. I just pictured Tony Blair the entire time, especially when he was lamenting over an impending phone call from that "wretched" man who was the president of a powerful yet unnamed country...J.K. Rowling certainly has a sense of humor!<br /><br />Let's get back to the main story. Lord Voldemort's followers are gaining power, and people everywhere (wizards and Muggles alike) are in danger. In order to help Harry learn as much as possible about the history of the Dark Lord, Professor Dumbledore enlists in the help of his pensieve to take Harry back in time to the days when Tom Riddle was just a young man. Harry eventually embarks on a journey to help his professor find four missing Horcruxes, which are magical objects in which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has extracted parts of his soul in order to secure immortality.<br /><br />There are many additional developments in this novel, too. The sixth-year students all receive the results of their O.W.L.S. over the summer, and they become more focused on the intensive classes that will prepare them for their N.E.W.T. exams the following year. Harry comes across a mysterious potions textbook that is marked as the property of the Half-Blood Prince. The book contains a bunch of shortcuts that make potion-making a breeze for Harry, but the identity of its previous owner remains a mystery, and Harry eventually gets more than he bargained for when one of the Prince's spells goes awry. <br /><br />Hogwarts students receive a new Potions instructor when Professor Snape takes over as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...a move that has Harry and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, absolutely befuddled. Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis, has been acting very strange all year. Harry believes that Draco has joined legions with the Death Eaters and is planning some sort of attack on the school, but there's no real evidence to support that theory, and Harry has a hard time getting anyone to believe him. There is also romance in the air at Hogwarts...love potions become very popular, and new couples are formed, some of which are better pairings than others. Harry finally chooses the girl that he was meant to be with from day one, but Ron makes an arse out of himself for the majority of the book, which is painful but also quite humorous (I know he'll set things right in Book Seven!).<br /><br />The novel becomes darker and more somber as it progresses. There are many more deaths in "Half-Blood Prince" than any of the previous Potter novels...and that's saying a lot! Someone is bewitching objects and launching attacks on Hogwarts students...one of the most popular characters becomes gravely ill as a result of drinking a poisoned beverage. When Dumbledore and Harry set off on their climactic quest at the end of the book, the horrors they encounter are too gruesome to put in words. Young readers will ultimately be disturbed by what they read. (I'm a 25-year-old reader, and I'll probably be having nightmares for weeks! Seriously, when it comes time for "Order of the Phoenix" and "Half-Blood Prince" to be made into movies, I don't see how Warner Brothers will manage to avoid "R" ratings.)<br /><br />Ultimately, the end of this novel is the most tragic and heartbreaking of any book in the series so far. It was also the most shocking. Personally, I had a feeling that I knew which character was going to die...it made sense to me that Harry would need to go into Book Seven as utterly alone as possible, and Rowling set it up so that's exactly what will happen. However, I was absolutely stunned when the final death took place, and that's all because of the second chapter of the book, when Snape meets with Bellatrix and Narcissa and pledges an Unbreakable Vow. Now, I have always had a soft spot in my heart for Snape. (I think it's partially because I adore Alan Rickman, but I see now that my logic was incredibly stupid...this is a book, not a movie!) I always thought that there was something very important about Snape that readers were not privy to, and that the information would somehow redeem him. I also thought that since Dumbledore was such a great wizard, he was right in placing so much trust in Snape. I always thought that Snape really was a loyal member of the Order, and that he was putting himself at great risk by maintaining ties with the Death Eaters. <br /><br />When Snape pledged the Unbreakable Vow to Narcissa, I had a feeling that he had majorly done himself in, and that he would be totally screwed over in the end, especially since it is revealed later in the book that people who break Unbreakable Vows die. Well...I don't want to spoil things by saying more than I already have, but things did not work out exactly as I had thought. Regardless of what I have ever thought about Snape, I never expected that he would behave the way he did at the end of the book. I was absolutely stunned. BUT...it will be interesting to see what happens in Book Seven. The reason Dumbledore finally gives for trusting Snape is incredibly flimsy...perhaps there's something more to it than meets the eye...maybe Snape actually proved himself to be the most loyal member of the Order by carrying out Dumbledore's orders at the end! I have no idea how that theory will play out, but it's just an idea...with J.K. Rowling, anything is possible. We will see!<br /><br />The end of the book is unbelievably sad and depressing. It made me cry even though I saw the whole thing coming. I don't think I've been that sad since the spider died at the end of "Charlotte's Web".<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" is amazing. It is mature and moving and is by far the best book in the series so far. There are a lot of open-ended questions that are leading up to Book Seven...will Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts for their final year? Will there even be a Hogwarts to go back to? How on earth will Harry manage the impossible task that lies ahead of him? One thing's for certain...I can't wait to find out!

Incredible!
This is my favorite book of the Harry Potter series, just ahead of the Goblet of Fire.  It caught my interest from the very beginning, in the middle of the summer when Harry is at the Dursley's, which most of the other books did not do.  After the first chapter, it was very hard to put down!  I even ignored the phone ringing several times while I was reading.  <br /><br />Many questions of why and how that I had from previous books were answered in this one.  The story falls together almost perfectly in my opinion, with the exception of a few questions I had concerning the prophecy and it's importance. The only downside to the book was the sad ending during which, as the reviewer above mentioned, I almost cried.  That heartbreaking incident creates a different feeling than was had through the books when Harry was younger.  The mood is darker, and as he gets older, Harry becomes more independent, slowly seperating from Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore (especially in the end), and Hagrid for fear of Voldemort using them to manipulate Harry.  <br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who has read the first 5 books of the series

Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince
You ask if I am over 13. Heck, I am over sixty-seven.<br />What a delightful romp through a very sensitive portrayal of school life, despite the witch- and warlock-craft. I am told that American pubishers have finally stopped translating these volumes into a language that our American schoolchildren can understand, and that's nice, because a little exposure to something other than our culture won't damage them permanently. Exposure to failure is also a positive learning experience, as is the death of Dumbledore, if he is in fact dead.<br />Well and bravely done. I hate to admit it, but my life may be a little emptier without another chapter to read tonight.<br />Mac

EXCELLENTUS WONDIFERUS! Harry Potter Has Us Under His Spell!
Many stories have striven to catch the minds of its readers, or its listeners for that matter.  From the beginning of time people have made daring attempts at concocting amusing and diverting tales, but J.K. Rowling has spun a most convincing story.  Since the introduction of Harry Potter  to the public, thousands upon thousands, undoubtedly millions, of every  race, age, and religion, have fallen under his spell.  After reading the  fourth, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Finished it in less than three  days; I couldn't put it down!), I have to let it be know that Ms. Rowling  does not disappoint.     As every preceding Potter book starts off, the  newest is no different:  Harry is staying with his insufferable relatives,  the Dursleys.  And as always, he has found a new, more creative and  exciting means of shortening his summer stay with his Aunt, Uncle, and  cousin.     Trouble invariably manages to find Harry, even at his seemingly  secure refuge.  Lord Volde-- oh, goodness, excuse me!--  he-who-must-not-be-named is at his strongest, and Harry is facing greater  risk than ever before.     This is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, and he  is now fourteen years old.  So along with life-threatening situations,  almost losing a best friend, meeting new foes, dealing with old ones-  namely Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and managing to get most of his  homework done, Potter must also deal with the anguish and misery of being a  teenager.  Take it from me, I'm seventeen years old, and it's hard for me  to believe that J.K. Rowling hasn't just experienced the cruelty of peers  and at the same time, the exciting prospects that come with the whole  &quot;Being a Teen&quot; package.     Fearing that I might give too much  away, I'll leave you with this tidbit:  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll  learn how to pronounce Hermione, but most importantly, you'll want to read  more, and become a better person because of it.

At last
What can I say about such an overly hyped book as this?  Only that is was well worth the wait!  For all of you who have never read any of the Potter books (could there really be people who haven't read at least one?) think  of these books as a series of magical mysteries.<p>It's life as usual for  Harry at the beginning of the book, which has him spending yet another  dreadful summer with his hateful guardians, the Dursleys.  (Imagine Dudley  Dursley on a diet!  Try saying that 3 times fast...)   Things pick up when  Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the Weasleys.  And life at  Hogwarts is as interesting (and occasionally dangerous) as always with it's  oddball assortment of students and professors.   Naturally, there is a new  Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (my but they do keep going through  them, don't they?)  Along the way, we will learn about other schools like  Hogwarts (it's about time!)   And a new villain - or should I say  villainess - is introduced. Someone who definately keeps Harry on his toes.   All the while Harry and his 2 best friends, Ron and Hermione, become  entangled with the mystery of The Goblet of Fire....<p>With characteristic  abandon, Rowling creates familiar  busy backdrop for Harry and friends as  she pushes him through a series of terrifying encounters, the usual  mischief and mayhem, new revelations (and, of course, rousing games of  Quidditch) <p>It's delightful to see how Rowling can stay true to the feel  of the previous books, and yet allow Harry and friends to mature (ex: As  the kids are officially teenagers now, hormones will kick in for Harry, Ron  and Hermione... but they all fall in love with the wrong people!   Harry  especially has some difficulties in this area.)<p>Be prepared: this is a  darker book than the first 3.  Some well known characters die -- one of  whom is well liked by readers.  The ending of the book is frightening  compaired to the previos books but is a necessary evil for Harry as the  older he gets, the more he learns about his past.  JK Rowling has stated  that each new book gets progressively darker so as to  tie in with the  overall plot.  <p>As always she writes with a deft touch.  This deliciously  suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping and imaginative as the previous  books -- full of unexpected twists and turns.  A delight to be savored,  especially you are, like me, already awaiting the next one.

A Step Above the Others
I had read the first 3 novels In the Harry Potter series and had found them extremely enjoyable page turners, Rowling creates a complete, magical  world and her characters are always perfectly developed: You cheer when  Harry stands up to Snape, You scowl inside when Malfoy turns up and you  feel safe and secure when Dumbledore's around.  But quite simply, the  extrodinary and sensational &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire&quot;  leaves the previous books In the dust.  From the opening chapter you  realise this Isn't going to be your average Harry Potter book, a character  suspected of murder Is himself murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort.  I  had always felt a Harry potter novel didn't get exciting until the story  reached Hogwarts, this time Harry, Ron and Hermione travel to see a  Qudditch World Cup which doesen't leave you dosing off waiting for the  Hogwarts Express.  But from then on the pace becomes consistently quicker,  Harry's name Is put In a &quot;Goblet Of Fire&quot;  which chooses  contestants for a tournament involving other schools of witchcraft and  wizardry.  Harry is helped throughout the tournament by a new teacher  &quot;Mad Eye Moody&quot;  someone who you begin to trust throughout the  story.  Harry makes his way through the tournament tasks and unexpectactly  finds himself face to face with Lord Voldemort, resulting In the death of  not a prominant, but significant character.  By the end things have got so  messy you can only cringe at the things which are no doubt to come. This Is  by far the most compelling instalment In the series.  I've read critics  complain Rowling Is writing directly at a more adult audience, this Is  definetely not the case; For a start, Rowling already holds a huge adult  audience with these books, parents enjoy them just as much as their  children, also (like Harry himself) Rowling's prime audience of 8 to 12  year olds are growing up as well, I think It's fitting that children can  grow up with these stories as they themselves become more mature.  Although  for especially young children of anyone under seven, parents should  defineteley read along, the last hundred or so pages can be frightning and  sometimes shocking.  And as Dumbledore explains the stories events to Harry  (and readers) Rowling has you flipping back hundreds of pages to realise  just how intricately intwined the plot really Is.  Simply an amazing read  from cover to cover, &quot;The Goblet Of Fire&quot; Is to the previous  Instalments what &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was to &quot;Star  Wars&quot;, It gives the series deeper meaning and makes an already  enjoying tale Into something better than you thought It could be.

Revenge of the Muggles
I have decided to write my review on the most mystifying fact about Harry Potter- The Ban.     The leading complaint is that Harry Potter 'promotes witchcraft' But, why does that matter? It isn't like we can get ideas from  the book and hex our friends, is it? If this was true, I would have long  since bought out most of Diagon Alley.    Another prospect is that if your  children honestly believe this world exists, then you have more problems  that just witchcraft to worry about!      Another point to ponder, as they  say, is the man behind most of the banning HAS NEVER EVEN READ THE BOOK! He  claims it is 'clearly unappropriate for all Christians and I don't need to  read it to know that'  I am a Christian and a Harry Potter fan, and I don't  see any conflict whatsoever in the two. [...] Thank you for reading my  review. I hope you liked the book, too.

Exciting, Entertaining -- But Also Different
I found &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; to be just as exciting and entertaining as the previous books, if not more so. Rowlings is a great storyteller, and all her familiar trademarks are here: the colorful and eccentric characters, the humor, the playful use of words, the  masterful cultivation of suspense. The book is over seven hundred pages  long, but at the end you'll be wishing it were longer. There isn't a slow  spot in it.<p>The story is, however, different in some ways from the  previous ones. It's a lot darker and scarier, for one thing. Voldemort and  his supporters play a prominent role in it, and their malice forms a  palpable undercurrent in the plot from chapter one on. By the end of the  story, you get to see just HOW evil Voldemort and his minions actually are.  And let me tell you, they're pretty evil. <p>The other big  difference is that Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends are starting to  grow up. The boys and girls have begun to notice each other now, and all  the familiar problems of adolescence--jealousy, insecurity, fear of  rejection, desire to fit in--or stand out--are starting to descend on them.  I enjoy seeing the characters evolve in this way, but those who would  rather they stay eternal 11-year-olds may be disappointed.<p>The story is  not as self-contained as those in the previous books. Many plot lines are  left open at the end, presumably to be resolved in books #5, 6, and 7. If  you think you had a hard time waiting for &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; to  come out, wait till you finish it and are left thinking about the next  one!<p>All in all, I highly recommend this book. If you're already a Harry  Potter fan you won't be disappointed, and if you're not, reading it might  very well make you one.

THE BEST FROM THE SERIES SO FAR
Harry's getting older, that's for sure. The first page of this book absolutely will give you a shock. It's DIFFERENT. Our wizard had to deal not only with a mean teacher, pile of homeworks, and quidditch training. But here in this book, he had to deal with a confusion of getting a girl for the Ball, face a gigantic dragon, love triangle, lack of friends and respect, and the Lord Voldemort himself. I assure you, you can't possibly put this one down and had to read it again and again even if you don't want to. Another superb work of Ms.Rowling...10 thumbs up!.

Another great book!
Hello<p>I don't really care for &quot;fantasy&quot; type books<p> Yet I find myself unable to put down this book<p>I've read the  rest of the books, and each one mounts more tension. I was very doubtful at  the series when my little sister was trying to get me to read it  (&quot;it's about WIZARDS! stop bugging me&quot;) but once I started the  first book, I was hooked.   The reason I like it is because the way it is  written and the story, you feel like you are actually THERE, at Hogwarts,  as Harry Potter. Books have never done that for me.  <p>I put it down and  I'm just like:     whoa,            I'm at home.....<p>This latest book is  a little darker than previous ones, it's a lot longer too, but all the  better.. more time to spend as Harry!  The ending is full of suspence and  is spectacular.  I was almost shaking with excitement as I read.  The  author leaves it hanging a little at the very end:  I can't wait for the  next one to come out!  This book was definatly worth my money (the little  of it I have.)  The hours of enjoyment make it worth every penny.

As enjoyable a read as ever
It surprises me that these books have caused such a ridiculous ruckus, yet the Phil Pullman &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy hasn't seemed to raise an eybrow outside of listservs (where they are enthusiastically discussed.) NOTE: This is in no way encouraging any criticism of Pullman. His books are simply wonderful. <p>I feel badly that Rowling has taken such heat for a series that continues to astound.   With each book, the world she has created comes together in a much more cohesive fashion.  Book 4 is notable not only for its innovations and adventure (it's a bold move on Rowling's part to have an entire school year with no Quidditch matches, at the same time, it makes sense and keeps us from getting tired of repetition.) Another high point is that Rowling develops her stories, and adds secondary characters from the other books to help the story move forward.  Did you think you'd seen the end of the house elves,Sirius Black, Moaning Myrtle or the Dementors? Guess again.  Rowling uses them in this book in interesting ways.  By doing this, Rowling also makes each book an essential part of the whole, and every sign is pointing us forward to book 5.<p>Another strong point of the book is the return of all of our favorite characters, and the newest developments.  Is there some kind of romantic tension between Ron and Hermione? Perish the thought, but Rowling skillfully doles out soap opera, humor, and horror and balances it very carefully.  Rowling also doesn;t spare her magic characters either.  For the past three books, we kind of were split along the &quot;magic good, muggles bad&quot; lines... this is fine,except every reader of the book (including Rowling)is a Muggle. At times, it almost became embarrassing to see non-magical characters seen as lumpish, dumb and slovenly.  In this book, we see that all the magical beings are not so perfect and pure either, most notably in a rather disturbing scene at the World Quidditch Cup matches where Muggles are hapless victims of a cruel prank. This is good as it begins to erase the rather polarized lines that Rowling had developed, and allows us to question our own black and white beliefs (i.e., not every oppressed group reacts to oppression in a noble fashion.)  Rowling also gives us the sense of political awakening in Hermione, as she sees the injustice in the situation of the house elves.  I am interested to see this situation explored more in other novels. <p>This book is, so far, the darkest of the lot.  But Harry bravely faces these challenges (including an exciting and darkly terrifying climax.) But don't let that dissuade you from reading this 4th book.  The only real complaint is that Rowling is hinting that she may wait 2 years to release the next book.  I hardly find this fair, as the first three books were released all in the span of one year.  2 years is too long of a wait, and I think a bit unfair to her loyal readers.  But, we'll see. In the meantime, I may just begin to read the series over again to kill time until the next book.  I suspect I am not the first person to do that either.

My New Favorite book
The 4th Harry Potter book is GREAT! Why? Because J.K.Rowling used a lot of imagination (making up all the spells and coming up with the Triwizard Tournament...).     Compared with the first 3, it's much longer, but it has  more suspense and surprises. The book is also easier to read than other  books I have read: The Hobbit, Lord of the Ring - for example. (although  their stories are also exciting). It's SOOOO good, that I couldn't put it  down- so I finished it in 2 days, with time for shopping and swimming (I  had to go with my parents...).     The part when Harry goes to a real  Quidditch match gets really exiting (With the Dark Mark and Death  eaters-the servants of Lord Voldemort). Most of the new characters come  from the other wizarding schools(like Durmstang).     When Dumbledore  anounces that Hogwarts will be participating in the Triwizard Tournament,  the whole school was exited. Who gets to represent Hogwarts? (Only anyone  over 17). But you can guess who, I bet.     The other night 2 ladies were  arguing on TV over wether Harry Potter was a good book or not. One of them  said it was bad because of witchcraft, witches and spells. The other one  said that Harry Potter was a good book for kids to read because it's only  fantasy. I agree with her and, like science fiction,  I can tell it's not  REAL. Harry is not on the bad side- he's against it and he is fighting it.        Harry Potter books are fun to read, and they're really interesting  too!

A Phenomenal Book
J.K. Rowling has done it again! Her first three installments in the Harry Potter series were outstanding, she has outdone herself once more with the Goblet of Fire . I am only 13, but I know a remarkable book when I see one.  The way Miss Rowling began the book was very intriguing. Harry Potter and  his friends are introduced to situations that children around the world  face everyday, with magic and fantasy added. Quite frankly you know you are  reading an excellent book when you can't put it down until 2 a.m., which is  common for Harry Potter enthusiasts such as myself. You get to both love  and despise the characters in the book. You cannot expect things to happen  in the Harry Potter series because of how shifting the topics are. At the  end of each chapter you want to read on. Unexpected happenings pop-up all  over the book. In my opinion the Harry Potter books have terrific  characters, plots, and they are filled with the imagination of a child,  which makes the Harry Potter series so unique.

Absolutely amazing
This is the very best book in the series so far!  I picked up the very first copy off the shelf last nite(actually this morning, it was 12:01), and as soon as i got in the car i started reading it...The book was so good i didnt stop reading till 9 o'clock this morning--when i finished it..  The  book is full of mystery and intrigue.  And as J.K. Rowling promised us,  there is a lot of dark stuff happening, rise of great evil.  But you cant  have a completely scary book ... We also find out many  secrets of different characters, secrets of people we hated, or people we  felt sorry for.  I wish i could say more, but even the smallest hint would  ruin it. ... Rowling has put  together one of the best books ever.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat  through it all. Anyways, i recommend this book for most anyone, a bit long and  &quot;dark&quot; for a lot younger kids, but even they will love nearly all  of it.  Buy it, i can guarantee you will LOVE it.

Why You Should Try Harry if You Dislike the Fantasy Genre
Holy dementors!...what can I add to about 3,000 reviews?  Well, let me try a different approach, pitching this review to those of you avoiding  &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; (as well as the series) because you don't care  much for the fantasy genre, let alone the kind that works so many kids into  a frenzy.<p> I never cared much for fantasy myself. It was always difficult  to work up interest in works that created umpteen different little  characters, with varying powers and talents, scattered across lands that  are only clearly imagined in the author's head.  Maps,appendices,  glossaries -- who needs all that!     But then comes this wonderful,  insanely imaginative writer named J.K. Rowling.  Oh J.K., what have you  done to me?  Turned me into a reader of books that kids are wild about!   But more importantly... how?  Well, here's what I suspect:<p> Rowling,  unlike many other fantasy authors, has been clever enough to capture a  sense of BALANCE between her fantasy world and the real world that we all  share.  Hogwart's, for all it's magical passageways, ghosts, and other  quirks, IS in many ways similar to the real schools and colleges that we  have attended.  The magic and witchcraft professors share many odd and  charming traits that you DO see in their real-life counterparts (and as an  academic, I can assure you, there really ARE Lockharts, Dumbledores,  Trelawneys, and Snapes out there!).  Every kid has in one way or another  seen home as a sort of &quot;prison&quot; at times, and longed for some  degree of power over situations.  The magic of Harry Potter is the magic of  our own human aspirations.  And it is put forth in a world that, while  fantastical, has enough similarity to our own that we can feel very much  more a part of it.  I know, I know, the Potter books have become a huge  mass-market success... but Rowling is a major literary talent even in spite  of all that hoopla.  Moreover, she was clever enough to anticipate the  paranoia of some readers over books about wizards and witches, and gently  but deservedly parodies them in the form of certain &quot;muggles.&quot;   So if you think fantasy is not for you, please give Harry Potter a try...  these books really DO live up to all the hype they've been receiving.  And  thanks J.K., for showing a world of readers that magic does exist in every  nook and cranny of our lives!

One Happy Muggle......
What can one say?  This is not for muggles who are weak at heart!  A fantastic rollercoaster ride of suspense, treachery and of course magic!  J.K Rowling is on her way to being one of the best fantasy writers of the  21st century.<p>Forget that nonsense that Harry Potter books are &quot;Just  for Kids&quot;.  I am 32 years old, and although a kid at heart, I find I  can not put these books down.  Yes, it's long - but I still flew through  it, it's hold on the reader is that strong!  <p>All I can say is, Ms.  Rowling - keep 'em coming!  You say you can't write a book in 6 months -  well, I hope you won't keep us waiting too long for book 5!  I must find  out what is happening! Danger and intrigue lie ahead for young Potter, so I  say - &quot;Accio Book 5! &quot;

Spellbinding!  Jim Dale Reads Potter Perfectly!
A few facts:  I'm 40 years old.  Director of Direct Marketing for a major business-to-business advertising agency.  Hold a Master's degree in Communications.  Am a muggle.  And, I'm not ashamed to admit, was totally  captivated (who says they're just for kids?) by the audio CD edition of  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth installment in the  world-famous series by J.K. Rowling.  A few opinions:  I have all three of  the previous books on CD and loved every minute of them.  In fact, there  were times when I didn't want to stop driving and get out of my car (even  when I arrived at my destination!) because I was so engrossed in the  stories.  But if I thought British performer Jim Dale's reading was amazing  before, I was doubly impressed with him this time around.  As you know,  Goblet of Fire is over twice the size of the other books in the series -- a  total of 17 unabridged CDs, some 20 hours!  Plus, there are dozens of new  characters, some of whom are from foreign lands, and some extremely  gripping action scenes.  Yet, Dale seamlessly switched from character to  character, deftly handling all the accents, all the action...all the while  capturing every emotional nuance of Rowling's words.  A less gifted reader  wouldn't have been able to pull it off and surely would have left the  listener scratching his head wondering who's saying and doing what to whom.   Dale must be part wizard himself!  For some reason, I found the first few  chapters (maybe even the first few CDs) slow going.  But the story picked  up steam and by the last 4-5 CDs I literally found myself sitting in  parking lots, with the car's CD player on, not wanting to walk away from  what was happening.  I was riveted.  If you've never heard Jim Dale read a  Harry Potter book before, you don't know what you're missing.  Nothing  brings the books to life like hearing the characters speaking.  And nothing  makes the drive to and from work more enjoyable.  My favorite  characterizations are Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy, Hagrid, McGonnagal and, of  course, Harry -- but Dale is very adept at making ALL of Rowling's  characters leap off the pages.  The combination of Rowling's imaginative  words and Dale's superb reading make for a spellbinding experience.  (By  the way, if you're thinking of trying the audio version of the Harry Potter  books, you might want to start with something other than the massive Goblet  of Fire.  Goblet is a deep, sometimes dark, often complex and inarguably  lengthy book that will require a more substantial commitment of time and  attention than the other books in the series.  That's not a bad thing,  however.  Just be forewarned.)

I am surprised...
I am very shocked at how some people think of this book. I mean, I always knew there were weirdos out there who think Harry Potter is dangerous...people who think that it puts bad ideas into kids' minds. There is nothing terrible about these books. It's fantasy, and some people don't have any imagination to believe in it. Just because the book says something doesn't mean that it's real. I read about some fool kid who jumped off his house's roof on a broom because the book said brooms flew. HONESTLY! It's fantasy, people, it's not real! I also read about some girl who was so scared of the books that she had nightmares for a month. Obviously she wasn't old enough not to be scared, so why were they read to her, or why did she read them? They are thrilling and chilling, but not scary! Someone else said that the only people who read Harry Potter are people who are uneducated, don't pay attention in class, or slackers who need something to read for a summer reading list at the last second. NOT TRUE! I'm a sixth grader, a straight-A student, and I don't procrastinate. All of my friends are the same, and we adore Harry Potter and its capturing story. J.K. Rowling has really outdone herself, and it shows! We all expect something as perfect for the fifth book, and we're sure it will deliver!

Unconventional Harry Potter! The Best Yet!
`The Goblet of Fire' is book 4 in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling.  It is also the largest book to date in this series.  To fully appreciate this one, you simply must read the preceding three.  Book 4 takes a completely different turn from the first three, with an entirely unconventional year at Hogwarts. 	In this book Harry Potter get exposed in a big way to the international world of wizardry by first attending the `Quidditch World Cup' and later becoming a part of a very exciting and secret competition between two other wizarding schools like Hogwarts.   	The characters from preceding books are in full swing in this one, and as usual J.K. Rowling introduces even more colorful and exciting characters in this edition.  Additionally there is the alarming return of the frightening 'He who must not be named'. 	There is nothing quite like the imagination of this author, it is simply wonderful and brilliant.  She really has an incredible gift for capturing the reader in the most unusual and exciting adventures. 	This book has kind of a dark and scary ending, unlike the preceding three.  All the same, however,  it sets up the reader with screaming curiosity for the forth-coming book 5. 	You will simply enjoy this one as the whole story broadens out to become a huge global adventure, and Harry Potter is the ultimate hero.  This series has a unique way of spanning the generations of readers, and anyone looking for something fun and entertaining to read should definitely dig into this series.  You will find yourself captured like none other with this imaginative and refreshing creation.	 	Further the illustrations by Mary Grandpre are just right throughout the book to keep you turning page after page.   	The biggest problem with this book is that it leaves you ravenously wanting to read book 5, and it has not been released yet!  A remarkable story, and it has me totally captured!  You will simply love it!

Fantastic Beyond Words
Entering the world of Harry Potter is better than living all the fantasies you had growing up - because it's all made real through every word.

The next, you find yourself  experiencing the joys and pains of becoming a teenager.  The story is  extraordinarily well developed.  It never stops and always makes you want  to keep going.  This is a perfect series of books that truly gets better  each time you pick them up.  The character names and story lines will  become embedded in your mind.  Book #5 cannot come soon enough.

WOW!  Amazing!
As a 20 year old fan of Potter, I have to say that Rowling has outdone herself.  I laughed at the beginning, cried at the end, was mesmerized throughout!   Honestly, the book may be a little dark for younger Potter  fans, especially those with really active and really good imaginations.   The characters have also started using the &quot;d&quot; word.  But the  story is truly amazing and enchanting.  I'm convinced that Rowling is a  witch herself that casts a spell on every copy, making the reader  ABSOLUTELY UNABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!   :-)  I've never read 200 pages of a  book at one sitting before. I recommend this book to any Potter reader, but  feel that the first 3 books should be read beforehand, and might be read by  parents to their younger Potter readers.

10 stars!
This is a superb book, full of suspense, mischief, fun, and adventure!  Nobody can say this book wasn't good-it's far from it!  I recommend this book to anybody.  It's not just about magic, it's about kids having fun.

Harry Potter will stand the test of time
Long after the seventh and final book is published, when the hype has all died down, Harry Potter will be remembered as one of the greatest fantasy stories ever written.  The saga reaches epic proportions in book 4 where at  the end, there is a foreboding feeling of a mighty upcoming battle in the  wizarding world.  Wizards must decide where their loyalties lay and to what  extent they will be willing to fight.  With the fourth book, Harry Potter  has left the realm of just another children's book and become a great  fantasy story.  Don't listen to the hype. Read them and make up your own  mind. You won't be disappointed.

Yes.
Yes, it's over 700 pages...but I still finished it in onenight. You won't find yourself counting pages left, I promise.<p>Yes,it's up to par.  Rowling continues with some threads she'd started in earlier books... and starts some interesting new ones...<p>Goblet of Fire is a little darker than the earlier books, ...but I still found myself laughing out loud in several spots. If there's anyone left who hasn't read the earlier books, it's best to start at the beginning and work your way through, but Goblet of Fire does have plenty of reminders and explanations of what happened in the earlier books, in case you've forgotten anything. <p>Also, a comment to parents who might be thinking of not letting their children read Goblet of Fire: please consider these points. Do you want to deprive your children of the chance to read a book of both literary and moral value that is still fun to read? Do you really want to keep them away from a book that has turned more non-readers into enthusiastic readers than anything in recent memory?  Do you want to keep them from a story that teaches loyalty, perseverance, courage, and the value of learning and of independent thought?...  END

How can I wait for the next one!
Well, I must start this review by saying that I am not 9 or even 12.  I am a twenty-seven year old who recently returned to grad school.<p>I started Year 4 on Saturday morning.  I read, almost non-stop, all day long  literally glued to the book (resenting any of the banal trivialities of  life--i.e. food, commitments, etc. that took me away from it) until at 9:30  p.m. Saturday night I reached the riveting last page.<p>In my opinion, this  is the best book of the series (I recently re-read books 1-3 to regain a  sense of continuity). Rowling continues to grow and develop the  characters--Hermione becomes an object of desire for both new and old  characters; Harry and Ron struggle with the awkwardness of growing boys to  develop new relationships with girls and to deal with the expression of  their feelings for the girls around them.  Fred and George begin to prepare  for life after Hogwarts in a way which provides a lot of fun and amusement.  Draco Malfoy gets a come-uppance in one of the funniest ways impossible (I  laughed out loud delightedly).<p>In this book, Harry Potter struggles with  his fame--he almost loses friendships because of it, and he has to deal  with the vicious press.  He encounters an unscrupulous reporter who  attempts to destroy both his reputation and the reputations of others close  to him.<p>Of course, Voldemort is again back trying to regain power.  The  whole book has a sinister undertone because of the question about who in  Hogwarts in helping him.  The clues are sparse so the reader is left with a  sense of dread.  <p>This book does contain death, but the impact of the  death is mitigated by Harry's nobleness in dealing with it.<p>The best part  of this book is that it leaves me hungering for another. Late developments  in the book with Cornelius Fudge and Severus Snape leave plenty of chaos to  be mopped in the next book.  In fact, at the end of book four, the future  looks very bleak for good wizards and witches.<p>Like the others, the rich  description and humor of the book as well as the real-life parallels make  the place and time come alive. Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Weasleys, Sirius  Black, and all our other favorites are back, better than ever.

She's done it again -- but who's surprised?  :)
I think Harry Potter may well prove to be the fad diet of theNaughties: the moment I purchased &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet ofFire&quot; ... , petty habits like eating and sleeping  were put on the back burner until the last page had been turned. <p>It's  well known by now that Rowling's prose draws you in (enchants you, if you  will), and the fourth installment in the series is no exception. Never have  I had the pleasure to read a series that has gotten *consistently better*  with each sequel.. not until Harry Potter, that is. <p>After staying up far  too late on the seventh (or would that be far too early on the eighth--?),  I stumbled out of bed and brought the newest book with me to the gym,  drawing some interesting looks from the folks around me as I kept my eyes  riveted to the pages instead of the treadmill readout. My only regret is  that I couldn't continue to read it when I did my laps in the pool! =)  <p>Rest assured, those who doubted, that Rowling has, once again, surpassed  herself. Not since Roald Dahl have I enjoyed so-called &quot;children's  books&quot; so immensely; Rowling's dark sense of humor and knack for the  fantastic remind me of such classics as &quot;The Witches&quot; and  &quot;Matilda,&quot; favorites of mine since I was a young'n. But curse the  woman for writing so well -- it takes me one day to read the books, and a  year for the next to come out! <p>Ah well. That's what rereading is for, I  suppose.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
This episode of Harry Potter was well worth the wait....  Why does every press release think of this as children's literature? I am 55 years old and just as thrilled with  these books as everyone else and so are all MY friends. This last one  releases the dark forces to carry the next three. It's the year's best  read.

As a well-read 30 yr old professional, I cannot believe how captivated I am with these books!   I equate it to rereading Alice in Wonderland or The  Lion,The Witch,and the Wardrobe-written for children but always good for  the young at heart and those with a great imagination.  Just one  question-how long until book 5?   I can't wait!   Buy the series- you won't  regret it!

A Hard Act Followed
I admit it. I am an adult, and yet I spent the better part of the last two days stealing time to read [and, yes, finish (it isn't short)]this book. Harry Potter is not the world's greatest wizard- J.K. Rowling is. Only magic can explain her ability to deliver a book as satisfying as  &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,&quot; in the face the enormous  pressure, hype, and expectations that built up to it. No mere mortal could  have pulled it off.   Though HPatGoF starts somewhat slowly with a  prologue, it quickly regains momentum with a return visit with the Weasleys  followed by the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. Rowling's  trademark imaginative touches are everywhere: team color badges that scream  the players' names, flags that play their national anthems when waved, and  action figures that are really active.  After that we're back to the fourth  year at Hogwarts where Harry is chosen as its representative in the  Triwizard Tournament against rival schools Durmstrang and Beaux-batons.  Of  course, the threat of Voldemort shrouds the proceedings leading up to a  thrilling wand duel that will not disappoint even the most avid Robin Hood,  Star Wars, or Three Musketeers fans.    &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is a worthy successor to  the three books that came before it.  It entertains and instructs, and in a  world where real-life heroes are often less than heroic it provides role  models for kids of all ages. I eagerly await book five.

A great reading adventure for all ages
As an adult who grew up on JRR Tolkein and other Sci-Fi and fantasy greats, I am thrilled that the Harry Potter series has become so popular. My 11 year son waits just as eagerly for the next release as I do, and even though the books have gotten amazingly lengthy, we both rip through them as quickly as we can. <p>When Goblet of Fire came out, he read through the entire book in 2 days, handed it over to me, and I stayed up until 5am so I could finish it as well. Since then we have lent it out to numerous friends and relatives who were equally in love with it.<p>It has all the classic elements - good against evil, bullies, unfair situations, misunderstandings, the magic that can help you win even when all seems lost. If nothing else, it is encouraging millions of youngsters to read in an age that tv and computers are replacing books. I applaud J.K. Rowling and wish her all the success in the world.

Clue has an upgrade
I bought this board game thinking that the only allure it would have for my 8 year old son was the fact that it was Harry Potter based. I was happy to be wrong and surprised . I love that there is an added level to the old style clue with the dark mark deck and help cards. The most challenging part for my three boys is not losing all of your house points before you can rescue the lost student. If your child is a Harry Potter fan or not i think this toy is a very smart purchase and very worth the price paid for it. I would only say that you should be aware this is definately not for anyone younger than 7 reading is a big must.(my 4 year old was broken hearted he couldn't play too, so he became the dice thrower!)

Family fun and educational
<br />My 8 yr old son got this game for Christmas and we love it as a family.  There are some creative changes from the original Clue game but still the same overall strategies.  We definitely recommend this game!   The only flaw is the house points that you get, they are easy to lose and when you run out you can ultimately lose the game.  We decided to change that rule to losing a turn and not the game.  Otherwise, a lot of fun!!

Great version of Clue
I bought this for my wife who is a Harry Potter fanatic. I like the books and movies, but am not much into remakes of clue. But once I played this, I was hooked. I love the randomness, the fairness, and the fact of the possibility that no one can win. It is worthwhile for anyone, and a great buy.

Harry Potter Clue!
We'ver really enjoyed this game.  It's a bit different from the original clue game because you can lose house points and that can take you out of the game just when you think you've got the mystery solved, but that turns out to be a nice twist.<br /><br />Players don't really have to know about the world of Harry Potter to play the game and win, but fans of the septology will enjoy it.<br /><br />Clue is also a great game of skill.  Although there is certainly an element of luck in the game, it's mental skill and the ability to make inferences and deductions that helps someone win.  <br /><br />I definitely recommend the game.

Harry Potter Nerds
Love this game!  Not the biggest fan of the house points though.  We've had a few games where people run out of house points by the third turn so we just don't play with them anymore.  The secret passageways changing add a great twist to this classic game.

We love Harry Potter and we love board games.  Clue is taken to a new level with additional game play all with Harry Potter characters, spells, and story line.  Highly recommend for all Harry Potter or Clue fans!

fun version of clue even if you're not a Harry Potter fan
I bought this for my family because we're love and clue and my preteen daughters also love Harry Potter. I was expecting just regular Clue with a Harry Potter on the cards.  But no.. its got game new elements to it.  Its more of a challenge and adds a new level to Clue.  Its fun for the adult family members who are not familiar with HP even.  Its great.  We love it.  We prefer it to the original Clue game.

Our family is really enjoying this game.  It ties right into our 7 1/2 year-old's love of all things Harry Potter and the rotating wheels and dark mark cards add a whole new level of challenge to the game of Clue that I enjoyed as a kid.

Harry Potter & Clue, together=excellent
Love Harry Potter. Looooovvvvveeeeee Clue. Intreguing twists like wheels you spin to open & shut doors & change secret passages. Help cards featuring allies, spells, & items so you can defend yourself against the Dark Mark cards. House Points, lose 'em all & you're out of the game. Rather exciting!

Great for ALL ages!!
So, I'm a college student. I bought this game mostly because I love board games, and secondly because I love Harry Potter. Needless to say, I convinced several of my college age friends to play and we couldn't get enough!! Several of my friends aren't even Harry Potter fans, but they love the game anyway. The changing corridors as well as the ally and magic cards add a new level of difficulty and interest. These new additions keep the game interesting for hours and hours!! They make it hard to get bored!!! :) Definitely work every penny!!

Hours of Enjoyment
I have to admit I am a huge HP fan therefore the reasoning behind the purchase of the game. <br />The first time the game was played I was actually only a spectator and so when I did get to play I was a bit confused the first time but I think we all were just getting used to the differences in this game compared to the original. <br />I have several friends whom I play board games with regularly and they not being HP fans were very skeptical about playing. I finally talked them into it and now it is one of our must play games each time we get together. We do tend to "cheat" a bit with the house points sometimes but it's all in the fun of the game. <br />Once you play a time or two you'll be hooked!

Family Favorite
This game has become a family favorite. My husband does not even like Harry Potter. When my son got this game for Christmas he played along with the family. Now he says it is his favorite game. I have always liked the original Clue game as a kid but I like the additional twists and turns in the Harry Potter Clue even better. They just add more dimension to a great game.

Great Family Fun
This is a great way to play Clue. There are enhancements to the regular game, specialized to the "magical" world, such as the secret passageways that open and close or change. Plus, you can collect and lose house points, and if you lose them all before the game is solved, you're out of it. One of my kids is a huge Harry Potter fan, as am I, but the whole family enjoyed playing this game together. And what I like most about it is that you aren't solving a murder, rather a mystery of a missing student. Much more child friendly that way.<br /><br />

Clue:The Harry Potter Way
We opened this early Christmas week. College kids home and game night took place in front of fire. We loved it because even though you might know who caused a disappearance of a main character, where it happened, and how it was done you may never get the chance because of the dark mark! It causes you to lose house points. So you might be out of the game when your house points are gone! The room entry doors are sealed at different times. Same rules as the other Clue game, but added tweeks(Dark Mark and spells)make this game really fun.

For the fan not the fanatic
While I value all posted opinions of this product I strongly disagree with the notion that this product is dumb.  For anyone who has waited many long years and not purchased any of the movies until now, or anyone who was hooked later in the series, this set is a real value.  All the released movies are bundled neatly together and they don't consume much space in my movie library because of the slim packaging.<br /><br />This set is certainly not for the collector as there is no bonus material whatsoever.  This is fine for us as we generally never watch the second disc anyway.  If you have been waiting to buy or are new to the series and you don't mind the lack of bonus material this set really makes it easy to start your collection.  <br /><br />If this does not describe what you are looking for then I suggest you do as the other reviewers have suggested and look elsewhere or wait till the complete set releases in several years.  For what this product is however (all current movies/no frills), this is a great set.<br /><br />

Great Buy
The set contains 7 blu-ray discs in 6 cases. The seventh disc, entitled "Disc 2 Special Features" is inside the "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" case. The movies themselves are in 1080p HD 16x9. Audio is Dolby TrueHD: 5.1.   The special features disk appears to be full screen, still HD (near as I can tell).<br /><br />Special Features Disc Include:<br />"Close-Up with the Cast of Harry Potter" -- A series of short videos that cover topics ranging from editing, owl training, special effects, makeup, costume design, artwork and more behind the scene material.<br />"One-Minute Drills" -- Challenges cast member to describe their character roles in the first 6 films in 60 seconds<br />"First Footage from harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows" -- Brief introduction from producer and director with behind the scene footage.  As well as a theatrical style preview. <br />" J. K. Rowling: A Year in the Life" -- Documentary style look at J.K. Rowling's work on the Harry Potter series.<br />"What's on your mind?" -- An eclectic Q&A session between Tom Felton (Draco) and the cast of Harry Potter.<br />"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter-Sneak Peek" -- Universal Orland Resort in Florida preview of new Harry Potter themed area.<br />"Additional Footage":  8 additional movie scenes <br /><br />The box set itself, measures approximately (H x W x D) 6.875" x 1.5" x 5.3125".  Each disc case measures approximately (H x W x D) 6.75" x 0.25" x 5.3125".  These are ultra thin cases, not the standard blu-ray cases.<br /><br />Box set price (as of the date of this review) was less then I could purchase the blu-rays for individually (either online or at mortar-and -brick retailer.)

Worth every penny
What can you say about a set of great movies which are then improved even more by putting them on Blu-ray and packaging all six together?  If you purchase the six individual Blu-ray movies, they currently run $105.94 as opposed to the $92.99 for this set.  So you not only get top-quality movies, but you save $13.00 in the process.  The picture quality and sound quality are superb.  As I said, there isn't much more to say about movies that have been reviewed hundreds of times.  As for an erroneous opinion that you are getting ripped off by this set, all I can say is do the math.  The 5-pack Blu-ray version sells here for $80.99, not $54.99 (that was the DVD 5-pack which is now down to $49.99), so the difference between the 5-pack and the 6-pack is only is only $12.00.  The Half Blood Prince sells individually for $19.49, so, you save $7.49 off the price of the sixth movie by buying this set.

Great DVD package
The DVD's are in a thinner plastic case and all 6 are in a box sleeve. Really compact. Wouldn't it be great if all DVD's were like that, allowing for more in a smaller storage area. This is a great addition to my collection and will be fun to watch again and again. This package is definitely a best buy.

Love It!!
I lost all my movies a while back and i'm so glad Warner decided to release them like this.. No worrying about having to like buy them all seperate and paying like 60. bucks. I can just buy this boxset and I'm set until the final 2 movies(yes i'm actually aware that it's book 7 split into 2 but still). Anyway they don't take up much room the only thing I would warn about is these are the bare bones discs.. NOT the 2 Disc Special Editions. But still they are great if you want to just simply pay like 40. bucks and have up to the newest movie!

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
Harry Potter has lived a dismal life with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. He sleeps in a closet and has never had a birthday party or Christmas presents. Even worse, he has to endure life with his horrible  spoiled cousin, Dudley. Then on Harry's eleventh birthday, things change  when a letter arrives, (by owl), inviting him to attend the Hogwarts School  of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Suddenly Harry finds himself among friends,  learning about potion-making and magic-wand waving and broomstick riding.  There're chocolate frogs and Every Flavor Beans and a three-headed dog and  Quidditch-a game better than soccer. Also, Hagrid, a lovable gamekeeper who  befriends Harry; Hermione Granger, a witch who's read all the school books  and knows all the rules; and there's Ron Weasly, Harry's best friend who  has quite a legacy of his own to fill. Hogwarts treats him well, even with  the abomidable Malfoy's mean tricks or Professor Snape's obvious hatred of  Harry. The soon Harry finds himself in the middle of a mystery at Hogwarts,  and together with his two new friends, embarks on adventures he never  dreamed possible.<p>The book is engaging with its imagery, humor, plot  twists and real-life child problems. The book doesn't only appeal to  children but adults as well. She's a master on fantasy. She really can,  with no difficulty at all, think herself back to 11 years old. You will  love the whimsical descriptions, humorous quotes and the fun characters.

Three Harry Potter Books in Three Days!
An adult friend (age 49)loaned me three Harry Potter books for the summer. Wednesday evening I began the first book and I finished the third today, Saturday morning. I am writing this review before I order the fourth Potter  book.  Will my friend be surprised to get 4 books back! The author's  imagination is vividly presented in a cast of almost believable characters  attending a school we all wish we could attend. Classes like &quot;Defense  Against Dark Arts&quot;, &quot;Divination&quot;,  &quot;Transfiguration&quot;, &quot;Arithmancy&quot; and &quot;Care of  Magical Creatures&quot; are written as if the author actually attended them  and certainly enjoyed every minute of class.  More than can be said for  most of the classes I have attended. Each book in the series encompasses  one year of Harry's fascinating life. The Potter books are written in a way  that can charm any age reader.  I am 64.

I want to go to Hogwarts!
Granted, I lack the basic criterion for being an expert on children's book--I'm 26 years old.  For old times' sake, I do try to stay current on what's new in children's book.  Compared to almost everything else I've  read, Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter series stands far ahead of the pack.<p>Ms.  Rowling takes a classic scenario in British children's  literature--adolescent children going to boarding school--and turns it on  its head.  Usually, all of the exciting stuff happens during school  holidays (as in C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; or Enid  Blyton's &quot;Five&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; series).  In Harry Potter's  world, school holidays are spent among the &quot;Muggles&quot;--the  non-magical world--while school is where the magic really happens.<p>And  magic there is! From the wizardly sport of Quidditch to classes in potions  to a three-headed dog named Fluffy, Ms. Rowling throws in enough magic to  keep the interest of children (and adults) who don't usually like reading.   A sparkling plot, realistic (if you can imagine a magical world, then these  people belong in it) characters and a fully-realized world combine to  create a true gem of children's literature.  This one can easily share a  shelf with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Alice in  Wonderland&quot; and even &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<p>Don't miss Harry Potter  and his adventures!

Anniversary Edition nice but not essential.
In today's economy, customers buying books need to know exactly what they're buying. In this case, what your thirty bucks buys is -- apart from the previously published text (the novel itself) and the previously published art (interior art) -- is, essentially, a new cover by longtime Harry Potter cover artist Mary GrandPre, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling (quite the cartoonist!), which comprises the "bonus" material Scholastic has been touting but keeping under wraps.<br /><br />The wraps are off and, while the illustration is nice, Scholastic would be better off issuing either an illustration edition with more art (which, by the way, exists), or taking the momentous occasion of the 10th anniversary to celebrate it in a significant fashion: Rowling, why wasn't there an original interview in which you looked back at the ten years of Harry Potter in the media? Why wasn't there a long essay by a respected literary critic looking at the Harry Potter phenomenon? Why wasn't there MORE text?<br /><br />If this was simply a reprint edition, the omission of new text would be understandable. But when you're celebrating ten years of Harry Potter in print, how, exactly, does a new cover, a previously published (to the best of my knowledge) illustration for the colored endpapers, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling "celebrate" the book's publication?<br /><br />As there is no historical retrospective here, I'd have to say that Scholastic missed the boat: This edition could have been so much more, but it suffers (ironically) from a failure of imagination.<br /><br />I have rated it five stars because the first novel is a literary classic in the children's field. The publisher, however, needs to think about how to ADD VALUE to the existing edition when touting its "anniversary" status, esp. if they intend on reissuing matching volumes in the future. Otherwise, it comes off as being just another edition to get the fans' hard-earned money, instead of offering something new, different, and significantly improved.

A magical read in more ways than one!
What a wonderful book!   I read it after my 11-year old son suggested it as a change from my usual reading fare of history and biography.  It turned out to be much more than just a springtime reading diversion...it became  for me a &quot;magical&quot; reading experience in more ways than one.    I  was quickly captivated by Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermoine, and yes,  even the nasty Dursleys, Snape, and Draco Mafoy.  Hogwarts came to life for  me.  I found myself unable to put the book down because it was so exciting  and much fun to read!  It's easy to understand why my son (and so many kids  just like him) love Harry Potter so much. <p>J.K. Rowling proves herself a  gifted writer of children's books, not only because the plot is good and  the characters come to life, but also because her writing fires the  imagination and teaches positive values.<p>&quot;Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a great book for kids of all ages...from 9 to 99.   It's destined to be a classic of children's literature.

Ages 9-12? Hah!
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is one of those rare children's books that seems to be utterly wasted on children. The plot is engaging, the characters are likeable, and it's a good quick read for those older  than the specified ages. I'm 18, and I finished it in a few hours, then  handed it to my mother, who is 39. After she finished it, she agreed that  we needed to get the rest of the series. In a family that regularly reads  Shakespeare, that's high praise! It's a refreshing and enjoyable way to get  your mind off the overly serious Muggle world and bring back a bit of  wonder and magic. If you're a parent considering getting this book for your  child, please do... But get a copy for yourself as well, and enjoy  revisiting your own childhood.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  (Book 1)
First of all, I am 52 years old. While I have always been a big reader, I generally have not read children's book.  However, having seen the Harry Potter books on the best seller lists for months, I finally purchased  Sorcerer's Stone.  <p>I could not put the book down.  While the plots and  storylines are not complicated, they are completely captivating.  Cover to  cover the book is entertaining. I always thought that a wizard's land  (Hogwarts in this case) would be a perfect idealistic place; when in fact  it is full of good and evil, much like our real world.  This thought  captivates me as I begin Book 2.<p>I found the Sorcerer's Stone enchanting;  much like I felt when I read the Tolkien Trilogy. <p>I highly recommend  this book--you have got to love Harry Potter.

How did Harry Potter become a household word?
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone<br />ISBN: 0590353403<br /><br />How did Harry Potter become a household word?<br /><br />I am intrigued by the phenomena of Harry Potter, and this review is a writer / editor's perspective.  The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews, so I will not address them.  <br /><br />I purchased all four books over two years ago, but they sat on my shelf unread.  Then, I was away from home without a book, and a friend loaned me her copy of The Sorcerer's Stone.  Within two weeks, I read all four books.  Why?<br /><br />J. K. Rowlings captures the imagination with prose that draws her readers in.  Details that are not in the movie, such as Harry's hair that stayed one length no matter how often it was cut, which showed that he was a wizard, but did not know it.  <br /><br />* He was different from his peer group; isolated in a world of Muggles.  Children often feel isolated and mistreated, as do adults, therefore most people can relate to this situation.  <br />* He is an orphan who believes his parents died in a car crash, and he has no pictures of them.  He longs to belong, an emotion that is common in all ages.<br />* His room was a closet under the stairs, he never received gifts or a kind word, and was viewed as something to get through by his guardians.  In reality, anyone treated like this is abused.  Yet Harry kept a positive attitude, and enjoyed the privacy the room gave him.  He made the best of bad circumstances.<br />* His cousin was a pampered slob, but he was created by his parents overindulgent behavior.  He received 36 presents for his birthday, but it was not enough.  Things do not replace guardianship. <br />* Harry, small for his age, was the object of ridicule.  Magic delivered him.  Who does not dream of a magical solution to their problems?  This is a writer's tool known as "deus ex machina" or "God out of a machine." Commonly, in editing, this is the "hand of God" tool.  It is generally used in an unconvincing plot, character, or event, however, Rowlings success is because she foreshadowed the magic as part of Harry's character through the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.<br /><br />Other aspects of the writing itself are:<br />* Rowlings does not talk down to her audience of young adults.  <br />* The same story elements that appeal to a child, appeal to an adult; and the book is unique and readable.<br />* Her characters grow, change, and make decisions based on their own motives.<br />* Life is not simple; people do die.<br />* Good and evil exist, as they do in reality, in many guises.  <br />* She takes time to set up the characters, plot, and scenes.  I wondered why she dedicated so many pages to Privet Drive.  This introduced Harry, and because we know how he is treated, we know why Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry immediately becomes his home.  He was wanted.<br />* It is easy to read.  The text flows naturally, even with strange words and unusual names.<br />* Her creativity and descriptions bring life to the story, and you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />Rowlings did not expect her marvelous story to capture readers from all age groups.  She was surprised to be compared to Frank L. Baum who wrote the Wizard of Oz.  <br /><br />Now I, like million of J. K. Rowlings fans from all over the world, anxiously await the next book.  Thus, Harry Potter, became a household word.<br /><br />Victoria Tarrani

I couldn't put it down!
I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was great. I would read it all over again if I wasn't reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  I think that you will love this book as much as I did.  Even  though most would think that it is for children, it is for everyone. I  beleive that J.K. Rowling is a great writer, and that she sould keep  writing more books about Harry Potter.  You willenjoy this book so much, I  couldn't put it down, so I decided to buy  boxed set.  You will love Harry  and Rowling!

Captivating humorous fantasy
HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a fantasy of the order of such great authors as Roald Dahl (MATILDA), C.S. Lewis (THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE), and Madeleine L'Engle (A WRINKLE IN TIME).  Simply put, this  book is a classic and a masterpiece of children's fantasy.<p>This book  introduces us to Harry Potter, who lives with his nasty relatives the  Dursleys.  His life changes one day when he receives a letter from  Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- he's not normal, he's a  Wizard!  From there we are introduced to myriad kooky and endearing  characters: friends Ron and Hermione, big buddy Hagrid, professors  Dumbledore and McGonagall, enemies Snape, Draco, and Vol...  You-Know-Who.<p>J.K. Rowling has masterfully rendered a captivating  page-turner.  This book includes everything one could wish in a fantasy:  interesting characters, a strong tension between good and evil, plenty of  mystery, dramatic twists-and-turns, and a bit of magic.<p>This book is a  must-read for kids and adults alike.  It's imaginative, clever, and a good  read.

Finally a book for the entire family.
I first bought this book due to the asking of my 8 year old cousin.  I hadnt heard much about the series and was truly interested.  Of course, I read the book, in a day and was truly fascinated with the tale.  Luckily  enough for me, I had bought this first book when the other books were  already out so I didnt have to wait long to read the sequels.  So far I  have loved them all and have bought them as gifts for all my younger  cousins and godchildren.  I see no evilness in these books as some people  say.  They are simply about a boy who is looking for something better in  his life, and he is given it.  I think the agony he goes through living  with his Aunt and Uncle are more troublesome, more devestating to  youngsters than his trials at the wizardly school.  People who demean this  book and the rest of the series, stating it is Satanic or whatnot, are  simply looking for something to complain about.  I teach high school, and I  am making my 9th grade class read the series...it may seem a little young  for their tastes but they are enjoying it, just as I did.  It is simply a  series for the entire family, with no evilness intended.  I will continue  to share the world of Harry Potter with my family, friends and students,  for as long as possible.  Everyone has a fantasy - a dream, and Harry  Potters was fullfilled.  He is living the life he so dreamed of living, and  I see nothing wrong with that.  The fact that he has to battle *demons* is  something we do everyday, only they are portrayed so realistically,  although they do much more damage.  This is...as I said earlier...just a  wonderful family book - series.  I would recommend it to anyone.

A BOOK THAT IS GREAT FOR ALL AGES
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book that I would recommend for almost everyone who is capable of reading a book of its size.  It has characters that readers love, and can believe.  The story about a kid who finds out he is a wizard intriges younger readers, while older(and younger)  readers can also enjoy the story and its jokes, but will want to read back  to find the little clues Joanne Rowling drops about the story's major  secret, and read up on some of the history of names etc.  These things make  the story interesting at mutliple levels.

A fantastic story for all ages. A triumph of the imagination
First off, I may not be exactly the demographic that you would think would read this book, or even give it a glance. After all, I am 20 years old, I listen to hip hop and alternative, and my favorite movie of all time happens to be none other than Scary Movie. So why should I care about a book that features a little boy who runs around with his friends casting charms and flying around on his broomstick? Hardly seems worth wasting my precious time.<p>I have heard the name Harry Potter for a couple of years now, watching the evening news and the top story focusing on the mobs of people in line to buy the new novels whenever they are released. I used to laugh at those stories, while feeling sorry for all the grown adults wasting their time reading children's fairy tales. About one month ago, while I was sitting in a chair at my local movie house, I saw a movie trailer that featured the brought-to-life Harry Potter and his adventures. I thought to myself it looked interesting, and maybe I should give the book a try. Two weeks after that, my sister came to visit me and my parents on her way to Chicago. She showed me her collection of all four Harry Potter novels, and told me that I should give them a try. I then proceeded to tell her about seeing the trailer, and my burgeoning interest in Harry Potter. She wasn't finished with the latest novel, but she left me the first three for me to read. It took me a couple of days to get around to start reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but once I did I was hooked.<p>Raised for the first ten years of his life by ordinary people without any magical abilities, otherwise known as Muggles, Harry Potter lives in a world where technology and science rules. Everyone drives automobiles to get from one location to the next, use telephones to communicate to each other, and where everyone is unaware that living among them is a whole society of beings who use magic in place of technology to improve their quality of life. Harry knows nothing of this hidden world, nor does he know anything about how his forgotten past links him to it. He lives a life of misery, mistreated by his aunt and uncle, and tormented by his sadistic cousin. They despise anything that has to do with magic, and do not want Harry corrupted like his wizard parents were. So when it is discovered that Harry has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his  aunt and uncle are not pleased. What follows for several more chapters is an interesting first look at the world Harry has been denied his whole life, full of wizards, witches and spells, dragons and gold fortunes. His first year at Hogwarts will be rewarding for him in so many ways, yet scary and full of mystery. He makes new friends, but develops enemies. Yet overcoming all that is the human spirit, good against evil, which is what really this book is about.<p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is so much more than a magical fantasy or children's fable, it contains within it's pages the very fabric of imagination and wonder that we adults thought we lost. This novel is a very easy read, yet complex enough to keep adults interested to the last page and beyond. J. K. Rowling does a fantastic job of bridging the gaps between childhood and adulthood, childlike imagination and grown up realities. One is never to keen when first reading this, for we are entering a fantastic new world, unexplored and unknown by us, the same as Harry Potter is.

A Magically Good Read
I am far from being in the 9-12 age range (over 40) and I truly enjoyed this book.  I haven't read such a fun book in a long time.  Can't wait to start on the rest of the series.  Thank you J.K. Rowling.

What in the world was I waiting for?
Most decidedly curmudgeonly! Yes, that's it. One of the few remaining people on the planet who hadn't read any of the Harry Potter novels and, like Vernon Dursley, my initial reaction to all this wizard and magic rubbish was a very mugglish "stuff and nonsense". I admit it. As I read the first few pages, my initial thoughts were that this was all quite silly. Where had this Harry Potter phenomenon come from and what did everybody see in it?<br /><br />But then, very quickly actually, JK Rowling, undoubtedly a graduate of Hogwarts herself, began to weave a most hypnotic magical spell and I was hooked. Transported to that child-like garden of delights at Hogwarts - a land of fantasy, witches, warlocks, trolls, spells, potions, charms and, for the readers, total enjoyment and smiles - I fell in love with Harry, Hermione, all of their Gryffindor classmates, and with Dumbledore's paternal wisdom and I cheered wildly as Harry, the team seeker, dove and swooped in quest of the Snitch during their quidditch matches.<br /><br />There is a benefit, of course, to having waited so long to read my first Harry Potter novel, you know. I've got six to go and now I can pick them up, one after another, just as quickly as I want to with no waiting for years at a time for the next book to be published. Eat your hearts out everyone! I claim membership in the legion of Rowling's happy fans.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss

Hogwarts, Year 1
After the constant media bombardment - Harry Potter here, Harry Potter there, I couldn't stand it any longer, decided to find out what this is all about and ordered all four books. This was a risk, if I didn't like the first book, I would have bought three books in vain and wasted a lot of money (I ordered the hardcover editions). But the risk paid off, I loved this book. After the first two chapters, which were interesting but not particulary outstanding, I had my first encounter with Mrs. Rowling's brillant and never-ending imagination. I'm talking about the &quot;letters which have a very, very precise address&quot; (readers of this book will know what I mean, I don't want to spoil it for the others), a simply wonderful idea, and from there, I was completely hooked. As many readers here only pointed out that they liked the book but not why, I'm trying to get a little bit more into detail. First, I'm an adult reader (yes, one of those who are not supposed to read childrens' books - give me a break) and  was astonished that a surprisingly high number of adult readers posting reviews here are 28 years old. As I was astonished, you can easily guess my age.. Back to the book. What makes it such a great read? Well, the plot is cleverly constructed, extremely fast-paced and features a surprising amout of clever twists and turns. You're one of those who always knows what will happen next? Try this one, you will be surprised! The reader encounters a huge array of wonderful and loveable characters (too many to mention here), so wonderful in fact that you even start to like some of the &quot;villains&quot; (it would be a shame to loose, f. ex. Professor Snape) and is deeply immersed in a universe (well, a school) that is so detailed and so well conceived that it is simply impossible not to love it. The prose and style are ok and always appropriate (making it far better than those of other people who also sell millions of copies; no, no names here, I don't want to be dragged into a court). So, adult reader, what are you waiting for? You get everything you expect from a great book - and more, including a slam-bang, very imaginative and satisfying grand finale. Yes, sure, Mrs. Rowling did not re-invent the wheel, but she makes all the elements that she borrowed from countless other fables look fresh - and that is no small accomplishment, making her clearly stand out. This is not a success-story conceived by some marketing people or based on pure luck and I dare to say, even though it might make some people flinch, quality prevails! Well, I don't know if she is a &quot;story-telling genius&quot; like some of the book-covers say, but she is a natural storyteller with an abundance of talent, so again, her success was not based on pure luck, it had to happen.  As an adult, I was enthusiastic about this book, I can't even imagine what it would be like if I would have read this book as an eleven-year-old, I think I would have gone completely nuts. What qualifies this book as a children's novel? Only four things: The absence of sex (come on, the main protagonist is eleven years old!) and overt violence (which would be out-of-place in this novel anyway), that the main characters are children (who cares?) and that the book-covers are aimed at children (if you're ashamed to be seen with one of those, just buy the adult editions). All the other elemnts can and will be enjoyed by adults, too. The only people to whom I cannot recommend this book are those who prefer &quot;ultra-realistic&quot; dramas, they will have problems with wands, spells and owls delivering the mail. To anyone else whose imagination is still intact, try this, you will not be disappointed. After closing this book, I immediately picked up book two, so if you're interested if it is as good as this one, check my review there.

Should &quot;Christian&quot; parents let their kids read this book?
<br>Many Christian parents I know are, for obvious reasons, uncomfortable about the subject matter of this book.  However, even as a Christian parent, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't see any evil intent here.  It's just a fun book for kids to read, that will help them to see their own value and &quot;empowerment&quot; even in an adult world.<p>I especially liked that the book portrayed, in broad strokes, a wide array of stereotypical adults and kids that my child will likely run into throughout childhood.  An example of this is Professor Snape, who (spoiler alert) opposes and apparently hates Harry throughout the book, but ultimately is revealed as his protector.  What child doesn't have a particular teacher or adult in their life, who they are convinced hates them, when in fact that adult, in their own way is simply looking out for the child's best interests?  <p>The story also provides subtle lessons in sticking up for yourself without sinking to the level of those tormenting you, - and also about perseverence and doing the right thing.  This is a valuable lesson for kids having to deal with bullies at school, or for the kid who is not part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.  What I liked most was that Harry Potter himself was essentially an &quot;everykid&quot;, who perseveres and overcomes, but does not compromise what he believes in to attain acceptence.<p>For those Christian parents with concerns about the supernatural trappings which provide the backdrop against which the action unfolds, - it should be noted that there is a clear distinction between those who are on the good side and those on the &quot;dark side&quot;.  So, at least symbolically, it can be argued that that Harry Potter is a crusader against evil and his magical gifts (again symbollically) can be likened to spiritual gifts that God provides us with to help us resist and fight against the evil in this world.<br>

Children are READING, that's what's IMPORTANT!
I am a teacher of German in an elementary school.  At the beginning of this school year I began seeing Harry Potters books in my student's hands.  As the year progressed, I was noticing how reluctant they were to put their  books down when I was starting class.  They would stand up from the reading  center in their classroom and read all the way to their desks.  I finally  decided two weeks ago to find out what these books were all about.<p>I read  the first book in 5 days, the second book in 4 days and I've just started  the third book.  I also just finished reading several hundred reader  reviews here at Amazon.com.  I simply do not see the harm in these books!    My joy is that children are READING, children who before these books didn't  have any interest in reading.  And when they finish the Harry Potter books  they are continuing to pick up other books and read them.<p>I teach in a  school full of Southern Baptists, Catholics, Protestants, and other  religiously-raised children.  They are reading for the pure joy of reading,  not because they are being drawn into a world of satanic rites and occultic  rituals.  None of my students have aspirations of becoming witches and  wizards.  These books are works of FICTION and they realize that!<p>If we  must, let's look at the original versions of the Grimm Fairy Tales.  Those  stories were violent and blood-filled, often leaving the 'bad guy' killed  in some gruesome fashion.  Yet those are some of the timeless classics we  now encourage our children to read.<p>Let's look past some of the 'hidden  meanings' people are seeing in these books and rejoice in the fact that our  children are READING!

From one who never meant to read Harry Potter
I'm 24 years old, I never wished to read Harry Potter at all, and on top of all that (if one life can thus be reduced)I am a literature student, and have been for over 5 years now. So while I don't claim to write a learned review, I'm supposed to know what is good literature. <br /><br />How did I get this book? A friend offered it to me for my birthday. I was surprised because I had never been very interested in all the hype around that little Potter person, and I had never even seen any of the movies. I'm generally not a biased person but I admit I expected this novel to be "children literature" as they say. But things turned out quite unexpectedly...<br /><br />For one, no matter how many people have called this "children literature", it isn't. That label is way too belittling for a work of that kind. I'm not a kid, being 24, but I loved the book all the same. It has all the elements of a really great novel; rich characters, a plot that does catch your attention, a whole universe that is just awesome, magic, wonderful - and I could add more adjectives. Also, and this is important for those of you who think this is just a kid's book, there is a lot of dark things in the novel. Take the fact that Harry's parents are murdered. Well that alone is quite something. I mean, you definitely WILL feel sad about that sooner or later in the book. <br /><br />As to the writing per se, Rowling is very witty, funny, and seriously intelligent. I did laugh often and I smiled even more. This is a very touching story and it is incredibly rich on all aspects. I am really glad to find out that Harry Potter is a quality work and not the cheap novel I expected. I think this is really good and when I think of the millions of kids (and others) around the world who get into this, well I am glad, because this is good stuff, to say it in not very academic words. <br /><br />I would say that if you usually enjoy Gothic novels, fairy tales, or simply great books, then you should give a chance to Harry Potter. You will not regret it. Or better, offer it to a friend of yours, so you won't have to read it yourself, and your friend will read it because it was a gift. Then your friend will convince you that you must read it too. And then after all this, you will thank me for this review!

Can I Even Begin with them?
When I first picked up this book it was the christmas of 1998.  My mom had given it to me, and actually, i didn't want to read it.<p>How wrong I was.<p>Can I even start to explain the world and even life style that Harry has led me into.  Its entertaining, funny, and there are many references to mythology that Rowling cleverly weaves in.  It really just hooks you into a new world.<p>The story, which i'm sure you've heard already, is Harry Potter is the boy who survived the attack of the Dark Wizard Voldemort when he was a baby.  Growing up with his muggle (non-magical) aunt, uncle, and cousin, it is a shock for him when he learns he's a wizard.<p>This lovely, engaging world Rowling has created leads us in bit by bit.  And, its actually a quick read for u lazy people :( who don't wanna read a lot.  <p>The whole series is wonderful.  I love how Rowling is able to make the reader feel that Harry is growing up as he gets older in the books.  Like, the first book, the plot and vocabulary and psycology of it is fairly simple.  It gets more complex further in the books.<p>And then theres me, with my problem with obsessing over every last detail.  Ask me trivia, and i know it.  I've read those books way too many times!

Look past the hype and give this a chance!
I confess. I was way too cool for Harry Potter. I thought anything that could appeal to so many people had to be a little too simplistic for intellectual-smarty-pants me. I was so completely wrong. This book brought me back to my days tearing through books as a child, and made me remember why I learned to love to read in the first place. The story is beautifully written and captivating, with a hero one can whole-heartedly cheer for. (How long has it been since you read &quot;adult&quot; fiction like that?) If you liked &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; or the Narnia Chronicals as a kid, and you have been putting off picking this up because you think it is perhaps beneath you, I beg you to discover how wrong you are as well.

Harry Potter is for all
As a writer, I'm not ashamed to admit I have a great liking for Harry  Potter novels. The books are magical and enchanting. They have a charm and  appeal to them like no other series I've seen in a long while. Each of the  novels (particularly this one)are superbly written by a talented author.     Therefore, I fail to see the need for the negative criticism and bans  placed upon these wonderful novels. However, I suppose each person is  entitled to their own view. For the majority of people, the view is HARRY  POTTER IS THE BEST! So young and old alike pick up this wonderful novel  today

A magical book
I heard so much about Book 4 in the series through the media, especially the Today Show's Katie Couric, I had to go online and see what the hype was all about.  After reading several reviews I decided that I would order all  four books and read them in the correct sequence.  I am a mother of  five-year-old twins and a 12-year-old stepson, and felt that if the books  were as good as everyone says, the books could be passed to all of the  children in time.<p>Book 2 arrived first and after reading a few chapters I  knew right away that I had made a good decision in ordering the set.  The  other three books arrived a few days later and (though it was hard) I put  book 2 down and picked up Book 1.  I have just finished Book 1 and I can't  wait to get to Book 2 in the series.  Any book that gets children out from  in front of the television and the computer has to have some merit.  I  found the book very interesting, hard to put down, and nothing offensive or  immoral in the book, keeping in the mind that it is to be read as fiction  and not fact.  The series, according to reviews, becomes darker in the  later books, but this particular book was not dark at all.  The names of  the people and places are very whimsical and entertaining.  J K Rowling's  ability for description is amazing.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is an excellent book for all ages and I would definitely urge everyone to read it.  The author has put together a sensational plot with extraordinarily fascinating  characters that hook a reader on the story.  I started reading the book and  could not stop.  The wizards, the magic, and the Quidditch (the favorite  sport of all wizards in which the players fly on broomsticks trying to  score goals with five balls) just kept me reading. Harry, the main  character of the story, is forced to live with his controlling aunt and  uncle after his parents died.  When Harry is eleven he finds out that he is  a wizard and is sent to the Hogwarts School of Magic, for witches and  wizards.  He undergoes many adventures throughout his time at school, which  earn him honor and respectability. At first I was embarrassed to be reading  Harry Potter, which my mom said I would enjoy, as it is a book recommended  for ages five to twelve - I'm sixteen.  My younger brother, who isn't a big  reader, read this book in a couple of days, straight.  We couldn't get him  away from it.  I thought if he liked it so much then I guess I would enjoy  it too.  Was I in for a big surprise!  It is the best book I have ever read  and I can't wait to read the next two!

Definitely worth buying
After reading the original of the recent hits and chart-topping Harry Potter series, I just had to read the second. It once again begins over summer vacation and takes Harry to his second year at Hogwarts, the best  wizarding school of the day. But for some reason, people begin to be  attacked by someone - or something. Harry, Ron, and Hermione start on  another slew of detective work to find out what's going on, and how to save  the students of Hogwarts...it's hard to give a plot summary without  exposing the secrets of the ending, which, by the way, was a total  surprise!<p>This book is truly engrossing, more intense and frightening  than the first. I loved it! It was both fun and funny, much like the other  two in the series. It is interesting to read, and I honestly think it  appeals to all ages. Even older readers will enjoy being taken back to the  days when the line between fantasy and reality was blurred, and all the  books would keep any modern teenager enthralled. Harry Potter No. 2  actually kept me laughing throughout. At some points in the middle, the  story may get slightly bland, but don't worry: the best part is yet to  come. I love children's stories, have read many, and these are the best,  most modern works out there. There's a reason they are so hot right now,  and all these other 5-star reviews are deserved! This series breaks the  ordinary mold of children's books which are not always written with the  same flair J.K. Rowling successfully incorporates into the plot, and they  each possess their own sense of magic, not allowing the reader to put the  book down! The Harry Potter books are highly recommended! Other children's  authors I enjoy are Roald Dahl, Louis Sachar, Mark Twain, C.S. Lewis, and  E.B. White.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry, a twelve year old boy is continuing another fascinating year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.  This second book in the J.K. Rowling series is a must read!   Not only do the main characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione  Granger set out to solve a new problem but, they realize that somebody has  opened the Chamber of Secrets.  Through trial and error our heroes search  for clues to save one of their friends.  Again Harry must put his life in  danger to save others who are important to him.          J.K. Rowling has  introduced us to some new characters in book two.  We meet a magical elf,  Dobby, a new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart and finally Ginny Weasley, Ron's  younger sister who joins the famous trio.        I liked this book because  it was a true page turner.  As the reader you can search for possible clues  along with Harry, Ron and Hermione.  I would recommend this book to anyone  over seven years old. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job on this book  because it's exciting and full of adventure. I have learned from this book  that life is full of tough challenges and problems.  No matter how hard it  is you have to be brave and trust in yourself to do the right thing.

Amazing!
I was doubtful when I started the Harry Potter books- in fact I was only going to read them because a friend begged me to do so. Much to my surprise, I was immediately hooked on the first novel, and finished all  three within a week. I can honestly say that the three Harry Potter books  are among the best books I've ever read. I now recommend them to everyone-  children and adults alike. They're thoughtful, original, suspenseful, and  humorous- everything you could ask for in an adult's novel. I'm 17 years  old, and I never thought I'd be reading kids' books. But now I'm glad I  did- don't miss out on these amazing books, especially the third one. The  Chamber of Secrets is by far the best of the three books. Rowling explores  new dimensions of Harry's world and reveals the secrets readers have been  dying to know since the first book. This book leaves you hanging for the  fourth novel, which is sure to also be incredible!

A really cool book
I think the Harry Potter books are really fascinating. They are full of suspense and irony. I wouldn't have read this book because I thought it was for younger kids ( I'm 13)but my friend was reading it so I gave it a try. I didn't put the book down until I finished it. It was that good! I don't  want to be rude either but it really does not promote witchcraft. The whole  time I read it, using black magic never crossed my mind. I know parents can  be overprotective about that stuff but what about JRR Tolkien's Hobbit  series and Disney movies with witches and wizards in them. SLeeping Beauty  and Snow White and the 7 dwarves show this.  Most stories or movies have a  villian that is either a sorcerer or a witch. I thought this book was  really awesome and even if you are above the age of the Reading Level read  it anyway!  I love Harry Potter: he is really responsible and smart.  He is a good example. His friends are really funny and so are all the other  characters. This is really good literature. Thank you so much Ms. Rowling  for writing these books.

BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!

The AUDIO versions let the whole family share Harry Potter!
Want to end the TV addiction in your family?   Get a copy of the audio versions of the Harry Potter books and you'll never know what hit you! <p>Every kid who drives in our car wants to move to our house!   My  daughter and I have been listening to the first and second Harry Potter  books (Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets) on both audiotape and CD  for weeks and weeks now.  By that, I mean, that once we finish one, we put  the other one on, and have continued to go back and forth at her request.  <p>I don't know how long this can last, but I agree that nothing else quite  measures up afterwards!   The reader, Jim Dale, is somehow able to  communicate at least one or two DOZEN characters without any duplication  and perfectly captures the style and personality of each of the characters  without any loss of how you imagine them.  What a treat! <p>Each character  has a perfectly appropriate voice and tone and loses absolutely nothing  from the book.  Quite the contrary, we are both hearing new things that we  must have missed the first time we read the books as we are endlessly  entertained and amused.<p>We listen whenever we are driving in the car, or  drawing or doing crafts, while laughing out loud, crying, and giving each  other funny looks!<p>We have even found ourselves sitting outside the  movies, lessons, and our own driveway, without being able to move until we  come to the end of a chapter.<p>No matter how many times you have read the  books, I guarantee the audio versions will give you a new perspective on  the stories and/or reveal something which you didn't already know from your  reading.  Besides, it is a pleasure separate and apart from reading the  books yourself.  The art of reading out loud is not entirely lost--you only  have to listen to these audiotapes to realize that the TV can never compete  with this type of reading out loud!   Share this with your family--YOU'LL  NEVER LOOK BACK!

Clever sequel, a must-buy
As a die-hard fantasy fan who has long outgrown his childhood, I first eyed the Harry Potter books with askance.  They seemed to me to be more  suitable for little kids and hardly the material that an adult would read,  especially one who has long since been jaded by the typical fare produced  by Tolkien-esque authors drawing upon Celtic-Nordic traditions.<p> However,  I was soon persuaded by the many positive reviews of this series, both by  my friends and by book critics everywhere.   The first book I could not put  down until I finished it; the sequel ensnared me just the same.<p> While  the fantasy genre is composed of hackneyed plots and themes, regurgitated  by the many different authors out there, each cranking out thousand page  novels, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone proved that succinctness is  indeed a virtue.  All of the stereotypes are here, but instead of just  rehashing the same old fare that Tolkien dished out, Rowling re-defines it.    And while many readers, especially those, like me, who are well-read in  this genre, will recognize in Rowling's novels elements that have appeared  in countless other stories and myths, Rowling does not use these as  crutches to drive her story where none existed; rather, these are bridges  she uses to communicate to her readers, common archetypes that exist in the  minds of all.  Hers is far more than one author's interpretation; it is a  book that has captured the imagination and echoes the awe of the fantastic  that resides within all of us<p> Seldom has an author written with such  clarity that her words flow so smoothly from the page into our thoughts.   The fantasy genre owes its revival in large part to Rowling's gift of gab.   Instead of alienating most readers as many other authors do, Rowling  appeals to the mundane, beckoning them, in their own language, to visit the  world of the incredible, the fantastic, the impossible that nevertheless  seems so real.<p> Harry Potter is a character of the new millennium, and  his exploits usher in a new philosophy of fantasy.  An orphaned child  living in adverse conditions, Harry discovers that he is truly  extraordinary; he is a wizard.  Thus begin his adventures and his escape  from his cruel life.  He makes us all seek within ourselves that spark of  magic that will allow each of us to transcend the mundanity and normalizing  pressure of society, to become true individuals, unique to one another, and  special, each in our own way.<p> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  continues the tradition--yes, tradition, even after a single book!--of  Rowling's novels.  Engaging and funny, clever and entertaining, the sequel  further develops the world in which Rowling has set for her Harry Potter  novels, one much like ours but influenced by wizards who move behind the  scenes, unsuspecting to the common person.  Harry displays the unflagging  spirit of determination in the face of adversity, as even his friends  slowly turn against him.  Rowling's novel teaches children the value of  courage, intelligence, and morality while reminding adult readers of the  same.  Continuing her excellence, Rowling crafts a fantasy series perhaps  one day as defining as Tolkien's contribution to fantasy literature.   Certainly, it is a worthy addition to everyone's bookshelves, young and old  alike.

A wonderful surprise!
I was reading my kid brother a bedtime story when he suggested that we should try the Harry Potter books next. I was doubtful, having never heard of them before, but when he left one lying on the kitchen table I had a  look, and the next thing I knew, I was halfway through the book! I couldn't  put it down. Harry's unusual adventures caught my imagination. Plenty of  twists and laughs, as well as suspense and tension. And the characters are  great! Since then, I've heard a lot about the series, all wonderful, and  many comments on how much the parents seem to like them too...

Excellent!
J.K Rowling has written a series of books reminiscent of works by J.R.R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and R.A. Salvatore.  I am 25 years old and I was surprised to find Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets such an  enjoyable read!  Rowling's use of words conjures up a highly enjoyable  world, where you become quickly attached to the heroes therein.  The story  is masterfully woven and leaves even the most astute reader looking back  several pages to find the clues that they initially paid no attention to.   One of the best books I have read in many a year!

If you liked this. . . .
If you like the Harry Potter books, then definitely take a look at any books by John Bellairs!  He's no longer with us, but his tales were well written tales of fantasy, magic and adventure.  They fed my imagination  when I was younger, and now that I have nieces and nephews that love Harry  Potter, I have passed along the Bellairs books to them.  They love them  just as much as the Potter books, and while they're waiting for the next  Harry adventure, they pass the time reading the extremely fascinating  Bellairs stories.  And they're books the parents will love too!

Harry Potter's true adventures begin...
After introducing us to Harry Potter and his new life at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry author J.K. Rowling is able to expand on her idea. In &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; she had to spend a lot of time getting us accustomed to Harry's world, but now we can enjoy it along with  a richer plot and more developed narrative and characters. And what a plot!  I was under the impression that these were completely dumbed down, G-rated  kid-friendly books but there is a definite dark side to them. It's nothing  that will give kids nightmares or anything, but it is a little creepy. I  couldn't put it down I was so drawn in, and finished it easily the first  day I got it. It's very hard to pull yourself away from. I think that if  you are a parent you should read these books aloud to your children. Some  of my most cherished childhood memories are my father reading to us, and  this is the sort of book that we would have loved. You will enjoy it on  your own, but I imagine that it would be a more fulfilling experience  shared with the whole family.

Harry Potter- In my View
Hello. My name is Katie Potter. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was about the best book I have ever read. With full detail and great, capturing words I felt like I was in Harry's little group, or it  painted a picture in my head, more like a movie. As I said again, I love  this books and all of the other, tremendously written Harry Potter books by  J.K. Rowling.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
This book should be from ages 9 to adult.  It is excellent!  There are so many positive life lessons in these books I can only believe that those that challenge its subject matter didn't read them or take life way to  seriously.  I would like to see some middle school english classes study  these books and realize it is ok to be different.

Harry Potter is #1!
I gave this book 5 stars because it was the best story I've read in about 2 years. I liked how the book was action-packed.  The author gave good descriptions of the characters.  Also if you like mysteries, this would be a good book for you!

Kids preferred Harry Potter over NINTENDO!
Harry Potter is visually very appealing. Fast paced and witty, kids just won't put it down. The character of Harry is a little flat, however he  still engages the reader's sympathy. Highly recommend, particularly the UK or Canadian versions which reflect the author's original intent.

The Tale of Everything The First Book Never Did Answer
Harry Potter, the famous wizard in training, is back in the sequel to the popular first novel. In this book, Ms. Rowling's imaginative language and skills are brought out as in the first book. In this story, however, Harry find himself visited by a house-elf named Dobby, slave to the Malfoys. He warns Harry about going back. Of course, Harry doesn't listen (does he ever?). What could be worse than the Dursleys? Obviously, everything. A new, conceited professor, Lockhart, shows up, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, a new ghost, Moaning Myrtle haunts the girls bathroom, and someone is turning students into stone! In addition to that, Lockhart has a bad impression of Harry as an ego-maniac, and Hagrid, the gamekeeper, has secrets to tell. Of course, Harry is back to Quidditch, which he's most looking forward to, only to discover that mean, stuck-up, (and a personal favorite of mine!)Draco Malfoy has become the Slytherin seeker using his fathers money, (conviently turns out to really be bad at Quiddtich) and has the newest broomstick- a Nimbus 2001! Now, after all he's been through, everyone suspects Harry of truning them into stone! Muggle-borns now fear him and call him 'Heir of Slytherin'. Among the turned-stone students is Harry's friend Hermione Granger! No one believes him-not even Ron! How can he prove that it's not him, become the Quidditch champion, catch the criminal, handle many new characters (and old ones) and still survive? He's Harry Potter! Read the book and find out!

Vividly imaginative, provokes wonder in the reader!
I have read all three of the Harry Potter books and anxiously await the fourth.... I love the books, my children love the books. The only problem is that my daughter is mad at me because I kept reading ahead when she went  to school! (we were reading it together, but I just couldn't put them  down! ) I thank J.K. for creating such an imaginative world that intices  children away from the TV and video games and allows them to get lost in  visions of quiddich matches and Hogwarts feasts. Bravo! I have seen so many  wonderful Harry Potter inspired projects displayed in my children's school.  These books are making children create their own visions rather than depend  on those transmitted on TV! Buy the set for your families! You won't regret  it.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
This was one of the best books I have ever read.  In my ninteen years of life I have never been much of a reader...until I picked up this book!   I bought it as a Christmas present for my 9 year old brother....and I read the whole thing before he did.  This book contained all the childhood  fantasies I'd ever dreamed of.  I loved it, and now I own the complete set  of books 1, 2 and 3.  I applaud J.K. Rowling for her wonderful imagination  and for the descriptive ways she puts it into words!   I will treasure  Harry Potter always, and one day share it with my children!

A book for all ages!
I'm a 15 year old girl who got hooked on Harry Potter books by reading them to the girls that I babysit for. In fact, I'm borrowing the 3rd book in the series from the girls tonight! I read the first two books in two  days- they're great. While I did feel a little embarassed realizing that  they're books written for 12 year olds, that didn't stop me. The plot lines  are great, and both of the first books have endings you'd never see coming!  The only drawback is that they make our lives seem more boring! Great book,  great gift, great fun!

Wonderful at any age !
I only have one comment to make about those who feel this bookis in some way objectionable for children to read....  TRY IT YOURSELF!  I am a born again Christian and find nothing objectionable in this book .. it is fiction a fairy tale of the highest order ... LIGHTEN UP!  No where in the BIBLE do I read... LET THEE NOT HAVE AN IMAGINATION or thee will go astray ... NO this is a book ment for fun SO ... LET there be FUN.... They talk about witchs and warlocks ok so what ... DO lions really talk ?  would you put down C.S. LEWIS ?  One of the greatest of the Christian fiction writers ... GIVE kids a break ... let them have a Harry potter book .. it will not stain their souls but amuse them and it will give them hope...  THERE IS GOOD in the world that NO EVIL thing can KILL...

The magic's back!
I read the first Harry Potter book voraciously,hoping the next ones would be as enchanting. Ms. Rowling delivers in this sequel. I haven't experienced such a child-like sense of wonder and joy from reading a book  in years! This one is meant for all ages,not just children. Harry's a  wizard,but has everyday problems just like us &quot;Muggles&quot;. The  Harry Potter series is fun and unique. Most 300 pg books aren't interesting  enough to make you want to finish them in a day.  And the Harry stories  aren't Satanic,as some people say. I'm from a Christian family that's  hopelessly devoted to them. No Harry fans have been reported practicing  occult rituals. Parents don't have to censor these novels. They actually  teach moral messages,but in a non-preachy way. If you want a book series  that's guaranteed to be good,that you won't feel you've wasted days of your  life on,try Harry Potter.

Greatest Set of Books I've ever read
I'm 14 years old, and I these books are awesome!  Harry comes back yet again with Ron and Hermione.  I actually think that these should be for all ages, not just up until twelves.  This book is very thrilling and is great to read.  I recommend this book to whoever can read!  Those of you whom  your parents won't let you read it: info: Go &quot;study&quot; in the  library!  It's worth it, trust me.  Those of you who live for fantasy, and  great books, these books are for you!     Parents: Lay off a little.  These  books aren't evil.  They teach the quite kids to stand up for themselves,  troublesome kids to cool down, and studious children to chill out and have  fun.  This book is great for your children and you!

Harry Potter Doesn't Teach Witchcraft
Okay, here's the scoop. I attend Church every Sunday and I have read the entire Bible. I have also read all three Harry Potter Books, and, quite honestly, there is nothing in any of them that teaches Witchcraft as a religion. Yes, Harry and his friends have magic wands and take classes in  Potions and Transfiguration, but there is no subtle message in these books  that Magic replaces God. These books don't teach witchcraft, but they do  teach something else, something our society is sadly lacking. Morals.  Besides how to turn toads into tadpoles, Harry learns the value of  friendship, the importance of loyalty, the price of deceit. True, Harry  does break school rules, but sometimes, you have to break the rules to do  what is right. (For all you religious fanatics, think Jesus breaking the  Pharisees's Laws) One more tidbit to add. You can't judge a book by its  cover...or its summary. Before you judge Harry, read the first book with an  open mind and heart. Then decide whether or not to let your children read  this.

Excellent reader tool for your kids!
Forget the hype that this is an evil book for children to read!  These books are wonderful fantasty stories about good vs. evil, done in tongue and cheek...and by the way, Good Wins!  My 12 year old could care less  about reading and it was showing in his grades.  I was able to challage him  to read a chapter in the evening.  I would read it that night and we would  discuss it.  It became a race to see who could finish it first and get the  next book!  We talk in codes about the book [so the &quot;muggles&quot;  don't understand us].  He even got his grandmother to read all the books  too.  His reading grades have improved and float between A's &amp; B's!    WE can't wait for the next book(s)!  Get these books..HIDE THEM..so you can  read them before your kids!  EXCELLENT!

Became a fan after the movie...
I had heard about the fantasy books by a friend when they first came out but didn't have the time to look into them. By the time the movie came out, I'd nearly forgotten about the book referral, but asked my hubby to take me as it looked like a good vampire romance flick. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest forests, rivers, and coastline was breathtaking and as a native to this area, it was like going out into my own backyard which made the film that more appealing. I was so captivated by the actors portrayal of the characters (the facial expressions and emotions brought out of the characters by Rob, Kristen, Peter, Nikki, and the rest were mesmerizing) and the depth of the back-story left me desiring more! The very next day after viewing the movie in the theater - I raced to the bookstore to grab the first book. I was hooked, read through all four books (plus went to the authors website to read the extra materials she had posted there) in a week. Then, still not satisfied, went back and saw the movie several more times - IN THE THEATER, something I've never felt compelled to do before - because I was so drawn to the characters and the story. This may have been written for the young adult audience but I'm 32 and a parent of four children, and still found the story to be well worth my time. <br /><br />If you haven't read the stories, I encourage you to do so. Regardless, this film will be a treasured part of your movie collection and one you'll be sure to watch several times before you'll feel satisfied.

Obsessing over Twilight and can't wait for the DVD!!
I came into the Twilight series not expecting much. The books were, after all, marketed to the teen crowd, so I originally dismissed it.  I didn't expect much from the film.  I wanted to see it not for the story, but because I knew Robert Pattinson from "Harry Potter" and enjoy the vampire book/movie genre.  <br /><br />4 books and 7 viewings later, I am happy to report that I am now a happily obsessed "Twilighter."   <br /><br />Going into the movie, I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. As soon as the Cullen siblings walked through the cafeteria door, I knew I was in for the ride. And by the time Edward and Bella were sitting together at the restaurant in Port Angeles, I was smitten. The love story, the beautiful vampires, and the amazing chemistry between leads Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, made this film - for me - utterly irresistible. I knew I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over, and the female relatives that I went to see it with couldn't agree more.<br /><br />7 viewings later, I am still obsessed.  Like "Titanic" and all the wonderful Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell tv/movie adaptations before it, I was enthralled by the love story of Edward and Bella. Edward Cullen, a 108 year old vampire trapped in the body of a 17 year old, falls in love for the first time...to a human - a young unsuspecting girl named Isabella Swan.  Bella becomes equally fascinated by Edward, and this mutual fascination soon grows into yearning and love.  Theirs is a Romeo & Juliet like love story but this time it's not a family feud that keeps them apart, but the fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella is a human - the predator and the prey fall in love (or as Edward puts it, "...and so the lion falls in love with the lamb").  Within the story are some other conflicts, as Edward and his family's true nature must remain a secret, and as other vampires threaten Bella's life.<br /><br />Author Stephenie Meyer has crafted an irresistible tale, and screenwriter Rosenberg Melissa Rosenberg does a fine job of staying faithful with the novel. Some scenes and plotlines are changed around or omitted in order to make it work on film, but the essentials are there.  Director Catherine Hardwicke does a superb job of bringing all the elements together and guiding her young cast through the journey, so I was saddened to hear that she will not be helming the sequel.<br /><br />The major breakthroughs in this film, however, are the young and talented leads - Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. What started out as a small independent film has now become a worldwide phenomenon and has catapulted Rob and Kristen to the brink of superstardom.  And this is no accident.  The charismatic and versatile Robert Pattinson is brilliant as Edward. He properly conveys the internal conflict that rages within Edward and brings it out in full force.  When he's onscreen, you couldn't take your eyes off him.  His Edward can be gentle, loving and tender, but also fearsome and dangerous.  Kristen Stewart brings a beautiful and nuanced performance.  She is exactly how I pictured Bella and she does an excellent job of bringing the character to life.  The supporting cast is also wonderful.  Of the supporting roles, Billy Burke (Charlie Swan), Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen), Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) are standouts. I think everyone - with the exception of Nikki Reed's Rosalie Hale/Cullen (who I feel just doesn`t fit Rosalie physically) - are perfectly cast.<br /><br />I am also a fan of the soundtrack and Carter Burwell's amazing score, and I highly recommend purchasing these as a companion to the dvd.  I am thrilled that the dvd is finally coming, and I although the final specs are not yet available, I hope that Summit Entertainment will release a dvd version filled with extras, deleted/extended scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.  I'm a huge fan of the books and I feel that the cast and crew of Twilight has done an amazing job of bringing one of my favorite books to life.  I'm looking forward to New Moon, and I hope that it will be as good as, if not better than, the first film.  This film is a gem and one of my favorite love stories ever. Bella and Edward has joined the ranks of Elizabeth and Darcy, John Thornton and Margaret Hale, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, Cathy and Heathcliff,  Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater, and yes Romeo and Juliet, as two of my very favorite romantic couples that has ever graced the big and small screen.<br />

Enjoy The Movie For What It Is..
Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helps understand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I've seen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. But hey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wide age range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job and can't wait for New Moon.

Absolutely Amazing
This movie created a whole new obession that started with the books in the twilight series. It started with my 14 year old "teen" son saying I had to get a book for him. Well, that was a few weeks before the movie was released. As word traveled and the buzz about the upcoming movie approached. I read his book. I made it to the movie a few days after it was out. I loved it. But did not expect to see it again until it came out on DVD. Then I read the rest of the books in the twilight series. And somehow I was drawn back to the movie a week later. I felt like I was in Bella's head and needed to see the flick again. I left with more appreciation than the first time. I started to think more about the film and books. The love story alone makes you want more. When Edward says to Bella,"You don't know how long I have waited for you" your heart skips a beat and your body goes numb. I got the movie companion at a local store. I was surprised at the low budget. I also started to see "why" the director did what she did in the movie. Why the vampire's running or tree climbing wasn't the special effects we are used to in this day in age. I started to fall in love with the essence of the movie for what it really is. I am in a trance every time I see it. I am addicted to the characters, story line and every possible crumb of the twilight world. I have seen the movie for the 10th time tonight. Every time I see it, I am still amazed at the way Catherine has brought it to light. Yes, somethings are left out from the book. Yes, scenes are different than described in the book. However, the script has word for word from the book thoughout here and there. To take a book and make a movie on a limited time and budget, and capture the audience is a tall order. To deliver a movie that has already been perfected in a reader's mind is even more difficult. The movie follows the story line smoothly and is one of the best book to movie adaptions I have seen in a long time. I believe that Robert's acting was spellbinding. He is Edward Cullen. I am amazed how he embraced and captured the character of a 100 something year old vampire so realisticaly for a 22 year old young actor. His facial expression's alone express the emotion's that Edward has for Bella. You leave the theatre wanting more! To see the movie without reading the books may leave you with a limited vision of what is behind the story.But over all you should love the movie no matter what. The movie is my favorite and I am now a very twilight-addicted married mom of 3 boys.

Lovely, incandescent, sensual and captivating!
An unusual and lovely teen, Bella, reluctantly moves to live with her father in the misty, verdant forests of Washington State. Her first day of school goes well due to friendly classmates but then she encounters a young man, Edward, who glares at her with feral scorn--his black eyes sparkle with offense when she is near. She determines to confront his rudeness. But the next time she sees him he is oddly courteous and sincere. As they get to know one another Bella discovers that Edward has super strength and can even read minds. But when she is shocked by the icy cold of his hand she knows the truth. He is a vampire.  <br /><br />Edward's mystery, beauty and old-fashioned manners are irresistible to Bella. He makes a chivalrous attempt to stay away from Bella to protect her from the vampire world, but it is too late for both of them because are deeply in love. Bella and Edward have a forbidden love. They belong to warring families. Like Romeo and Juliet their passion is intensified by transgression against norms of their heritage.  Bella is relieved to learn that the family of vampires Edward is a part of is unusual; they are "vegetarian" vampires, meaning they only drink the blood of animals. <br /><br />Edward and Bella spend idyllic hours romancing in the mossy green redwood forests. Physical touching is almost impossible because Edward must continually fight against his fierce instinct to drink her human blood. But their hearts touch through their eyes. Edward's tender yet ardent courtship of Bella is poignant and tantalizing. Then Bella is threatened by becoming the target of a rogue predatory vampire. This predatory vampire is tantalized by the challenge of a battle of wits and skill against Edward and his family, who unite to protect Bella. <br /><br />Meyer's brilliant Twilight series introduced a fresh new vampire world into the genre. And in the movie the freshness continues. Filmed in gorgeous redwood forests, it is startling to see vampires in the sunlit meadows yet seeing them in light does not make them less mysterious or menacing. The young actors in this film are well cast; beautiful but unusual. Their characters are not shallow teens; these are complex young adults that care deeply about their lives, friends and family. Bella, played with intensity and verisimilitude by lovely Kristen Stewart, is a worthy and courageous hero who does not hesitate to put her own life in danger to protect her mother and her father. Despite the fact that she is just a frail human she fights back against supernatural and human predators. Edward is equally interesting as he is physically seventeen but is much older in years. Yet Bella is his first love and he is terribly concerned that he will cause her harm. Oddly handsome Robert Pattinson plays Edward with magnetism and aching vulnerability.  Kudos to the rest of the actors, particularly kind-faced Peter Facinelli as Carlyle, sensitive Billy Burke as Bella's father, captivating Justin Chon as Erik Yorkie, piquant Christian Serratos as Angela Weber, striking Gil Birmingham as Billy Black--I could go on and on the casting was excellent.  <br /><br />Brilliant director Catherine Hardwicke matched the beauty of the ancient forests with the emotional tone of the scenes with authority and confidence. Though I have not seen this director's other films I look forward to seeing her work. <br /><br />Twilight the movie has had to make choices to adapt Meyer's huge novel to the screen yet no sacrifice of quality has been made. The movie sensitively portrays the thoughtful and passionate characters created by Meyer while it enthralls and entertains with its contemplative beauty. Vampires symbolize the primal drives in all of us but in Twilight we are introduced to vampires who choose to put aside these urgent desires to avoid harm. Tender love and care are portrayed as the greatest power of them all. <br /><br />Seen it twice and can't wait to see it again.  An enthusiastic five stars--Twilight deserves to be a smash hit!

Amazon critic WAY off base
I just want to complain about the person who wrote the description/critique for Amazon. The person is so biased and ignorant of the allure of these books - this Twilight phenomenon. They aren't qualified to be writing the description. Of course they can dislike Twilight and its sequels if they choose -- but why in the world would they be chosen to write the blurb on the page where it sells? I'm not a kid -- no where NEAR that age -- and these books are as compelling to me as they are to my young daughter. There was humor in the movie for sure but certainly nothing "not" intentional. And to say the Edward Cullen role/actor is a simpering puppyish flaw played by Robert Pattinson: that's downright unbelievable. The writers mentality would surely have found the same silliness in the brooding angst of James Dean. It's no accident that Pattinson has become a world-wide star because of Twilight. He sizzles.   I just think reviews for a best selling book should be written by people who understand what they're reading.

Loosely based on the book, awesome in its own way...
I am a a huge fan (okay more like obsessed) of the Twilight Saga.  So I was so excited to see this on the big screen.  At first view, I was a little disappointed because its not like the book in many ways.  I liked it, but I sat in the theater and verbalized my frustration with the differences while watching.  After seeing it a second time, I decided I love Twilight the movie in a different way than I love the book.  It kind of makes it a whole other way for me to love Twilight.  I am so excited for New Moon and Eclipse to come out, and hopefully Breaking Dawn will soon follow as well on the big screen.  I totally recommend this movie, but you need to read the books to get the whole picture because the books are amazing.  This movie is loosely based on the book in my opinion, and does not do the book justice, but again, if you look at it as a different rendition of the book, its fantastic.  They were spot on with the casting as well.  Kudos on that factor!  All in all, great book, great movie, but not a great movie if you are looking for it to be just like the experience the book gives you.  Its a different experience entirely and I love both entirely.

Editorial Review of the Editorial Review
I'd like to give an editorial review of the Amazon Editorial Review.  Ouch!  Could you be more negative and condescending towards Twilight fans in your "Review" of the movie, "Twilight?"  What is up with that?  Geez!  May I suggest that you review the movie, not the caliber of people YOU think are "stupid" enough to enjoy it?  (ie. "...teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment.")  How insulting, and it reveals you know nothing of the character who is Edward Cullen, nor much about teens.<br /><br />BTW, the movie is awesome, and Robert Pattinson does a GREAT job throughout.

Leave the complaints about problems elsewhere and review the movie
This movie was epic. When you get a little older..of which I am 30 you think that movies made for a younger generation won't affect you. I was not expecting much from this movie but received alot. Even though I understood the premise there was so much more. The acting in this movie was superb and there are so many layers to the emotions being conveyed that it will take more than one viewing to get them. This movie was amazing and I would recommend to anyone.

The Hero In Romance is Everything--Behold Pattinson's Edward
I did not expect to like this movie.  For one, I think vampire love stories have been overdone to death.  Coppola's DRACULA, starring Gary Oldman, is one of my all time favorite movies and I really didn't need any pretenders to that throne.  This was before I saw Edward as played by actor Robert Pattinson.  In a nutshell, anyone who was ever a teenage girl will instantly grasp the appeal of this movie.  There you are leading the typical angst ridden teenage life when in walks this gorgeous supernatural being who is totally in love with you.  He lifts you out of your ordinary existence into an extraordinary one.  He woos you in extraordinary ways too, even flying you around your Pacific Northwest territory and watching you sleep with adoration on his face.  He never sleeps, of course.  I would be surprised if men liked this movie.  I think a guy would only watch it if his girlfriend insisted. He also has the considerable after viewing problem of measuring up to Edward/Pattinson, which will be pretty depressing.  The special effects are nicely done.  The female lead does a good job.  The plot is good vampires vs bad vampires, aside from the love story that is.  Absolutely no one would watch this movie though without  Edward/Pattinson.  I saw a recent poll on VANITY FAIR about the sexiest, most beautiful man in movies today.  Robert Pattinson just routed every other man of any age in movies today in that poll.  Everyone voted for him.  Since every woman was once a teenage girl, that is all you need to be to fall in love with this movie.  The last time I saw a video which had this kind of effect was when Colin Firth played Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  I am absolutely unsurprised TWILIGHT was directed by a woman, Catherine Hardwicke.  Being a woman who was once a teenage girl, I am sure she knew exactly how to proceed with this material.  I am tempted to give this less than 5 stars because I am rather ashamed I liked it this much.  It is a big guilty pleasure movie for me.  However, I then think, "Hey, I'm not a movie critic.  I can really, really enjoy something without being all torn up over artistic merit."  So the five stars stays.  We all need our guilty pleasures.<br />

The Complete Hardcover Twilight Saga
This set includes all the books from the Twilight Saga, which includes; Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and lastly Breaking Dawn. The books themselves are exactly likes the ones you find at any bookstore, in hardcover. The case it comes in has all the book covers displayed on each side minus the names of each book. <br />What is included that you couldn't normally get by buying each one individually elsewhere are 4 5x7-ish cards that have the cover picture on one side, then quotes from the corresponding book written on the other. for example: one 5x7 has a picture of the twilight cover, hands holding a red apple, then the other side it says, "About three things i was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him--and i didn't know how dominant that part of him might be--that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him." (I included some pictures so you can get a better idea of what they are)<br /><br />I would recommend this set to those who do not already own the twilight collection(like me) and would like to own all the books(i borrowed them all from a friend). Or of course obsessed twilight fans. There's nothing truly remarkable about the set so i wouldn't go buying this if you already own all the books. <br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase nonetheless. This saga is one of my favorites.

Gorgeous keepsake collection of all four books in the Twilight series!
This is a value buy for those who are contemplating sinking their teeth [pun intended] into Stephenie Meyers' Twilight series as it not only offers all four books, i.e. Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn for a great price, they all come housed in a gorgeous keepsake box. I have all four of the books in hardcover, but I purchased them individually as they were released, and am seriously contemplating getting this boxed set which I can keep as a souvenir, and then use the other books as my reading copies.<br /><br />Well, for those who are new to the series, the books are in the following order:<br />Twilight - Bella Swan moves to a small town near Seattle called Forks and meets Edward Cullen, an enigmatic student at her high school who turns out to be a vampire and lives with his clan in a magnificent mansion. As the romance between Bella and Edward blossom, they have to face obstacles such as the physical 'constraints' of being in a mortal-vampire relationship, facing objections from their respective families, and threats from other more vicious vampires.<br /><br />New Moon - Edward and Bella are parted and Bella is so heartbroken that her life becomes empty and without direction. Enter Jacob Black, the tall, dark and handsome friend from the reservation, La Push who provides Bella with not only friendship but someone she can trust and rely on during a desperate time. Of course, nothing in Bella Swan's life is ever quite so simple and complications crop up once again.<br /><br />Eclipse - Edward and Bella are back together, much to the disappointment and disgust of Jacob Black, himself now an other-worldly being. Will he convince Bella that he is more worthy of her love or will Edward prevail?<br /><br />Breaking Dawn - the final instalment in the series. Edward, Bella and Jacob feature prominently here, with the most pivotal question - will Bella sacrifice her mortality for an immortal life with Edward? If so, what are the repercussions?<br /><br />All in all, the Twilight series makes for an interesting and fun reading experience and this beautiful boxed set for the price offered here on Amazon is definitely a keepsake for fans and new readers alike!

If you love the Twilight Saga, Go Audio - LOVED It
The Twilight Saga is one of my favorite series.  I started this series reluctantly by being encouraged to read Twilight by a friend.  I checked it out of my local library and knew that I had to own it.  Half way through, I queued up New Moon and Eclipse to start immediately upon completion.  I then waited for the arrival of Breaking Dawn, which I completed the weekend it was released.<br /><br />I have all the books on this series in audio and 3 in print, but I have to say, I prefer the audio by far.  Ilayana Kadushin does a fabulous job giving Bella a voice and adds so much more depth and emotion to the story than I could personally get from print.  Matt Walters is introduced as Jacob in the Epilogue in Eclipse and Book 2 of Breaking Dawn.  He also does a great job of giving Jacob a voice. <br /><br />As for the series itself, I loved it.  Twilight, Eclipse are my favorites in this series, followed by New Moon and Breaking Dawn. I won't give an overview of the plot of each of the books as I won't be able to do them justice individually with limited words.  I will summarize series as a whole by saying the first 3 in this series are really about love, conflict, choices with a little bit of the supernatural and some action involved.  The last look in this series takes an unexpected turn and is more of a fantasy type novel with a little romance - different than what was laid out in the previous three books.  <br /><br />Breaking Dawn seemed to be received with more mixed reviews than the previous three because it deviated from the format laid out in the previous books. I had some mixed feelings about the story because of this, but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />This is a fabulous series that is aimed at young adults (mostly female) but has held the interest of adults like myself, and a smaller male audience as well.  While the last book in this series is quite a bit different than the previous 3, its still one of my favorite series.  <br /><br />It's not a literary masterpiece and certainly has flaws, but the story laid out out and the world created are absoultely fascinating and highly entertaining.  This is why is I think it deserves 5 stars....as well as the readers of the audio version.  Great performances.<br /><br />The audio version is definetly worth the extra expense.  If you loved the Twilight Saga, this is a must have in my opinion.

A great collection!
I bought this to have an untouched set of the books, as my original set has been a bit abused from loaning them out and my own obsessive reading!  The box is gorgeous [and sturdy!] with a cover picture of the books on the sides.<br /><br />The four lithographs are approximately 4 x 11.  Each one is the cover of the book [without any of the words].  The back of each has the blurb from the book it corresponds with, in the Twilight font.  They are a nice little addition to the set.<br /><br />All in all, if you were to buy the hardback versions separately, this boxed set is only a little more and you get the lithos with it.

Sweet and Intoxication!!!!
Actually I never heard about this saga before and yes I am not a big fan of the vampire thing though.  Eventhough I give it a try because I am really interested in the movie trailer and the release date is too far to wait.  <br /><br />I went to the bookstore got the box set on Tuesday evening and let say that I couldn't put it down and I was breezed through the whole set within 36 hours striaght.<br /><br />I really like the last book "Breaking Dawn" much more than the first "Twilight".  The story has been progress to the point that I feel that, Bella and Jacob, both have been grew up right before my eyes. I am not saying that the other books were not good but I do like the first and the last best. <br /><br />And for the Box Set, I think it is a bonus for all the collector. For my personal reading style, I love hardcover book most.  The covers that print on the each side of the box were added the charm to the collection (I heard that the fans didn't like the last cover "The White Queen" and "The Red Pawn" but I do like it.  I think it would have some meaning behind it and depend on each of the reader will interpreted the meaning. I won't tell mine. ;P)<br />  <br />Recommended to everyone.  These books really not only for teen but for everyone in the family.  For me, it's not only the perfect love, it's more like loyalty to family, friends and lot more.

There aren't sufficient words...
I am 42 years old, happily married, mother of 2.  When it was suggested to me by a friend that I read Twilight - a young-adult love story/vampire story - I laughed....literally.  No thanks.<br /><br />That same friend showed up on my doorstep with a paperback copy and left firm instructions...read it.  Period.  Then she left.<br /><br />In two days, I was hooked - completely obsessed, and in love with a 17 year-old vampire.  Well, a 100 year-old vampire, if we're going to get technical about it.  Before I was finished with Twilight, I was on Amazon.com ordering the boxed set.<br /><br />Merely a month later, and I am on my second round of reading the entire series.<br /><br />I am not going to insult anyone's intelligence and say these books rank up there with the classics - by they might, only time will tell.  Stephenie Meyer writes fluidly and beautifully - so much so, you feel you are there.  These characters are a part of your life - you almost believe in vampires and werewolves - they seem...plausible...after reading these books.<br /><br />BUY THEM!!  READ THEM!!! LOVE THEM!!!

Perfect Gift
My girlfriend and I have both read all the books through once. We both like to read books more than once, but we don't have our own copies of them. She has been borrowing from friends or borrowing from the library to read them. So her birthday was a few days before the movie came out and she was halfway through New Moon again, so before she had to borrow from someone else, i decided i would get her her own set for her birthday. when i ordered this box set it was only $45 which was 45% off the original price. I got it, it shipped in 1 day (i have prime, so it was free two-day, but still arrived in just one =D ) and everything was still in perfect condition. She absolutely loved it. I knew it would be a great gift for someone who never gets tired of reading books over, such as myself or her.<br />Great gift for fans of the saga.

The Twilight Saga
I loved the story. It changed and evolved just as life does. It amazingly even had morals that the characters upheld which I thought definitely should be applied to even today's time and was a good surprise. Loved Breaking Dawn even though it was a big change from the other 3. Thought it blended well; in that it showed that a fight is not always the answer needed to solve a problem.

Best series ever!
I absolutely loved this series. It is well written, consistent, and the characters are well thought out. I didn't want to put them down, and now that I've read them all I want to read them again.

Could not stop reading until I read them all!!!
I saw Twilight the movie first and on a whim I bought Twilight the book in paperback.  I had heard alot about how teenage girls and their mothers loved this series and why, and though I do not go for teen stories, I decided to check this out.  After I read Twilight and realized that I enjoyed the story, it was not long (not even a week later) that I was out buying the second book New Moon and days later I was ordering online Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.  The story arc draws you in and captures you to the point where you can not put the books down wanting to know what is going to happen next and whether Bella and Edward make it together as a couple and to see how they get through all the hurtles that are thrown their way by the antagonists within the story (who by the way are so interesting on their own that you want to know more about them and the world of Stephanie Meyer's vampires and their evolution).  Suffice it to say, by the time I finished reading this series I felt bereft that there was no more books and that the series and come to its end.  Very rarely do you find a series that is so engrossing.  I love vampire stories and have read quite a few fiction novels about vampires ... though I have heard alot of criticism about why the vampires of Stephanie Meyer's world stay out of sunlight, over all it is a small aspect of this series which can be easily overlooked.  The characters and the storyline and the vampirac history sustain this series so well that there is no doubt why it is so successful.

The Twilight Saga
Besides the obvious romantic theme in this series there are many other messages.  Such as:  acceptance of others, family relationships, getting over prejudices, spirituality, and following your dream.<br /><br />I am on my 3rd read of the series and each time brings new enlightenment and enjoyment.  Ms. Meyer has a wonderful writing talent and a fabulous gift for story-telling.  She puts you in the scene of the story on each page.

A Complete Surprise
Against my better judgement I watched the movie before reading the book. I just could not believe that I would enjoy this series, despite numerous people assuring me that I was wrong. After watching the movie, even with my complete an utter annoyance with all the dragged out emotions in the film, I decided I would give New Moon a try. I am so glad I did! I don't know what it is about this series that has completely sucked me into this world but I have been devoring all things Twilight, completly emotionally involved in these characters lives. And I hate romance novels! I recommend this series highly to all woman but I don't know if many men could put up with the constant describing of emotion in these books.

Couldn't put these books down
I absolutely devoured these books. It's rare to find a set of books that touch your soul but that's what happened for me.  The writing is not Shakespeare, the story isn't extremely deep, but the story is very compelling and the characters and relationships suck you in.  I'm a 40 year old woman and the story was as relevant and entertaining for me as for a young adult.  I definitely recommend the series, but make sure you have the time to read it straight through, because that's all you'll want to do.

Great Collection
I was skeptical at first to start reading the Twilight Saga, but after watching the first movie, I was curious as to what was going to happen in the rest of the series.  My friends assured me that if I liked the movie, that I would love the books even more.  They were correct.  The story-telling about the love between Bella and Edward was beautifully written.  At times I would find myself so sad, I would cry, so mad that I would want to stop reading all together, so happy I would scream and giggle like a little school girl!  To induce such feelings, to me, is a beautifully written series!

Twilight Series
after I saw the movie and heard all the hoopla about this book series, I decided to take the plunge and buy this set. I was not let down at all...<br /><br />this series is labeled for young adults, which I don't agree with. Stephenie Meyer wrote a story like she was painting a masterpiece. The story of Edward and Bella is the story of true love. a story I can relate to... she writes of the love they have for one another in such a way that it grabs you by the hand as she takes you for a walk thru Forks, WA and the humor, jealously, anger, heartbreak, and extreme love of two young kids looking for what all people around the world are looking for. someone to call their very own for eternity. and she does it such way I think you could almost compare it to Romeo and Juliet. I laughed out loud, cried openly and got very upset with some of the characters.<br /><br />I highly suggest this series to anyone young or old. you won't be let down.<br /><br />Thank You Stephenie for writing this. I'm a 38 yr old U.S. Marine who loved this so much, I have my entire family reading it.  there is at least 3 different sets in my home as I write this. BUY THIS SERIES!

Best Books Ever
I had already read all the books, but I wanted a collection, all in hardback, to keep for myself. The collection is exactly what I wanted and I am happily reading all the books a second time. These books are the best ever except for the Bible. Cleanest vampire books you'll ever read. And a wonderful love story.

Outstanding Reading
Once I started reading, I couldn't put the books down. I was up until 6am one day and only stopped when my eyes finally crossed. Well written, tastefully presented, and mesmerizing descriptions of all the characters. I felt I was there, standing in the rain, on the plaza in Italy, in the field playing ball. What an excellent writer. I can't wait to see the next film.

Twilight Case Set
I have received and now finished reading the Twilight series books. The presentation of the box set is great and is also sturdy so if your wanting to to keep the books in great condition the box will allow this. Initially I thought maybe the books would have been written for a teenage audience but found myself not be able to put them down. I just had to know what happened. After finishing reading all the books I am a little sad to leave Forks and have no idea what to do with my spare time now. Hopefully the movies will be just as awesome as the books.

Fantastic
I enjoy reading and when a book can suck you into the story and make you not want to do anything but finish the book, that is a good sign. I read all 4 books in a week, with working a full time job, taking care of the house, and cooking dinner every night! I could read these books time and time again! They are not just for the tween crowd for sure. They are for anyone who likes a good story or is, in my case, a hopeless romantic.

Fantastic books!
I used to work in a book store, so I actually read the first book, Twilight, right after it came out. It was the cover art that caught my attention, but after reading the first chapter I was totally hooked. Stephanie Meyer creates characters and story lines, that while there's no chance of experiencing them in real life, are extremely easy to imagine as being real. Each book just gets better and better and I recommend that someone who hasn't read any of the books yet, get the Twilight Saga book set because you're going to want to read them one right after the other!

Eclipse brings us back to Forks and Twilight
Twilight introduced us to Bella Swan and the mysterious Cullen's a family of vampires. New Moon pulled Bella and Edward Cullen apart, and tested their love and introduced us to Jacob and the battle between wolves and vampires. It also left us hanging with a decision about Bella and immortality: when?<br /><br />Eclipse is different. We return to the town of Forks and find that nothing much has changed. Graduation is closer than ever (after which, the Cullen's have agreed to make Bella a vampire) and a serial killer is loose in Seattle. Bella cannot see Jacob, her best friend because he is a Werewolf, and due to her ties to the vampires, it would break treaties and bonds made between them. <br /><br />As the days go by, and graduation gets closer and closer, Bella must choose her fate. She wants to become immortal and be with Edward, but she must give up her family to do so. She is also worried about the change: will she be able to be "vegetarian" like the Cullen Family, and refrain from human blood? Or will her new blood lust cause her to kill innocent people?<br /><br />The serial killer that is in Seattle turns out to be supernatural: newborn vampires on the loose. This brings up even more issues for Bella and her decision to become immortal. Not that anything could ever persuade her to give Edward up, but it makes the choice more difficult by showing her the realities of becoming a vampire.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plot: Jacob wants more from Bella too, which makes the choice even more difficult. Must Bella choose between the love of her life and her best friend? <br /><br />Eclipse is yet another installment of a series I desperately hope will continue. I want to continue watching the characters grow and change, and find out what their lives will unfold to be like. I am already anxious for the next in the series! Write more, Stephenie Meyer!

Obsession- Preface  of  Breaking Dawn and First Chapter
This review is about the first chapter and preface of Breaking Dawn - sold in the special edition of Eclipse.  Stephenie Meyer gives us a sneak peak into what looks to be another wonderful addition to the Twilight series.  The preface is intriguing and makes us wonder who Bella is with while she is thinking such dark thoughts.  Clearly, this is another book about obsession.  The first chapter is awesome.  We see Bella has matured and is walking toward her chosen path trying to keep her head held high.  The first chapter was unexpected as well.  What is great about the first chapter is that Bella is alone outside her house engaged in an activity.  Bella hasn't been alone since the middle of New Moon so this was an interesting scene.  <br /><br />This sneak peak also gave us the reactions of Charlie and Renee to Bella and Edward's news and through Bella's memories we see how Charlie reacted when Bella and Edward told him of their plans.  Unexpectedly, we see a friendship has formed between Esme and Renee amidst all the planning and Seth and Edward have remained friendly.  <br /><br />We also get a bit of information about what Jacob has been up to since receiving Edward's invitation at the end of Eclipse.  For Jacob fans this might be upsetting.  There is enough vagueness to make one think Jacob will have a pivotal role in the fourth book in the series and the last book from Bella's perspective.  <br /><br />It is disappointing that the publisher won't allow the author to post these chapters to her website which is seemingly related to them trying to get teenagers and adults to purchase Eclipse a second time.  This marketing ploy is a tad upsetting.  These books have sold very well on the first round and to try and get people to buy the book a second time because "we" are obsessed with these characters is a bit over the top and it appears a bit unethical.  Actually, the behavior of the publishing company is a bit predatory.  Personally, I went to the book store and read the chapters there and I recommend you all do the same.  Breaking Dawn will be out soon enough and why pay for the first chapter twice and Eclipse twice?  <br /><br />I work hard to earn my money, don't you?<br />

Melts in your mouth
Reading the third installment in the Twilight series was as satisfying to me as munching through a bag of dark chocolate M&Ms.  The big ones.<br /><br />Because, after all, Eclipse is BIG--629 pages--and in this volume of the story about Bella Swan, a mortal teenager, and vampire Edward Cullen, several big What If questions are explored:  What if Bella decides once-and-for-all to become a vampire like Edward; how can she possibly know when she's ready?  What if Edward relents and redraws his "many careful lines" for his physical relationship with Bella?  What would it look like if something so evil were to terrorize the Olympic Peninsula that Bella's good vampires and her werewolf friends had to try to unite to fight it, despite their ancient animosity?  And how would Bella's closest friend Jacob, probably the swiftest of the Quileute werewolves, compete with her supposedly true love Edward for her eternal devotion?<br /><br />Once again, Stephenie Meyer has written a compelling and often humorous sequel set in the lush environment surrounding the small town of Forks, Washington.  Her colorful characters feel like real people rather than types--a big thing for me.  And what situations could've been written morosely or indelicately came off instead as, well, as a kind of sensuous elegance.  Even though the more private moments of pain or pleasure were described honestly, with realistic detail, they weren't stripped of their intimacy by such telling.  That impressed me.  And there are lots of these kinds of moments throughout the book.  I just ate it up.<br /><br />One thing that might bog down readers is the tremendous amount of backstory that must be covered in order for the action and some characters' points of view to make sense.  It makes for a lot of exposition (as opposed to plain ol' action), even when the stories are coming out of the characters' mouths.   But at least the stories are told in varied styles, according to the characters relating them, so monotony is not an issue.  It's just a LOT of information to keep straight.<br /><br />Even so, unlike a bag of M&Ms, Eclipse did not give me a bellyache once I finished it.  It has left me wanting more.  And so I wait for book four...<br />

Became a fan after the movie...
I had heard about the fantasy books by a friend when they first came out but didn't have the time to look into them. By the time the movie came out, I'd nearly forgotten about the book referral, but asked my hubby to take me as it looked like a good vampire romance flick. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest forests, rivers, and coastline was breathtaking and as a native to this area, it was like going out into my own backyard which made the film that more appealing. I was so captivated by the actors portrayal of the characters (the facial expressions and emotions brought out of the characters by Rob, Kristen, Peter, Nikki, and the rest were mesmerizing) and the depth of the back-story left me desiring more! The very next day after viewing the movie in the theater - I raced to the bookstore to grab the first book. I was hooked, read through all four books (plus went to the authors website to read the extra materials she had posted there) in a week. Then, still not satisfied, went back and saw the movie several more times - IN THE THEATER, something I've never felt compelled to do before - because I was so drawn to the characters and the story. This may have been written for the young adult audience but I'm 32 and a parent of four children, and still found the story to be well worth my time. <br /><br />If you haven't read the stories, I encourage you to do so. Regardless, this film will be a treasured part of your movie collection and one you'll be sure to watch several times before you'll feel satisfied.

Obsessing over Twilight and can't wait for the DVD!!
I came into the Twilight series not expecting much. The books were, after all, marketed to the teen crowd, so I originally dismissed it.  I didn't expect much from the film.  I wanted to see it not for the story, but because I knew Robert Pattinson from "Harry Potter" and enjoy the vampire book/movie genre.  <br /><br />4 books and 7 viewings later, I am happy to report that I am now a happily obsessed "Twilighter."   <br /><br />Going into the movie, I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. As soon as the Cullen siblings walked through the cafeteria door, I knew I was in for the ride. And by the time Edward and Bella were sitting together at the restaurant in Port Angeles, I was smitten. The love story, the beautiful vampires, and the amazing chemistry between leads Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, made this film - for me - utterly irresistible. I knew I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over, and the female relatives that I went to see it with couldn't agree more.<br /><br />7 viewings later, I am still obsessed.  Like "Titanic" and all the wonderful Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell tv/movie adaptations before it, I was enthralled by the love story of Edward and Bella. Edward Cullen, a 108 year old vampire trapped in the body of a 17 year old, falls in love for the first time...to a human - a young unsuspecting girl named Isabella Swan.  Bella becomes equally fascinated by Edward, and this mutual fascination soon grows into yearning and love.  Theirs is a Romeo & Juliet like love story but this time it's not a family feud that keeps them apart, but the fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella is a human - the predator and the prey fall in love (or as Edward puts it, "...and so the lion falls in love with the lamb").  Within the story are some other conflicts, as Edward and his family's true nature must remain a secret, and as other vampires threaten Bella's life.<br /><br />Author Stephenie Meyer has crafted an irresistible tale, and screenwriter Rosenberg Melissa Rosenberg does a fine job of staying faithful with the novel. Some scenes and plotlines are changed around or omitted in order to make it work on film, but the essentials are there.  Director Catherine Hardwicke does a superb job of bringing all the elements together and guiding her young cast through the journey, so I was saddened to hear that she will not be helming the sequel.<br /><br />The major breakthroughs in this film, however, are the young and talented leads - Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. What started out as a small independent film has now become a worldwide phenomenon and has catapulted Rob and Kristen to the brink of superstardom.  And this is no accident.  The charismatic and versatile Robert Pattinson is brilliant as Edward. He properly conveys the internal conflict that rages within Edward and brings it out in full force.  When he's onscreen, you couldn't take your eyes off him.  His Edward can be gentle, loving and tender, but also fearsome and dangerous.  Kristen Stewart brings a beautiful and nuanced performance.  She is exactly how I pictured Bella and she does an excellent job of bringing the character to life.  The supporting cast is also wonderful.  Of the supporting roles, Billy Burke (Charlie Swan), Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen), Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) are standouts. I think everyone - with the exception of Nikki Reed's Rosalie Hale/Cullen (who I feel just doesn`t fit Rosalie physically) - are perfectly cast.<br /><br />I am also a fan of the soundtrack and Carter Burwell's amazing score, and I highly recommend purchasing these as a companion to the dvd.  I am thrilled that the dvd is finally coming, and I although the final specs are not yet available, I hope that Summit Entertainment will release a dvd version filled with extras, deleted/extended scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.  I'm a huge fan of the books and I feel that the cast and crew of Twilight has done an amazing job of bringing one of my favorite books to life.  I'm looking forward to New Moon, and I hope that it will be as good as, if not better than, the first film.  This film is a gem and one of my favorite love stories ever. Bella and Edward has joined the ranks of Elizabeth and Darcy, John Thornton and Margaret Hale, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, Cathy and Heathcliff,  Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater, and yes Romeo and Juliet, as two of my very favorite romantic couples that has ever graced the big and small screen.<br />

Enjoy The Movie For What It Is..
Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helps understand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I've seen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. But hey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wide age range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job and can't wait for New Moon.

Absolutely Amazing
This movie created a whole new obession that started with the books in the twilight series. It started with my 14 year old "teen" son saying I had to get a book for him. Well, that was a few weeks before the movie was released. As word traveled and the buzz about the upcoming movie approached. I read his book. I made it to the movie a few days after it was out. I loved it. But did not expect to see it again until it came out on DVD. Then I read the rest of the books in the twilight series. And somehow I was drawn back to the movie a week later. I felt like I was in Bella's head and needed to see the flick again. I left with more appreciation than the first time. I started to think more about the film and books. The love story alone makes you want more. When Edward says to Bella,"You don't know how long I have waited for you" your heart skips a beat and your body goes numb. I got the movie companion at a local store. I was surprised at the low budget. I also started to see "why" the director did what she did in the movie. Why the vampire's running or tree climbing wasn't the special effects we are used to in this day in age. I started to fall in love with the essence of the movie for what it really is. I am in a trance every time I see it. I am addicted to the characters, story line and every possible crumb of the twilight world. I have seen the movie for the 10th time tonight. Every time I see it, I am still amazed at the way Catherine has brought it to light. Yes, somethings are left out from the book. Yes, scenes are different than described in the book. However, the script has word for word from the book thoughout here and there. To take a book and make a movie on a limited time and budget, and capture the audience is a tall order. To deliver a movie that has already been perfected in a reader's mind is even more difficult. The movie follows the story line smoothly and is one of the best book to movie adaptions I have seen in a long time. I believe that Robert's acting was spellbinding. He is Edward Cullen. I am amazed how he embraced and captured the character of a 100 something year old vampire so realisticaly for a 22 year old young actor. His facial expression's alone express the emotion's that Edward has for Bella. You leave the theatre wanting more! To see the movie without reading the books may leave you with a limited vision of what is behind the story.But over all you should love the movie no matter what. The movie is my favorite and I am now a very twilight-addicted married mom of 3 boys.

Lovely, incandescent, sensual and captivating!
An unusual and lovely teen, Bella, reluctantly moves to live with her father in the misty, verdant forests of Washington State. Her first day of school goes well due to friendly classmates but then she encounters a young man, Edward, who glares at her with feral scorn--his black eyes sparkle with offense when she is near. She determines to confront his rudeness. But the next time she sees him he is oddly courteous and sincere. As they get to know one another Bella discovers that Edward has super strength and can even read minds. But when she is shocked by the icy cold of his hand she knows the truth. He is a vampire.  <br /><br />Edward's mystery, beauty and old-fashioned manners are irresistible to Bella. He makes a chivalrous attempt to stay away from Bella to protect her from the vampire world, but it is too late for both of them because are deeply in love. Bella and Edward have a forbidden love. They belong to warring families. Like Romeo and Juliet their passion is intensified by transgression against norms of their heritage.  Bella is relieved to learn that the family of vampires Edward is a part of is unusual; they are "vegetarian" vampires, meaning they only drink the blood of animals. <br /><br />Edward and Bella spend idyllic hours romancing in the mossy green redwood forests. Physical touching is almost impossible because Edward must continually fight against his fierce instinct to drink her human blood. But their hearts touch through their eyes. Edward's tender yet ardent courtship of Bella is poignant and tantalizing. Then Bella is threatened by becoming the target of a rogue predatory vampire. This predatory vampire is tantalized by the challenge of a battle of wits and skill against Edward and his family, who unite to protect Bella. <br /><br />Meyer's brilliant Twilight series introduced a fresh new vampire world into the genre. And in the movie the freshness continues. Filmed in gorgeous redwood forests, it is startling to see vampires in the sunlit meadows yet seeing them in light does not make them less mysterious or menacing. The young actors in this film are well cast; beautiful but unusual. Their characters are not shallow teens; these are complex young adults that care deeply about their lives, friends and family. Bella, played with intensity and verisimilitude by lovely Kristen Stewart, is a worthy and courageous hero who does not hesitate to put her own life in danger to protect her mother and her father. Despite the fact that she is just a frail human she fights back against supernatural and human predators. Edward is equally interesting as he is physically seventeen but is much older in years. Yet Bella is his first love and he is terribly concerned that he will cause her harm. Oddly handsome Robert Pattinson plays Edward with magnetism and aching vulnerability.  Kudos to the rest of the actors, particularly kind-faced Peter Facinelli as Carlyle, sensitive Billy Burke as Bella's father, captivating Justin Chon as Erik Yorkie, piquant Christian Serratos as Angela Weber, striking Gil Birmingham as Billy Black--I could go on and on the casting was excellent.  <br /><br />Brilliant director Catherine Hardwicke matched the beauty of the ancient forests with the emotional tone of the scenes with authority and confidence. Though I have not seen this director's other films I look forward to seeing her work. <br /><br />Twilight the movie has had to make choices to adapt Meyer's huge novel to the screen yet no sacrifice of quality has been made. The movie sensitively portrays the thoughtful and passionate characters created by Meyer while it enthralls and entertains with its contemplative beauty. Vampires symbolize the primal drives in all of us but in Twilight we are introduced to vampires who choose to put aside these urgent desires to avoid harm. Tender love and care are portrayed as the greatest power of them all. <br /><br />Seen it twice and can't wait to see it again.  An enthusiastic five stars--Twilight deserves to be a smash hit!

Amazon critic WAY off base
I just want to complain about the person who wrote the description/critique for Amazon. The person is so biased and ignorant of the allure of these books - this Twilight phenomenon. They aren't qualified to be writing the description. Of course they can dislike Twilight and its sequels if they choose -- but why in the world would they be chosen to write the blurb on the page where it sells? I'm not a kid -- no where NEAR that age -- and these books are as compelling to me as they are to my young daughter. There was humor in the movie for sure but certainly nothing "not" intentional. And to say the Edward Cullen role/actor is a simpering puppyish flaw played by Robert Pattinson: that's downright unbelievable. The writers mentality would surely have found the same silliness in the brooding angst of James Dean. It's no accident that Pattinson has become a world-wide star because of Twilight. He sizzles.   I just think reviews for a best selling book should be written by people who understand what they're reading.

Loosely based on the book, awesome in its own way...
I am a a huge fan (okay more like obsessed) of the Twilight Saga.  So I was so excited to see this on the big screen.  At first view, I was a little disappointed because its not like the book in many ways.  I liked it, but I sat in the theater and verbalized my frustration with the differences while watching.  After seeing it a second time, I decided I love Twilight the movie in a different way than I love the book.  It kind of makes it a whole other way for me to love Twilight.  I am so excited for New Moon and Eclipse to come out, and hopefully Breaking Dawn will soon follow as well on the big screen.  I totally recommend this movie, but you need to read the books to get the whole picture because the books are amazing.  This movie is loosely based on the book in my opinion, and does not do the book justice, but again, if you look at it as a different rendition of the book, its fantastic.  They were spot on with the casting as well.  Kudos on that factor!  All in all, great book, great movie, but not a great movie if you are looking for it to be just like the experience the book gives you.  Its a different experience entirely and I love both entirely.

Editorial Review of the Editorial Review
I'd like to give an editorial review of the Amazon Editorial Review.  Ouch!  Could you be more negative and condescending towards Twilight fans in your "Review" of the movie, "Twilight?"  What is up with that?  Geez!  May I suggest that you review the movie, not the caliber of people YOU think are "stupid" enough to enjoy it?  (ie. "...teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment.")  How insulting, and it reveals you know nothing of the character who is Edward Cullen, nor much about teens.<br /><br />BTW, the movie is awesome, and Robert Pattinson does a GREAT job throughout.

Leave the complaints about problems elsewhere and review the movie
This movie was epic. When you get a little older..of which I am 30 you think that movies made for a younger generation won't affect you. I was not expecting much from this movie but received alot. Even though I understood the premise there was so much more. The acting in this movie was superb and there are so many layers to the emotions being conveyed that it will take more than one viewing to get them. This movie was amazing and I would recommend to anyone.

The Hero In Romance is Everything--Behold Pattinson's Edward
I did not expect to like this movie.  For one, I think vampire love stories have been overdone to death.  Coppola's DRACULA, starring Gary Oldman, is one of my all time favorite movies and I really didn't need any pretenders to that throne.  This was before I saw Edward as played by actor Robert Pattinson.  In a nutshell, anyone who was ever a teenage girl will instantly grasp the appeal of this movie.  There you are leading the typical angst ridden teenage life when in walks this gorgeous supernatural being who is totally in love with you.  He lifts you out of your ordinary existence into an extraordinary one.  He woos you in extraordinary ways too, even flying you around your Pacific Northwest territory and watching you sleep with adoration on his face.  He never sleeps, of course.  I would be surprised if men liked this movie.  I think a guy would only watch it if his girlfriend insisted. He also has the considerable after viewing problem of measuring up to Edward/Pattinson, which will be pretty depressing.  The special effects are nicely done.  The female lead does a good job.  The plot is good vampires vs bad vampires, aside from the love story that is.  Absolutely no one would watch this movie though without  Edward/Pattinson.  I saw a recent poll on VANITY FAIR about the sexiest, most beautiful man in movies today.  Robert Pattinson just routed every other man of any age in movies today in that poll.  Everyone voted for him.  Since every woman was once a teenage girl, that is all you need to be to fall in love with this movie.  The last time I saw a video which had this kind of effect was when Colin Firth played Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  I am absolutely unsurprised TWILIGHT was directed by a woman, Catherine Hardwicke.  Being a woman who was once a teenage girl, I am sure she knew exactly how to proceed with this material.  I am tempted to give this less than 5 stars because I am rather ashamed I liked it this much.  It is a big guilty pleasure movie for me.  However, I then think, "Hey, I'm not a movie critic.  I can really, really enjoy something without being all torn up over artistic merit."  So the five stars stays.  We all need our guilty pleasures.<br />

Can't even wait to finish the book to write a review
I just received my book in the mail two days ago and I have been devouring it ever since. <br /><br />The book begins with seeing Bella become very comfortable with Edward and his family. I was delighted to see Alice's character take on more depth as we began to see more of her personality, but this may quickly turn into disappointment for some, when she is whisked away all too soon. Bella is given a birthday party and accidentally gets a paper cut. This leads to a tense moment when one of the family members cannot contain themselves and makes a leap for Bella. Edward is forced to protect her, but this makes it all to clear that keeping Bella close to the family puts her at risk. Edward begins to withdraw himself emotionally in order to (we readers know what is going to happen, but Bella seems to be in denial)leave her. <br /><br />Naturally, Bella's grief is heartwrenching to read. Any girl who has felt the pain of lost or unrequited love will shed a few tears during this chapter. It is hard to get over being furious at Edward's behavior at the begining of the book, but this simply shows you how easy it is to get pulled into almost believing these characters are real. <br /><br />Bella becomes seriously withdrawn from the world after his departure and considering their strange and magical relationship, this is to be expected. I do miss Edward's presence-he was such a strong character in Twilight- but I did something I never do, I flipped to the back of the book to assure myself of his return. Ms. Meyer realizes how addicted her audience is to Edward, so he does make token appearances in a roundabout way. Bella begins to hear Edward's voice warning her when she puts herself in harm's way and in this way Bella begins to court danger.<br /><br />Jacob, the young native American from Twilight, makes a reappearance in New Moon. He becomes a very close friend of Bella's and helps her through her depression. His character takes the place of Edward and he becomes a major player in this story. He is also the complete opposite of Edward's sophisticated, wordly one. Jacob is lovable, akward, attractive (in a regular way) and warm-blooded. His story is one of interest and I don't believe any reader who has already read Twilight, will be surprised at the turn of events in which Jacob is involved.<br /><br />The book is certainly excellent, as Ms. Meyer is a fabulous writer, but I do find myself impatiently turning the pages and skimming ahead to see when one of the Cullens' family members will appear. Even with those minor faults, I still find myself staying up way too late to finish another chapter. I have read half the book in the past two days instead of working on lesson plans for my class, during the first week of school, no less. This is a real indicator of just how wonderful New Moon is.<br /><br />My ultimate disappointment will be when I am finished and must wait another year for the next book to come out. I don't believe Stephenie Meyer can whip these out fast enough to appease her growing leagues of fans. This is a very desirable position to be in for a writer and this should guarantee many Bella and Edward stories in the future.<br /><br />*Update<br />The ending was very good and the reader finds out some interesting information concerning Bella and how special she really is. The twist adds a new dimension to the novel it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger. There is no complete closure for a few important issues and obviously this leaves it wide open for the third novel in the series.

A brief review of New Moon AND Twilight, the first novel
So many of the reviews are more about the character's actions- I'd prefer to actually discuss the book.  My sister just started high school, she's 15 and she lent New Moon and the first book, Twilight to me.  Despite our age gap (I'm sixteen years older) I found them a very engaging and entertaining read.  I'm glad to share these with her and I'd suggest them to anyone who is staring at a younger, somewhat mysterious female relative wondering what to buy them for Christmas.<br /><br />The pacing is good.  The book is a quick, satisfying read.  My feeling is that the author works through scenes rather than writing in a linear fashion- and the scenes are fairly cinematic in their structure which I personally like.  She gets to the point in her stories and fits a lot of action and significant detail in without overwhelming you with a density of vision.  <br /><br />If you're concerned about the content, as in "Is this appropriate to give my neice/cousin's kid etc" you can be assured that the romantic tension captured here is through restraint rather than exploration.  Not too surprizingly this is highly seductive.  Several reviews seem disappointed by the character's actions and have given fewer stars.  However, I'd like to say that this book is clearly part of a larger work and we're seeing Bella at a certain point in her personal growth.  It is not a conclusion novel so it doesn't feel like one.  She acts like, well, a confused person in love.  I think the depiction is honest and it is a good thing when a character can annoy or drive you crazy: it means you're engaged and the author has done their job well.<br /><br />I'll be honest- I wasn't expecting to be drawn in, now I'm a bit annoyed I have to wait until next fall.  <br /><br />New Moon is the sequel to Twilight, so I'm covering both in my review.  I think it could stand alone but I'd stronly recommend reading Twilight first as it really gives the foundations and 'rules' of Bella's world.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Pure Brilliance!
This sequel to Twilight, though not exactly what most readers expected, exceeded those expectations with an amazingly unpredictable story line- complete with the familiar characters we love so much!<br /><br />It starts out just a few months from where Twilight left off- Bella Swan is in true love with Edward Cullen, and his family of fellow friendly vampires. But then... a papercut at her birthday party leads the vampires to have a sudden urge to feed- only on her! In the days following the accident, none of her night dwelling friends are the same- not even Edward- phased and embaressed by their actions. But Bella doesn't expect Edward to break up with her and the Cullens to leave!<br /><br />Bella is left in a numb, zombie-like state for months, until she begins to wake from her dream state in January. She discovers that if she takes a few risks, takes just a little step out of line, she is able to hear the warning voice of Edward in her mind! Thrilled at the chance to hear his voice- even if she might be going crazy-, Bella begins to pursue the reckless behavior he made her promise to keep away from.<br /><br />Let's just say that Bella soon has her hands full. She renews her old friendships- including that with Jacob Black. Rumors of werewolves and vengeful vampiresses are circulating full throttle- and to top it off, she has the challenge of her own mind; forgetting and saving the Cullens at the same time.<br /><br />I refuse to delve an inch further into the plot- to spoil its wonderful tactics would be a sin! <br /><br />This book is just as amazing as its predecessor- if not more of a thrill ride. At first I thought its lack of romantic outlook between Edward and Bella would be a complete downcast- but I found myself, as I'm sure all readers will, being so drawn into Bella's emotions and struggles that it made not a difference to the book's loveability.<br /><br />The only thing I have to note to the negativity of the book is that the next installment could not possibly come out quickly enough to do justice to this story's complex ending! Just as everything ties together, it also leaves the reader hanging for the the future! I also wish that we could have been further introduced as to the ways and habits of new characters we are shown- to further understand their motives to come. Well, at least it goes without saying that there will be enough future plot to fuel the oncoming stories quite generously!<br /><br />Stephanie Meyer's words draw you so into the story; you feel as though it is your heart being completely broken and later completely refilled, just as it is Bella's! Her descriptions and portrayals of human emotion through Bella and the other characters can at times be ardent enough to bring tears to the reader's eyes! Literally!<br /><br />You want to continue reading so fast, that rarely would you feel any pacing problems a bit! Though quite a large book in length, it fills up the time passing throughout the story impeccably well! I cannot sing enough praise for New Moon!<br /><br />For all of those that have read Twilight, and have not yet picked up New Moon for fear of 'sequel disappointment', have no worries!  Even those who are not particularly fond of vampire stories, as myself, will enjoy New Moon and its prequel of Twilight to no end! What else to say other than that the story of Bella and the Cullens is pure brilliance?

Became a fan after the movie...
I had heard about the fantasy books by a friend when they first came out but didn't have the time to look into them. By the time the movie came out, I'd nearly forgotten about the book referral, but asked my hubby to take me as it looked like a good vampire romance flick. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest forests, rivers, and coastline was breathtaking and as a native to this area, it was like going out into my own backyard which made the film that more appealing. I was so captivated by the actors portrayal of the characters (the facial expressions and emotions brought out of the characters by Rob, Kristen, Peter, Nikki, and the rest were mesmerizing) and the depth of the back-story left me desiring more! The very next day after viewing the movie in the theater - I raced to the bookstore to grab the first book. I was hooked, read through all four books (plus went to the authors website to read the extra materials she had posted there) in a week. Then, still not satisfied, went back and saw the movie several more times - IN THE THEATER, something I've never felt compelled to do before - because I was so drawn to the characters and the story. This may have been written for the young adult audience but I'm 32 and a parent of four children, and still found the story to be well worth my time. <br /><br />If you haven't read the stories, I encourage you to do so. Regardless, this film will be a treasured part of your movie collection and one you'll be sure to watch several times before you'll feel satisfied.

Obsessing over Twilight and can't wait for the DVD!!
I came into the Twilight series not expecting much. The books were, after all, marketed to the teen crowd, so I originally dismissed it.  I didn't expect much from the film.  I wanted to see it not for the story, but because I knew Robert Pattinson from "Harry Potter" and enjoy the vampire book/movie genre.  <br /><br />4 books and 7 viewings later, I am happy to report that I am now a happily obsessed "Twilighter."   <br /><br />Going into the movie, I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. As soon as the Cullen siblings walked through the cafeteria door, I knew I was in for the ride. And by the time Edward and Bella were sitting together at the restaurant in Port Angeles, I was smitten. The love story, the beautiful vampires, and the amazing chemistry between leads Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, made this film - for me - utterly irresistible. I knew I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over, and the female relatives that I went to see it with couldn't agree more.<br /><br />7 viewings later, I am still obsessed.  Like "Titanic" and all the wonderful Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell tv/movie adaptations before it, I was enthralled by the love story of Edward and Bella. Edward Cullen, a 108 year old vampire trapped in the body of a 17 year old, falls in love for the first time...to a human - a young unsuspecting girl named Isabella Swan.  Bella becomes equally fascinated by Edward, and this mutual fascination soon grows into yearning and love.  Theirs is a Romeo & Juliet like love story but this time it's not a family feud that keeps them apart, but the fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella is a human - the predator and the prey fall in love (or as Edward puts it, "...and so the lion falls in love with the lamb").  Within the story are some other conflicts, as Edward and his family's true nature must remain a secret, and as other vampires threaten Bella's life.<br /><br />Author Stephenie Meyer has crafted an irresistible tale, and screenwriter Rosenberg Melissa Rosenberg does a fine job of staying faithful with the novel. Some scenes and plotlines are changed around or omitted in order to make it work on film, but the essentials are there.  Director Catherine Hardwicke does a superb job of bringing all the elements together and guiding her young cast through the journey, so I was saddened to hear that she will not be helming the sequel.<br /><br />The major breakthroughs in this film, however, are the young and talented leads - Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. What started out as a small independent film has now become a worldwide phenomenon and has catapulted Rob and Kristen to the brink of superstardom.  And this is no accident.  The charismatic and versatile Robert Pattinson is brilliant as Edward. He properly conveys the internal conflict that rages within Edward and brings it out in full force.  When he's onscreen, you couldn't take your eyes off him.  His Edward can be gentle, loving and tender, but also fearsome and dangerous.  Kristen Stewart brings a beautiful and nuanced performance.  She is exactly how I pictured Bella and she does an excellent job of bringing the character to life.  The supporting cast is also wonderful.  Of the supporting roles, Billy Burke (Charlie Swan), Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen), Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) are standouts. I think everyone - with the exception of Nikki Reed's Rosalie Hale/Cullen (who I feel just doesn`t fit Rosalie physically) - are perfectly cast.<br /><br />I am also a fan of the soundtrack and Carter Burwell's amazing score, and I highly recommend purchasing these as a companion to the dvd.  I am thrilled that the dvd is finally coming, and I although the final specs are not yet available, I hope that Summit Entertainment will release a dvd version filled with extras, deleted/extended scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.  I'm a huge fan of the books and I feel that the cast and crew of Twilight has done an amazing job of bringing one of my favorite books to life.  I'm looking forward to New Moon, and I hope that it will be as good as, if not better than, the first film.  This film is a gem and one of my favorite love stories ever. Bella and Edward has joined the ranks of Elizabeth and Darcy, John Thornton and Margaret Hale, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, Cathy and Heathcliff,  Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater, and yes Romeo and Juliet, as two of my very favorite romantic couples that has ever graced the big and small screen.<br />

Physical touching is almost impossible because Edward must continually fight against his fierce instinct to drink her human blood. But their hearts touch through their eyes. Edward's tender yet ardent courtship of Bella is poignant and tantalizing. Then Bella is threatened by becoming the target of a rogue predatory vampire. This predatory vampire is tantalized by the challenge of a battle of wits and skill against Edward and his family, who unite to protect Bella. <br /><br />Meyer's brilliant Twilight series introduced a fresh new vampire world into the genre. And in the movie the freshness continues. Filmed in gorgeous redwood forests, it is startling to see vampires in the sunlit meadows yet seeing them in light does not make them less mysterious or menacing. The young actors in this film are well cast; beautiful but unusual. Their characters are not shallow teens; these are complex young adults that care deeply about their lives, friends and family. Bella, played with intensity and verisimilitude by lovely Kristen Stewart, is a worthy and courageous hero who does not hesitate to put her own life in danger to protect her mother and her father. Despite the fact that she is just a frail human she fights back against supernatural and human predators. Edward is equally interesting as he is physically seventeen but is much older in years. Yet Bella is his first love and he is terribly concerned that he will cause her harm. Oddly handsome Robert Pattinson plays Edward with magnetism and aching vulnerability.  Kudos to the rest of the actors, particularly kind-faced Peter Facinelli as Carlyle, sensitive Billy Burke as Bella's father, captivating Justin Chon as Erik Yorkie, piquant Christian Serratos as Angela Weber, striking Gil Birmingham as Billy Black--I could go on and on the casting was excellent.  <br /><br />Brilliant director Catherine Hardwicke matched the beauty of the ancient forests with the emotional tone of the scenes with authority and confidence. Though I have not seen this director's other films I look forward to seeing her work. <br /><br />Twilight the movie has had to make choices to adapt Meyer's huge novel to the screen yet no sacrifice of quality has been made. The movie sensitively portrays the thoughtful and passionate characters created by Meyer while it enthralls and entertains with its contemplative beauty. Vampires symbolize the primal drives in all of us but in Twilight we are introduced to vampires who choose to put aside these urgent desires to avoid harm. Tender love and care are portrayed as the greatest power of them all. <br /><br />Seen it twice and can't wait to see it again.  An enthusiastic five stars--Twilight deserves to be a smash hit!

Amazon critic WAY off base
I just want to complain about the person who wrote the description/critique for Amazon. The person is so biased and ignorant of the allure of these books - this Twilight phenomenon. They aren't qualified to be writing the description. Of course they can dislike Twilight and its sequels if they choose -- but why in the world would they be chosen to write the blurb on the page where it sells? I'm not a kid -- no where NEAR that age -- and these books are as compelling to me as they are to my young daughter. There was humor in the movie for sure but certainly nothing "not" intentional. And to say the Edward Cullen role/actor is a simpering puppyish flaw played by Robert Pattinson: that's downright unbelievable. The writers mentality would surely have found the same silliness in the brooding angst of James Dean. It's no accident that Pattinson has become a world-wide star because of Twilight. He sizzles.   I just think reviews for a best selling book should be written by people who understand what they're reading.

Loosely based on the book, awesome in its own way...
I am a a huge fan (okay more like obsessed) of the Twilight Saga.  So I was so excited to see this on the big screen.  At first view, I was a little disappointed because its not like the book in many ways.  I liked it, but I sat in the theater and verbalized my frustration with the differences while watching.  After seeing it a second time, I decided I love Twilight the movie in a different way than I love the book.  It kind of makes it a whole other way for me to love Twilight.  I am so excited for New Moon and Eclipse to come out, and hopefully Breaking Dawn will soon follow as well on the big screen.  I totally recommend this movie, but you need to read the books to get the whole picture because the books are amazing.  This movie is loosely based on the book in my opinion, and does not do the book justice, but again, if you look at it as a different rendition of the book, its fantastic.  They were spot on with the casting as well.  Kudos on that factor!  All in all, great book, great movie, but not a great movie if you are looking for it to be just like the experience the book gives you.  Its a different experience entirely and I love both entirely.

Editorial Review of the Editorial Review
I'd like to give an editorial review of the Amazon Editorial Review.  Ouch!  Could you be more negative and condescending towards Twilight fans in your "Review" of the movie, "Twilight?"  What is up with that?  Geez!  May I suggest that you review the movie, not the caliber of people YOU think are "stupid" enough to enjoy it?  (ie. "...teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment.")  How insulting, and it reveals you know nothing of the character who is Edward Cullen, nor much about teens.<br /><br />BTW, the movie is awesome, and Robert Pattinson does a GREAT job throughout.

Leave the complaints about problems elsewhere and review the movie
This movie was epic. When you get a little older..of which I am 30 you think that movies made for a younger generation won't affect you. I was not expecting much from this movie but received alot. Even though I understood the premise there was so much more. The acting in this movie was superb and there are so many layers to the emotions being conveyed that it will take more than one viewing to get them. This movie was amazing and I would recommend to anyone.

The Hero In Romance is Everything--Behold Pattinson's Edward
I did not expect to like this movie.  For one, I think vampire love stories have been overdone to death.  Coppola's DRACULA, starring Gary Oldman, is one of my all time favorite movies and I really didn't need any pretenders to that throne.  This was before I saw Edward as played by actor Robert Pattinson.  In a nutshell, anyone who was ever a teenage girl will instantly grasp the appeal of this movie.  There you are leading the typical angst ridden teenage life when in walks this gorgeous supernatural being who is totally in love with you.  He lifts you out of your ordinary existence into an extraordinary one.  He woos you in extraordinary ways too, even flying you around your Pacific Northwest territory and watching you sleep with adoration on his face.  He never sleeps, of course.  I would be surprised if men liked this movie.  I think a guy would only watch it if his girlfriend insisted. He also has the considerable after viewing problem of measuring up to Edward/Pattinson, which will be pretty depressing.  The special effects are nicely done.  The female lead does a good job.  The plot is good vampires vs bad vampires, aside from the love story that is.  Absolutely no one would watch this movie though without  Edward/Pattinson.  I saw a recent poll on VANITY FAIR about the sexiest, most beautiful man in movies today.  Robert Pattinson just routed every other man of any age in movies today in that poll.  Everyone voted for him.  Since every woman was once a teenage girl, that is all you need to be to fall in love with this movie.  The last time I saw a video which had this kind of effect was when Colin Firth played Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  I am absolutely unsurprised TWILIGHT was directed by a woman, Catherine Hardwicke.  Being a woman who was once a teenage girl, I am sure she knew exactly how to proceed with this material.  I am tempted to give this less than 5 stars because I am rather ashamed I liked it this much.  It is a big guilty pleasure movie for me.  However, I then think, "Hey, I'm not a movie critic.  I can really, really enjoy something without being all torn up over artistic merit."  So the five stars stays.  We all need our guilty pleasures.<br />

Awesome!
I bought this movie as my first Blu-ray movie after recently purchasing a new player since this is one of my favorite movies.  The blu-ray version of this movie is filled with things that are not noticable in the original version and it makes it that much more AMAZING to watch!  The colors are more vibrant and the textures add so much more to the movie than I ever would have though possible.  If you love this movie you should definitly purchase this DVD in blu-ray!  Worth every penny!

Restraint
My daughter made me go to this movie in the theatre.  As usual, she has very good taste.  I greatly enjoyed the film.  Because it is a movie about vampires, one might expect blood & gore.  However, except for the climactic action scene, there is very little carnage.  Instead, "Twilight" is a romance.  Kristen Stewart who played Jody Foster's daughter in "Panic Room" plays Bella Swan who comes to the overcast town in Washington to live with her father.  Robert Pattinson played Cedric Diggory in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Widescreen Edition) (Harry Potter 4)</a>.  In "Twilight," he's the leading romantic character Edward Cullen.  His struggle is internal as he finds himself falling in love with Bella, if he can just resist the urge to kill her.  The two fathers are also pivotal characters in the film.  Bella's dad Charlie is a local policeman.  Billy Burke who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4SMCW">Fracture (Widescreen Edition)</a> with Anthony Hopkins really gives a marvelous performance as the single dad who cares about his daughter, but is a bit awkward and unpracticed at being a father.  Edward's dad is Dr. Carlisle Cullen, a physician whose good looks and pale complexion give him an air of calm mystery.  Peter Facinelli who played Takmet in "The Scorpion King" plays the role sympathetically.  Also a standout is Jasper, the newest recruit to the family.  In his brief appearances, his desire to eat the humans is barely contained and looks like hostility.  Jackson Rathbone who will be in "The Last Airbender" turns in a minimalist performance that works with his good looks.  The villains in the piece are a trio of hungry vampires whose dinner leftovers are attributed as kills by animals.  Rachelle Lefevre who appeared on TV's "Charmed" plays Victoria, the fur-wearing wild woman of the group.  Kenyan-born actor Edi Gathegi plays Laurent, the most reasonable of the trio.  He played Dr. Jeffrey Cole on TV's "House."  Making a savage impression is Cam Gigandet as James, the tracker vampire who stalks Bella relentlessly like a cat wanting to play with its food.  Gigandet played the bully Ryan McCarthy in "Never Back Down" & uses similar aggression in this film.  I enjoyed "Twilight" because of the unrequited romance between Bella & Edward.  The kiss that takes forever to culminate throbs with emotion all the more because of its restraint.  I purchased the single disc version as a used copy and am glad to be able to pop it in the DVD player.  Enjoy!

Good movie, excellent photography
The movie is really good , but the photography is even better. The nature of Oregon (in the movie is Washington State) is beautiful. It is a vampire romance with a little bit of mystery. I have both version and  the blu-ray version is a lot better (the quality is really superior!).

Twilight DVD
I loved the books and I love the movie. It doesn't follow the books completely but to me it really enhanced the story. I've seen many movies with far bigger budgets and more big name stars that were far less watchable.  I enjoyed Kristen Stewart's and Rob Pattinson's Bella and Edward performances and the rest of the cast is great too. Even my husband who is not really a fan said it was more entertaining than he expected it to be. There are so many nonfans out there who love to get on their soapbox but its a good story with an interesting plot which, let me remind everyone, was written for teenage girls not the intellectual masses who love to gripe. I personally would rather watch this movie 17 times than to sleep through another Harry Potter.

Twilight
I have read the book and saw this movie and felt a little disappointing because a lot of the things in the book were not included. Yes, I do know that the movie can only be a couple of hours because people lose interest if too long, yet if you did not read the book it will be great. It is a romantic movie all the way even though there is some action at the end but it's not a lot or as much as a guy would like to. I would recommend it if you like romance.

Really Grew on Me...
To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I'm in my 20s...).<br /><br />I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward's story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn't care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can't expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about "major things" missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn't notice any major omissions.<br /><br />Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson's performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke's fault or Pattinson's acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie.<br /><br />The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it's a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn't existed.<br /><br />Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I'm hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed "Twilight" for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can't have (and despite Meyer's Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there.

Wow, what a bundle!
If you have been holding off on getting an XBox 360 this is a great opportunity. Both of the included games are must owns and would cost you at least $100 if you bought them separately.  Forza 3 is arguably better than the Gran Turismo series, I personally have a lot more fun with it. Halo ODST has all the multiplayer stuff from Halo 3 so the online content is really nice.  The system reliability problems have been resolved, though I would still buy the three year warranty through Amazon no matter what console you buy.<br /><br />I own a PS3 slim as well and both systems are great and both have great exclusive games so if you can you should own them both, but I would start with an XBox if you have neither. The only thing that disappoints me about the XBox is that built-in wireless should have been added a long time ago.  The wireless adapter is laughably overpriced but there are cheaper alternatives like using a PC with internet connection sharing or buying a TRENDnet TEW-647GA Ethernet Port Wireless Gaming Adapter.  Some people think that XBox Live should be free also, and it would be nice if it was but you can find it cheaper if you look around. I always get a 1 year card for $30.  For that price it is a bit better than PSN, which isn't as polished and organized as XBox Live.<br /><br />Other great games for 360 ...<br />Mass Effect 1 & 2 - These are must play RPGs<br />Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition (also on PS3 but it's very buggy, get it on XBox instead)<br />Fable 2<br />Gears of War 1 & 2<br />Halo Reach (coming later)<br />Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 - also on PC since Valve apparently hates Sony :-(<br />Viva Pinata<br /><br />Also since the XBox has been around longer you can find A LOT more budget priced games and cheap used games around.<br /><br />If you want to get a system now this is a great bundle, but if you are still on the fence about jumping into the HD generation I would wait. The rumored "valhalla" chipset should be coming this year, which will be the CPU and GPU on one die which will take up less space and will probably prompt Microsoft to make a XBox 360 "Slim" like Sony always does. If they do that it will really boost sales and no one will want the older bigger model anymore.

Amazing deal for an amazing console!
If you were on the fence about purchasing an Xbox 360, look no further. This deal is giving you access to two free full-priced amazing games along with your 120gb 360. Halo 3 : ODST comes with the ODST campaign of Halo 3 and a separate disk with Halo 3 multiplayer (meaning you don't need to buy the original Halo 3 to play online, both connect to each other. On that disk you also get the map packs available only on Xbox LIVE (Legendary, Mythic map pack, etc). Best of all, though, EVERY copy of ODST comes with beta access to Halo: Reach in May! Halo: Reach is looking to be the definitive Halo in terms of story, graphics, and multiplayer. If you know about video games, I'm sure you've seen some previews already; it's everywhere!<br /><br />Forza 3 is a superb racing sim. I've spend around 260~ hours on my file and I've only really completed around 25% of the game. I've spent hours in the auction house and storefront buying and reselling cars alone to raise my in-game credits, and, while I suck at designing and customization, people devote hundreds of hours making amazing graphic designs for your cars and selling them in the in-game online store. The racing is top-notch and unlike any racing sim you'll ever play. Try your hand at racing in career mode, win credits and build up/customize your garage or take your skills online in multiplayer. Your choice! (Even if you don't want these 2 free games, you can sell them on craigslist or eBay for a nice amount).<br /><br />Other superb Xbox 360 exclusives to look into are:<br /><br />Gears of War 1 & 2<br />Lost Odyssey<br />Viva Pinata<br />Perfect Dark<br />Fable II and III<br />Crackdown 1 & 2<br />Tales of Vesperia (US/EU)<br />Mass Effect 1 & 2<br />Splinter Cell: Conviction<br />Alan Wake<br />Metro 2033<br />Dead Rising<br />Left 4 Dead 1 & 2<br />Portal: Still Alive and Portal 2 (coming Fall 2010)<br />Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts <br />Banjo Kazooie and Banjo- Tooie (XBLA, remakes of the classic ones)<br />Halo Wars<br />Magna Carta 2<br />Shadow Complex<br /><br />Okay, enough with games! *phew* The console is a 65nm Jasper chip model and highly resistant to "3RROD" unlike the older 360 models. Studies put the rate at about 3%, or pretty much in line with your everyday household electronic. The 120GB coming with your console is practically needed if you're going to be serious about playing so many games. Downloading games onto your HDD results in no disk even spinning inside your console, which means an extremely quiet Xbox (even throughout 12 hour gaming sessions, trust me, I know) and hardly any heat emission from your Xbox.  <br /><br />All in all, if you're looking to purchase an Xbox 360, THIS is the bundle you want. With so many games released and being released, if you're on the fence for yourself or a relative, now's your chance to get with the bandwagon!<br /><br />

Patient One
I had been wanting an Xbox 360 for a while. Finally a bundle I could not pass up! Both games high up on my desire to play list, bundle that with the 120GB hard drive and make the console black, and I couldn't resist. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others who do not have an Xbox 360 or have a red ringed older model.

Great
This is a good xbox 360 starter set for 17 and older because it includes halo odst which is a rated M game. I think Microsoft did included these games to promote sales, Its a great deal, but i think it is a wrong move. Many parents will not allow their kids to play rated M games therefore, they will probably think twice before buying this bundle.Anyways, I don't really think this xbox 360 should have the title " elite ", because it doesn't include the hdmi, component or the audio cable in one big bundle like the 2008's bundle.The console is a jasper model (smaller gpu/cpu for better cooling)so its much cooler and quiet, it's also not really vulnerable to rrod anymore. <br /><br />xbox live is a little overprised but its not laggy, i recommend you to use a ethernet cable instead of the 70$ adapter if your router is close by. This set also includes a controller, but if you have a kid you MUST buy a second controller, it's very annoyig to hear kids complain and fighting over controllers.<br /><br />This also includes a 120 gb hardrive, which is huge. There is no need to buy a memory card because this might take a decade to fill up. Also, the xbox marketplace has alot of good demos, videos to download. The NXE dashboared is improved and easier to use and you can sign up for netflix if you have gold membership. If you have a hd tv its best to use a hdmi cable ,because the console can support resolutions of 1080p and support 5.1 dolby digital. <br /><br />I think its best if you use it horizontally because the xbox can have more air intake, but if you plan to use vertically than i think you should buy a cooling stand. This console is definetely a good buy:) <br />

Unboxing the XBOX Elite Spring Bundle

<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great Bundle.
Seeing as I needed a new Xbox the elite bundle seemed to be the best option as you get two free games. I lucked out and just happened to order a couple days after the Spring Version release. I'm glad I was able to get two good games instead of Lego Indian Jones and one good game. Two things I don't like about the package is a lack of HDMI or Component cables and Microsoft refusing to give out the transfer cables for free anymore. These are minor things however as anyone with an older 360 can still use the original video cables with the Elite. Overall a great purchase. A must buy for anyone wishing to buy or upgrade the Xbox 360.

A bundle of fun/savings
First off, the Xbox 360 has proven to be one of the finest console gaming experiences ever. The excellent roster of games, both upcoming and currently available, along with Microsoft's well-regulated and affordable online service, present a great base experience. In terms of the console's performance, the new Jasper chipset has cut down drastically on the console's propensity to overheat, and results in a quieter, more stable system with a smaller power brick.<br /><br />Xbox Live is a good enough service that I found myself unable to resist purchasing online DLC (downloadable content) for my favorite games. A larger hard drive is essential if you are into augmenting your games with post-release content (although it should be noted that, after you purchase the content, you can always re-download it if you need to delete it to free up space). This console offers a great opportunity for lots of storage, a new, dependable console chipset (my console, purchased a week ago, was manufactured in 2/2010), and two great games to boot.<br /><br />Halo 3: ODST has a fun, if short, campaign along with a hugely addicting single-player or co-op gametype called Firefight. It is well worth picking up if you have any liking for Halo at all.<br /><br />Forza 3 is a very high-quality hybrid racer, part sim, part arcade racer (I found it to lean more towards the simulation, but the game options are very flexible), with lots of cars, tracks and upgrade content. If you like racers, it has a lot to offer.<br /><br />When taken together, this console is a killer deal, essentially throwing in two of the most popular games of 2009 for free. You can't lose, especially if you need to replace an older, less reliable iteration of Microsoft's sometimes-problem-fraught console. If you're new to the Xbox 360, this is a fine way to get into the game, or more specifically, two of the best and most fun games available.

Currently the best Xbox bundle
The Elite Spring 2010 Bundle is currently the best value in an Xbox 360 console. Compared to the Arcade Spring 2010 Bundle, this has a headset, a one-month Netflix trial, a 120 GB hard drive, an ethernet cable, and two (better) games all for an extra $100. The Arcade Spring comes with two outdated, lame games, while this includes ODST and Forza 3 which are great titles that you will actually play and, from a $$ point of view, are worth considerably more. If you buy a 120 GB HD, that alone retails for $99.99, so everything else you can just consider free over the Arcade Spring Bundle. I probably sound like I only care about money, but this is a bundle package so I figure you should know you're getting, right?
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Fun for Everyone
This is a great deal on an awesome system. <br />The 2 included games are worth at least $100 plus you get the 120G hard drive, headset, wireless controler and one month xbox live included. All this for only $100 more than the arcade system.<br />While I mostly use it for playing games, my son loves streaming movies from Netflix and my wife uses Netflix and Facebook. There is something for everyone with this system. Having the ability to download free trials of games to see how I like them before buying them saves me from getting titles I will not enjoy and saves money.<br />With the new jasper chipset installed, there should be no more worries about having the system overheat and fail. I play for hours at a time and the unit does not get hot at all. Though this system was released first of the 3 new generation systems, it is equal to or better than it's competitors in many areas. The graphics are equal to the PS3 from what I can tell due to the ATI GPU and the IBM tricore, multithread Xenon CPU. The project Natal release in the fall will bring the motion sensing functionality similar to the Wii but without the need to use controllers.<br />The xbox 360 is a great family console.

Xbox 360 is awsome
Ok, I love this bundle, the games alone cost 120 dollars. This is great, I wanted to buy an Xbox 360 and I was kind of hesitant, this deal just pushed me over the edge. The best thing about Xbox 360 is the online multiplayer. I got hooked up with Gears of War 2 and I sold my older Xbox 360 due to over addiction. Now I am back in the game and I can't wait until I get my Xbox, it is arriving tomorrow. :)

x-box enjoyment
I would just like to say this X-box 360 is too much fun. It works just as advertised and the graphics are sweet. I recommend this to most people, you can't go wrong with this buy. It's the future of gaming I think.Try it out, you won't be sorry. Works great on a HDMI monitor(no matter a 23").

Great Bundle Value
What really sold me is you get the best gaming console bundled with games you will actually enjoy at a great price. The Xbox lives up to its name, and the elite model has all the latest upgrades from Microsoft. I really enjoy Forza 3 and the wireless controller is perfect.

Great Bundle
As a newbie, I asked my expert friend about this bundle. It turns out to be a perfect choice: must-have games for new players (which worth about $100!), large-enough hard drive, and most things you need to play. I bought it with the free $50 amazon gift card, which made it just better.<br />I want to remind you that a newbie may need something more besides this bundle: a play & charge kit (to go with the wireless controller) and a VGA HD AV cable for xbox 360 (if you are connecting it to a PC monitor instead of a TV like me). You may also want to buy xbox 360 live gold card. Everything can be purchased on Amazon, and generally cheaper than buying from anywhere else. <br />There was a "3 for 2" xbox game sale on Amazon and I bought Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, and Fable 2. I'm planning to buy Mass Effect 2 when the price is lower. Great games for me to start my 360 life :-)

Awesome Gaming Machine BUT The AV Cable Didn't Work For My HDTV!!!!!!!!!!!!
First of all I would like to thank Microsoft for coming up with such a great gaming machine at an excellent price! I just got my Xbox 360 Elite yesterday and I've been playing it all day today. However, I felt the need to comment on one major problem I had when I received my Xbox yesterday. After opening up the box and setting up the gaming machine on my television, I was initially unable to get the system to work. All that came up was a blank blue screen that said "AV 1". After a couple of stressful hours, I decided to call up the Xbox customer support phone number to see if they could come up with a solution. I spoke to the girl on the phone for about 20 minutes and she came to the conclusion that I had a bad AV cable. After taking down my information and registering my Xbox, she told me that I would receive a new AV cable in the mail in about 5-10 days. While I am a patient person in many cases, I was not a very patient person in this situation (come on man it's an Xbox 360 Elite!). I decided to go ahead and buy another cable at a local game shop rather than wait up to 10 days for another one. Instead of buying another standard AV cable, I decided to get the HD AV component cable since my big screen tv has a maximum resolution of 1080i which is a little outdated compared to the newer televisions. It also does not have an HDMI port. After installing the new cable I was very happy to find that it worked! At first I thought the Xbox customer support rep was right about the other cable being faulty. However, I wanted to compare the HD graphics to the standard ones which is why I tried hooking up just the three standard hookups on the HD cable (red, yellow and white). Surprisingly, the blank blue screen came up again which made me come to the conclusion that the problem wasn't the cable the entire time! <br /><br />The reason why I wanted to address this problem is because I don't know whether my problem is very unique or quite common. If it is a common problem, I'm sure many people have drawn the conclusion that their Xbox 360 was broken. If I hadn't purchased the new HD AV component cable, I probably would have done the same and would have sent the Xbox to Microsoft to get fixed. Hope this helps guys and just to let you know I highly recommend this Xbox system. If I'm correct this system has the latest chips which has solved any past problems with the Xbox. Thumbs up Microsoft!<br /><br />P.S. If you had the same problem as me please comment on this review.

Quieter, cooler and conquering the competition
A bit of history; I used to own a launch 360 a few years back. <br />It broke down 3 times within a year and a half before I decided to sell it. <br />But now that it has so many great games you can't find on any other system I decided to buy a new one.<br />The first thing I noticed is how considerably cooler this machine runs compared to my older model.<br />Hopefully this means it'll go a lot longer without giving me the red ring of death.<br />Installing games directly to the hard drive means you won't get any disk read errors.<br />You do need the game disk in the drive to play for security reasons but I don't hear it spinning. <br />The fans can be a little loud but as long as it keeps the system cool it's a necessary annoyance.<br />However, once you get into an intensive game you probably won't notice the fans at all. <br />Graphics wise the machine is a powerhouse. It's a hardcore gamer's favorite but the casual gamers have plenty of choices on this platform, too. And with the release of project Natal comming soon, those same hardcore, casual and younger gamers will have more ways to play new and innovative titles.<br />Freezing can be a minor issue. In the last week I've had two games freeze at random times. Saving often can help if this happens to you.<br />I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone looking for a solid console with plenty of great games to play.

Best Gaming System this Generation  Hands Down
WOW!!! This bundle is unbelievable.  Don't listen to the fanboys claiming the system in unreliable.  It was true 2-3 years ago but it is no longer the case.  The new Jasper chipset is much quieter, cooler running and reliable.  Even so, Microsoft still offers a 3 year warranty.  My ps3 got YLOD and died after a year and a half and sony tried to charge me 179$ to fix it.  What a rip-off!! <br /><br />But this review is mainly to talk about the quality games the xbox 360 has to offer that no other console can compete with.  XBOX 360 has over 319 games reviewed at 75 or above on metacritic.<br /><br />The ps3 has only 224 games over 75.<br />[...]<br /><br />It is pretty clear if you are a true gamer who wants the best gaming system this generation has to offer, the XBOX 360 is the way to go.  Xbox live is unparalleled, and the best online community for gaming.  Netflix, twitter, and facebook integration is seamless. Achievements, gamertags, avatars, and cross game chat are just icing on the cake that push the xbox 360 experience above beyond its competitors.<br /><br />There is a reason the xbox 360 continues to outsell the ps3 month after month in America.  Just last month February 2010, the xbox 360 outsold the Wii, moving 422,000 consoles. Don't get left behind, jump in today.  <br /><br />Simply put, XBOX 360 has the most games, and the highest rated games, period.<br /><br />GET THIS DEAL BEFORE IT'S GONE!!!<br /><br />

Finally pulled the trigger and upgraded to the new 360
And so far I'm glad I did.  I've been an original xbox owner for about 7 yrs now and ever since the new 360 platform was introduced I have researched and have waited patiently.  The first wave deterred me due to the problems of the overheating and the red ring disasters I read and heard about. Too many possible problems to dump $400+ on.  For a brief moment or two I even thought about going to the PS3 platform. However, being familiar with xbox and the slew of games I own I wanted to really wait for another release from Microsoft. So my original machine would have to do for a little while. I almost bought the Holiday 360 bundle since the reviews were more promising with the "Jasper" fix and the release of COD Modern Warfare2 had me getting closer to pulling the trigger on one.  But the fact that the 2 games included were lego batman and pure, I decided to wait once again. We also have a Wii with all those types of games like the lego batman for the kids that I wanted something for myself "Dad". Then last week I noticed [...] had this new Spring bundle with Forza 3 and the Halo 3 ODST paired with a $50 gift card so I added it to my cart and it was sitting there waiting for me to click on the purchase button. Once again though with the tax added the gift card was almost a wash. I walked away from the computer and thought I've been this patient I'll see what other retailers will do.  With me being an Amazon freak, I was blown away that the next day I saw that Amazon had the same deal.  But better! No tax, delivered to my door in 2 days with prime and I was set. I got the $50 Amazon gift card with the order, the Square trade 3 yr warranty (which was about $70 cheaper and 1 yr longer than the Best Buy warranty)was emailed within a few hours and 6 months financing with the Amazon card so I was happy. It was delivered Wednesday and I was off hooking it up and messing around with it like a gambler landing in Vegas for the first time! The hook up was obviously simple using the included composite cable and for now I am using an ethernet cable into my wireless router for the xbox live. Even though I have wireless here, the $80 wireless add on is not a necessity right now. One small gripe is the fact Microsoft can't include an HDMI cable or built in wireless but in the end it's all about money. So I included an HDMI cable with the same Amazon order for an extra $8, so not a huge deal. Comparing both hookups on my newer Samsung LCD HDTV it was a huge difference between the composite and HDMI. For less than $10, if you have HDMI, there's no reason not to hook it up that way. The included games are fantastic (they are not full versions of the games but that is stated up front)and the xbox live is sensational. With plenty of downloads and free demos to check out, it keeps one busy for a long time. The graphics are awesome and very realistic. With the xbox live update, I was playing some of my older games like Nascar 2003 that I really love and Star Wars Battlefront 2 and spongebob with my son. These older games worked perfect and was another reason I wanted to stick with Microsoft. These older games I have become addicted to are hard to let go of.  My Netflix account was up and ready in the blink of an eye and looked great with no loss of streaming. This machine runs pretty quiet, even compared to the old system and has not been getting really hot.  I haven't had it running non stop like the old one yet, but so far so good on the overheating issue. Still too early though. While I can't compare it to a Sony platform, I can say if you are like me and have waited to buy this machine, do it now and go ahead and take the leap. From what I have encountered so far, it is an outstanding machine and a ton of fun at a decent price.

GREATEST GAMING DEAL IN A LOOOONG TIME!!!
FIRST OF ALL THIS HAS THE NEW JASPER CHIP SO IT WONT RED RING YOU.  PLUS U GET A 120GB HARD DRIVE AND 2 GAMES!!  IM SORRY PS3 FANS BUT THIS SYSTEM IS BETTER FOR GAMING.  THE PS3 IS A MORE VERSATILE CONSOLE BUT THE GAMING PERFORMANCE ON THE XBOX IS FAR SUPERIOR.  I WOULD RECOMMEND BOTH IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY BUT IF YOU'RE MORE INTO GAMING THEN DEF. GET A XBOX

Ps3 can't compare, xbox bundle superb.
I traded in my xbox about a month ago due to hardware issues and bought a Ps3.<br />While the system is a lot quieter, has a blu-ray player, and allows you to browse the web, the gaming aspect is highly inferior to the 360. The online is horrible, and besides Uncharted and MLB the show, it can't compete as far as games. <br /><br />I picked up this bundle this weekend (traded my PS3) and needless to say I'm estatic. Two great exclusives to go along with good ole xbox live was a no brainer. Anyone who likes playing GREAT GAMES should not think twice about this system. Ps3 has simliar issues with their hardware if you do your research, so don't believe the hype that Sony has a perfect product. Don't be deceived, Xbox is better hands down.

Prepaid Is Better
To start off, I'd like to say that XBox Live is amazing and worth every penny. Online gaming is incredibly fun and a quite good way to pass time.<br /><br />That aside, there are downsides to XBox Live that can be avoided through prepaid cards. Number one, you always run the risk that unwarranted transactions will be made if your credit card information is stored on your XBox 360 system. It may not happen all that often, but it's best to avoid it all together.<br /><br />The biggest reason to buy prepaid Xbox Live card is the renewal process that happens when you don't use one. If you order XBox Live through your system, it'll renew everytime your subscription runs out. This wouldn't be a problem except that it's not that easy to cancel. Instead of cancelling through your system, you have to go through the hassle of actually calling XBox Live support. Even then, depending on the representative you get, you may be hassled to keep your subscription because they really don't want you to cancel it. I'm guessing that's part of their job to convince you to keep it, but it still is frustrating to the person that is trying to cancel it.<br /><br />You'll have to go through this process everytime you want to cancel if you don't use a prepaid card. Is that hassle really worth it? I don't think so. Therefore, avoid all of the problems by simply buying a prepaid card. You won't be sorry.

Best Deal you will ever find! ! !
This is the BEST deal I have ever found on the Xbox Live 12 Month Subscription.<br /><br />I looked 6-10 different places for a deal on this and only found 1 close to this and that was wal-fart but I dislike shopping there so Amazon was the place to go.<br /><br />This should be a guaranteed buy and you CAN'T beat the Price!!!

It is what it is
Find the card on sale every so often each year.  Don't pay the full price.  The Xbox Live Gold is stellar and I love it, but I don't see how they charge $50 or more a year and you don't get any freebies...other than advanced demo downloads.  They need to throw a bone for a free song or discounted DLC or a free rental every so often.  I have spent well over $1000 in my 3 years with the Xbox 360 on peripherals, games and downloads.  2% of my money spent as a  gift would have paid for 1600 points of DLC...that would be a nice thank you from Xbox 360 for keeping their community alive and well.

Nice deal!
My fiancee was under the $6 a month plan - this is a much better deal. We bought this card for $40, which is better than the $72 we WERE paying.<br /><br />Xbox Live really contributes to the gaming experience. The connection to Netflix is almost enough to get it RIGHT there. It helps us to maximize use of our Netflix subscription AND any games we buy (expansion releases).

Xbox 360 12 Month Live Gold Card
This is a good deal @ this price. Only once or twice a year will you see it lower, usually. I was pleased w/this purchase.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Get it for 35, if its higher than that you did not look hard enough.
Xbox Live is essential to playing your console and I would recommend it to any player, but don't go around dropping 50 dollars or more. The price can be found as low as 30 now so set some standards and do a little deal looking. The experience is worth paying, but don't pay more than you have to. <br /><br />Happy buying.

Ultimate Xbox Live Gold Card!
This is the best Xbox Live Gold card I have ever purchased.  When it arrived I knew that just looking at the packaging I was in for a world of awesome.  While rending open the package I suddenly noticed how great my muscles suddenly started looking.  Upon entering the code into my account I was then able to complete the most impossible achievement challenges gaining a quick 10,000 gamer points, also my really hot next door neighbor came over and became my girlfriend.  The next day I started to receive friend invites from celebrities including Ice T, Jimmy Fallon, and Carrot Top to name a few.  So if you are looking for an Xbox Live Gold Card this is the one to get!

Peace of Mind
Although this is not a game I gave it a five star rating.  Not just because it's cheaper than paying monthly directly from the company, but because of the peace of mind.  One day my son calls me at work frantic because someone had hacked his account and purchased points with the credit card I had on the account.  The matter was resolved and I was issued a refund but I would have been forever weary about using my credit card again.  This way I don't have to.  Oh, and it's CHEAPER!

A years worth of gaming.
Even though this is no video game...it does have something to do with gaming, this card gives you a years worth of online gaming, shopping and even video entertainment with the purchase of xbox points but thats another story, just be warned, there are several sites/stores that will try to sell this card for a ridiculous price so shop around for the best price, get online and get your game on because the world is waiting to team up with you or beat up on you.

Easy application, works instantly, gives a year's worth access to XBox Live (XBL).  It's great!

Simply more cost efficient here on Amazon...
Exactly what it says. A code for a 12 month subscription to Xbox Live. <br /><br />It is about $10 cheaper here at Amazon compared to stores like Gamestop, so I highly recommend picking it up here. Occasionally places such as WalMart will have the same deal, but that is only every so often.

Great for talking and playing with friends
XBox live is great if you want to message, chat with, or play games with friends.  Also if you need to d/l updates for your xbox360, like in order to play video files streaming from your computer on the network, etc.  There's just so much you can do with it.  The quality of Xbox Live is probably the main reason XBox does so well.

XBOX live 12 Months
This is a really good deal since it's 20% less than pretty much all other places you might buy the card. It's a huge savings compared to the 3 month subscription option $40.00 dollars per year vs. $60.00 dollars per year with the 3 month subscription. It's pretty self explanatory and I do recommend it.

Great Price!!! Had to buy
Better than buying it through Microsoft.  Bare with me: Don't - let me stress this - DON'T input your CC into your XBLA it will be a pain to remove.  <br /><br />I had to change the plastic and the CC number to disable the auto renewal feature. Then I called MS and I told them the card was not active any more, and believe it or not: they decided to keep it!<br /><br />Go Prepaid, it is very simple to input and does the trick for a better price.

Saving a lot of money!
My husband and I both have Xbox Live and it is a lot cheaper to buy this year-membership for $40/ea as opposed to paying $8.61/mo for both of us. Just to put it in perspective: I was paying about $200 a year but now I'm paying $80. I'm glad I finally wised up because this will save us a lot of money. If only I had realized this sooner!

xbox live at a discount
What more can you really ask for?  Xbox live for 12 months at a $10 discount.  Sure it would be nice if it were free but that probably won't happen.  One thing that would be great is if Amazon would just email the xbox live code to you rather than have to waste money/time shipping the actual card to you.  But otherwise it's a prepaid card to get xbox live cheaper.  You can use this to renew your current xbox live account, just punch in the codes into the membership section of your account and it auto renews it for another 12 months.

Now's a great time to grab a 360.
First of all, I'm a PS3 owner and have been nearly since it's launch. I really love the PS3 and think it's a great system. I had considered buying a 360 many times but kept passing over it after hearing of all the problems it had and just figured I didn't want to deal with the chances. Well after seeing this bundle with the new price cut and finding out this bundle is definitely the latest "Jasper" version I went ahead and purchased it. The two included games aren't exactly *amazing* but they're still pretty good and it's definitely a good deal to get both of them included for no added cost. <br /><br />So far I've noticed the system does seem to run a good bit cooler than my brothers original launch model 360. I'm also really enjoy the new menu system for the 360. Or maybe I should say newer, I'm not sure when it came out, but I prefer it over the older "tabbed" style menu previously used. Overall I believe now is a great time to grab a 360. Since it has been out longer than the PS3 you do have access to more titles and more titles that are cheap. Some of the systems best games can easily be picked up for $29.99 now. The ability to use Netflix on the system is also really amazing. The menu system and the integration to the Xbox menu is top notch, it definitely doesn't feel like an after thought. <br /><br /><br />Thus far my only gripe with the system is how Microsoft uses it's point system for purchasing items. I much prefer just buying a game for say $6.99 from the Playstation Network than more or less being forced to buy considerably more points than you need to be able to grab one game. For example, you want to purchase a game  that's 1200 points, guess what the smallest you can add is 1000 so you're then forced to jump up to 4000 points (which I believe equals twenty dollars) to be able to get the game. You're then left with odd point amounts  and it's really just a pain! It seems pretty deliberate to grab more money out of consumers.

Buy this and relax
I bought the 360 when it came out (stood in a long line and waited and waited to get it).<br /><br />I'm likely one of the few who never had a problem with his 360 (doesn't mean I wasn't paranoid), but I never had a problem.  I sold my launch console to grab the HDMI version (the falcon) and still wasn't that happy with it.<br /><br />It was hot, made lots of sound, and I was always paranoid thinking (this might be the last game I ever get to play, better rush it).<br /><br />It got so bad I started buying multi platform games for the ps3 (even though back then the ps3 version was inferior to the 360).  Only using the 360 for netflix and forza.<br /><br />That all changed when M$ came out with this model.  It fixes everything.<br /><br />No sound, (with this large harddrive, be sure to install all your games just to be "extra safe" my cousin's dvd drive has died twice (2 different consoles), and because of this I always recommend getting the bigger harddrive and installing (now that I have this elite, it's not a problem).<br /><br />This guy is quite, does not make the temperature rise in the house, and most important, I can just sit back and play xbox now without the worry and fear that previous consumed me.<br /><br />I will discuss xbox vs ps3 at the end before my final recommendation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Xbox 360 Elite Holiday - Comes with 2 games (both can be throwaways I did not buy this for those games and never played them, but hey, they are 2 games you get for free).<br /><br />Black Console (looks better in my room, black tv, black ps3, black tv stand, black speakers, black controller, may as well have a black console (got rid of my wii)).<br /><br />Big Harddrive (you can go crazy on the marketplace, downloading demos, getting xbl games, and installing the games you get from amazon to HD and ensure they don't get scratched or spin like crazy making your room hotter (and the box get loud).<br /><br />Quite (is this thing on?!)  No sound, no loud as all fan, just quite, not even near as hot fun 360 gaming.<br /><br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />My heat bill may go up this year.  Usually I just turn on my 360 and play call of duty, 30 minutes later you can take off your eskimo gear and put on your swimming trunks (even in 0 degree temperature) and still be hot.  NOT SO with the new elite ;(  Now when I play the temperature doesn't change!  So if you use this instead of buying a heater for your house, buy an older model off the amazon marketplace.<br /><br />Still no built in wifi (really?)<br /><br />Comes with stand AV cables (you know, the ones that come with the ARCADE!)<br /><br />Comes with 2 games you could care less about (last year's bundle wasn't much better either).<br /><br /><br />Xbox 360 VS PS3 (if you can choose only 1)<br /><br /><br />Xbox 360 PROs<br /><br />Better Multi Platform Games<br />Most of the time better graphics (except for first part ps3 exclusives)<br />Better live interface (the xbox dashboard being far superior to the ps3 dashboard)<br />Better Remote (Half True) It's IR (which stinks as you have to be in line of sight) but the lights glow in the dark (you win some you loose some).<br /><br />360 charge and play kit beats the free usb cable you get with the ps3 (it's just so small!)<br /><br /><br />Xbox 360 Cons<br /><br />Not as good of an exclusive lineup of games (let's be honest)<br />Hardware failure rate (that I'm about 90% sure this model fixes)<br />You have to pay to go online.<br />You have to pay for everything with the 360 (they pull you in with the "low" price, and then make you pay pay pay.  Want to play online?  50 a year, want wifi?  100, want HDMI cable, gimmie 60 and so on and so on (I would bring up the HD-DVD player, but that would be cruel, and yes I did buy that the day it came out!)<br /><br /><br />PS3 Pros<br /><br />Better exclusive games (to be honest, the 360 has far more games, but the ps3 exclusives are generally very good and anyone who enjoys games should play them).<br /><br />Cheaper (you may say they cost the same, but when you factor in what I wrote above (wifi, charge kit, xbox live service, and more) it does get up there (making it the most expensive).<br /><br />Blu-ray <br /><br />Built in wifi, no need in buying a battery kit or a plug n play kit<br /><br />Online is free<br /><br />Netflix works without having to pay anything (other than your netflix fee) opposed to having to be a "gold" member like you do on xbox.<br /><br />PS3 Cons<br /><br />Lackluster multi platform support (on older games, not really the case now) <br /><br />Not as many games<br /><br />Bottomline?  A 360 you can actually play, buy it and use and be safe in knowing that (it could!) last you a good 5 years or more. Something unheard of previously ;)

Awesome bundle!!
This is one awesome holiday bundle!!! I got it early because my previous 360 rrod'd and m$ said it would be $100 to fix it. So I went with the elite because the jasper chip that causes more efficient running, less heat and noise overall ... I think. The two games are awesome, two that I wanted. I am 23 by the way, so for anyone that says 12 and under pfft, Lego series games are popular with everyone, and racing games are awesome. Pure is an off road extreme atv game where its all about the tricks you pull. Two very awesome games. I haven't played them yet, but I'm a serious gamer so I watch videos and stuf like that. Xbox Live is THE STANDARD for online gaming now. Unmatched by anything else. It requires a subscription to play, but its worth it!! 1 month ~ $8 (if they still make those), 3 month ~ $20, and 12 month (with bonus month sometimes!) cards ~ $50. Thats about all you need to know.<br /><br /> Oh so in the box is the following: <br />-Xbox 360 console with the 120 gb HDD<br />-One wireless controller<br />-One Xbox Live headset<br />-One ethernet cable (8 foot)<br />-AV cable<br />-Power brick + connector power cable<br />-2 AA batteries (for controller)<br />-Holiday edition Pure/ Lego Batman games! (comes in one case, 2 separate discs)

perfect for youngsters
This is a good xbox 360 starter set for 12 and younger because it includes batman and pure which are two E games. Although, I don't really think this xbox 360 should have the title " elite ", because it doesn't include the hdmi, component or the audio cable in one big bundle like the 2008's bundle. Anyways, the console is a jasper so its much cooler and quiet, it's also not really vulnerable to rrod anymore. <br /><br />xbox live is a little overprised but its not laggy, i recommend you to use a ethernet cable instead of the 70$ adapter if your router is close by. This set also includes a controller, but if you are going to buy this set than you should also buy a extra controller, because lego batman is all about coop and pure has multiplayer. <br /><br />This also includes a 120 gb hardrive, which is huge. There is no need to buy a memory card because this might take your whole life to fill up. Also, the xbox store has alot of good demos, videos to download. The NXE dashboared is improved and easier to use and you can sign up for netflix if you have gold membership. If you have a hd tv its best to use a hdmi cable ,because the console can support resolutions of 1080p and support dolby digital. <br /><br />I think its best if you use it horizontally because the xbox can have more air intake, but if you plan to use vertically than i think you should buy a cooling stand. This console is definetely a good buy:)<br /><br />

Unbiased opinion
I purchased this holiday bundle when Amazon had it special for $275.  I can't say that I am disappointed.  While not perfect it is a far superior Xbox 360 than my 2007 model.  The only complaint that I have is that the disk tray feels more cheap and fragile than my 2007 model.  But other than that this newest elite is far superior in every way.  The power brick is smaller, the system is way, and I mean WAY quieter.  I cannot hear the console running over the noise of the tv even when I mute the sound.  Thank God Microsoft has a black version of their console because the white was starting to annoy me.  While the features in the newest elite bundle aren't what they used to be (data migration kit not included, no HDMI, or component/composite video cables included no longer) it still has everything you need to start playing right out of the box.  <br /><br />For those people complaining that the two bundled games only come in one game case here is what I have to say:  All the bundles that have ever come included with 2 free games have always had one game case to share between them.  Even the original xbox bundles were like that.  Nothing has changed.  Stop being a prince/princess of beggars and enjoy your 2 FREE games.  It's like asking for water in a restaurant... you aren't paying for it so shut up and stop complaining when they include a lemon slice on the rim of the glass.  You want something your way?  Pay for it.  Getting it for free? Suck it up.<br /><br />Oh and any of you PS3 fanboys thinking that the PS3 and Xbox 360 are so very different and that the PS3 is better than the 360 go read the book "The Race For A New Game Machine" or interviews with David Shippie and Mickie Phipps.  They will tell you that each system is superior to the other in certain ways... and that means in terms of CPU and GPU power and performance.  The Xbox 360's GPU is superior to the PS3's but the PS3 CPU's are superior to the Xbox 360 (more threads because it has more CPU chips).  <br /><br />I personally own both systems and see the potential for the PS3 coming to fruition.  It's a powerful console and online is free.  Plus I'm a big fan of being able to upgrade the harddrive size myself.  But the controller sucks and has always sucked.  And the games that come out on both consoles always look and perform better on the Xbox 360 (the exception of course being Dragon Age: Origins in the looks department). <br /><br /> The 360 you have to pay for online and the interface is a bit too kid friendly for me (but that could be a good thing because PS3's XMB is very sterile).  But the controller is superior and online service (costing $3/month thanks to Amazon) blows PSN out of the water.  With downloads becoming more common the idea that Xbox 360 games with remain 7 GB in size or have multiple disks is quickly becoming an outdated way of thinking.  But until then the 360 games will not live up to their full potential like PS3 games are allowed with 50 GB blu-ray discs.  And that Red Ring Of Death problem?  Never had it with my old console and I've played that thing many a time for 8-12 hours straight without breaks.  And I don't see this new console with it's near silent performance and no heat creation as having any problems.  But luckily Microsoft has a 3 year warranty for RROD and E74 errors so I'm covered.  Thanks Sony 1 year warranty.<br /><br />I hope you all enjoyed this review from someone that has both consoles and not just a single one spouting irrelevant garbage about the other without playing it first.

Both fancy AND schmancy!
This is the third 360 I've owned, and by far the one I'm most pleased with.<br /><br />First, it's quiter than the ones I've dealt with before. It makes a bit of noise but not nearly as much.<br /><br />Second, gotta love that black finish! I was always worried with my older systems about leaving smudges on the white control pad. No problem there now!<br /><br />Third, the 120GB hard drive that comes with it is pretty sweet. I was thinking about waiting until next week to get the 250GB drive, but I think 120 is more than enough, considering that I don't download tons of things onto there.<br /><br />Fourth, the HDMI port! I connected up a cable to my brand new HDTV and, oh, my goodness, does it look great!<br /><br />Last, the included games. Previously they bundled "Lego Indiana Jones" and "Kung Fu Panda". In this case you get "Lego Batman", which is a better game, and "Pure", which is much better than "Kung Fu Panda". I don't care for racing games, so I probably won't play it much, but at least I might play it more than once, which wasn't the case with KFP.<br /><br />Overall this is quite a good buy! You get the system, two games and a good sized hard drive for only $50 more than a system with half the drive space and no games. Really, there's no reason not to buy this system if you're after a 360!

Xbox holiday bundle...pure/lego batman
I am a long time user of XBOX products. I've owned Sony products. And to me, They just don't make the cut. The newer xbox's (This one included) Have a new chip in them...Code named "Jasper". And what this chip does, Is it runs at a lower and cooler point. Thus putting your risk for a hardware failure (ex: RROD) very low. Xbox has always had the best graphics, And best live and gaming expierience, In my opinion. I have red ringed one xbox. and that was one of the first models that came out. Since early 07, I have had no problems. I have never played Lego batman, But it seems like it has a pretty cool co-op mode for children, Pure is a different story, Pure is a great game for all ages. It takes strategy, Yet it's easy for anyone to play. You can design and customize your own ATV's, Race them, Jump them, Trick them. Anything really. The graphics are great, And I have expierienced no lag with the game (outside of XBOXLIVE) The elite comes with a few cool features, A huge hard drive, Store your music, Videos, Games. Sleek look. And a matching controller and headset. Streaming videos on XLIVE is easy with netflix. It's very convienient, And easy to use. Xbox Live doesn't cost much money, I spend 40 dollars for a year, And I play just about every day. It's well worth it. I personally use an xbox wireless adapter for game play. It works amazingly, I'm all the way across the house of a 3500 sq house, And I still get a strong signal. If you want good game play for all ages, Quality systems. And good game choices, Choose XBOX. and Keep your eye out for Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2. Releasing November 10th, 2009. Game looks AMAZING! NOTE: ALL XBOX CONSOLES COME WITH A 3 YEAR RED RING OF DEATH WARRANTY, AND A 1 YEAR WARRANTY FOR ALL OTHER XBOX RELATED ISSUES. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.

360 Elite Holiday Bundle
I have a PS3, a Wii, and this Xbox 360.  By far the best for gaming is the 360.  My wife plays the Wii, I play the 360, and we use the PS3 for media and movies.  I don't like playstation controllers so I cant stand playing games on it.  I love the 360 for gaming though.  This Holiday bundle could have come with some better games but maybe they are marketing it to kids and that is why they chose these games.  Christmas is coming up and every kid who doesn't have a 360 will want one.  With the holiday bundle you are guaranteed to get the newest version of the xbox which is supposed to be less likely to get the dreaded RROD.  So fingers crossed I hope it lasts forever and never dies on me, but for right now I am enjoying this system a lot.  Only negative thing I have to say about it is that it didn't even come with component cables, only that yellow video cable which sucks, you will want the component or an HDMI cable to get hi def gaming.

An awesome console and an awesome deal.
So I basically wanted an Xbox 360 for two reasons: 1. Dragon Age 2. Mass Effect 2. My computer would catch on fire if I tried to run either of those games on it and so my choices were either to spend a grand on a new laptop or super sweetly beg my awesome boyfriend for one for Christmas. Second choice was optimal. This is easily one of the best gifts I've ever gotten. We can watch movies on my laptop's hard drive in Xbox's Window Media Center. We can play all the songs on my or his ipod by just hooking it up to one of the console's USB ports. I can absolutely destroy him in Halo. It runs quietly even in the middle of Resident Evil 5 or Prince of Persia and never gets hot. <br /><br />As for the games that come with it: I haven't really touched Pure, but Lego Batman is adorable.

Much improved
I bought this to replace a 360 I bought shortly after they launched -- back when the only way to get one was on eBay.  While that one was perfectly fine it did have a few annoying drawbacks.  Mainly the noise and the heat.  Frankly, it was like having a space heater in the room as it would quickly get very hot in there.<br /><br />Well, I am glad to say this new Elite (manufactured in Aug 09) is almost totally silent and while slightly warm (although cooler than all my other electronics including my cable box), it no longer heats up like my other one did.  Throw in the 120GB hard drive (which now is really a must with all the downloadable games and content) and you have a great deal.<br /><br />In fact, one of the things that I love most and use my Xbox probably more than anything is the Netflix streaming.  Once you start using that, it's hard to imagine not having it.  While yes, not every DVD is available and the selection has primarily older releases, there is still more than enough to satisfy.  Who needs cable?<br /><br />The two games bundled with this are not great but their not bad.  They come boxed together in one clamshell -- so no cheap little sleeve like most bundles on other products.<br /><br />Also, the cables that come with this are different as I see with some other Elite consoles so be sure to check!<br /><br />I don't own a PS3 so I can't really make comparisons but I do own a Wii and never play it compared to my 360 (and the avatars on 360 make the Wii ones look pathetic).  There are tons of games available both by disc and download so you should be able to find something no matter what your taste.  <br /><br />I agree with the previous reviewer about this guy making all sorts of negative reviews on every xbox product that he doesn't even own most likely.  Obviously a PS3 shill.  While Xbox is not perfect -- yes in the past there was a high rate of failure (that should go way down now with the new versions) his reviews are completely off-base.  And since 360 game titles outsell PS3 ones 3-1, it's not hard to see where developers will put their budgets.  I will probably get a PS3 but really just as a Blu-Ray player when I feel like it down the road.<br /><br />So as a first time buyer or someone looking to replace their old one -- highly recommended!

Jasper, The Great
I don't play video games of ANY KIND; however, I do enjoy wacthing them being played by those for whom I purchase the systems. And, I must say that this "Jasper" surpasses, by far, any system that I have gifted - based on my observations coupled with enthusiatic feedback from it's recipients! There are times when everyone deliberately has stopped talking, laughing, yelling, etc. and the TV volume has been turned down (almost to mute) just to check for the "noise" that has plagued other 360s; and, there has been, AT WORST, only a very,very soft humming sound! We have noticed absolutely NO HEAT ISSUES, at all. Those to whom I gave the Jasper are constantly raving about this system's features (see other 5 star ratings for specifics - no need to duplicate here)! Most of all, they excitedly rave about how much fun they have playing games on it, which -in turn - makes me excitedly pleased/happy (to have afforded them the opportunity for such enjoyment)! <br /><br />Now, let's take a close look at something re: the negative reviewers: As of the time of this review, "ONLY 1" out of 10 "one star" reviewers, and "0" out of 4 "two star" reviewers has "AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE" beneath his/her name!!! Furthermore, even though this version (Jasper) was NOT RELEASED TILL 09/29/09, some of them refer to systems that went bad anywhere from 6 to 18 months after purchase, which makes it IMPOSSIBLE for them to be reviewing/rating THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM, as it became available only  4 MONTHS AGO)!!! I don't know about you, but when I take so much time to research a product (which includes reading lots of customer reviews/ratings), I appreciate hearing ONLY from those who actually own, use and/or have (at least) purchased the EXACT PRODUCT I'm considering buying!!! (I'm just saying...)

Get this bundle...
If you are looking to buy an Xbox 306.. do yourself a favor and buy this bundle. Not only does it come with two games (which are not system sellers but a good addition) it also comes with 120 GB hard drive and a HDMI slot. It also comes with a wireless controller and a wired headset. These are all great additions to the system. Considering that Amazon is now bundling a $50 gift card with every purchase, this item is a steal in my opinion. If you are planning to buy an Xbox, spend the additional $100 and buy this system. You will not regret it.<br /><br />Now, let me get to the rants. No WIRELESS!! Seriously Microsoft, this is not 2006. You cannot ask people to buy a $70 wireless adapter in 2010 when both Wii and PS3 have it built in to their systems. <br /><br />No HD cables. I understand most people still have SDTVs. The included cables can only output 480p. Most games on Xbox don't even support this mode anymore. Sure, the graphics are fine but you will end up with having to deal with blurry text in most games if you are playing with the standard cables shipped with Xbox. I suggest you get the HD cables from Microsoft for another $25 or so. <br /><br />Paying for Xbox live gold. The Wii online service and PS3 online service are both free. However, Xbox live is about $40 per year (usually $50). You will get a month of Xbox live trial gold with a purchase of this system. You will need it to stream Netflix movies, access Facebook, Twitter and Last.fm. The silver account is free but it is as good as not having an online service at all. (My suggestion is to snag it on ebay for $30 or less). There is also no browser like Wii or PS3.<br /><br />Other than the three things mentioned above, Xbox is a great system to play games. It already has a lot of great games to play. Most of them are available as Platinum Hits for a $20-$30 price range (about half as much as they initially sold for). There are also great new games like Dragon Age, Mass effect, Final Fantasy. Many more new games are coming this year including Microsoft's motion controller Project Natal. You will have ton of games to play. I will not compare it to PS3 as I do not own one. Comparing it to Wii (which I do own) will not do justice for either of them. They are both catered to different kinds of gamers.

So far, so good - Great service by Amazon and great direction from reviewers!
I wonder why some of these reviews are filled with XBOX360 vs PS3 battles only! I had obviously done a lot of research on the XBOX 360 before ordering it (by reading more legit comparison reviews both now and the last time I bought it). Without delving into comparisons with other consoles, I just want to say that the 360 is way cooler and has a much better appeal even with all known h/w issues in the past (Oops! did some console worshiping myself!). <br /><br />I used to own a pro which I sold while moving. I lived in constant fear of the RRoD but never had that issue with the old XBOX 360, thankfully. With more assurance from users and MS, and the lowered probability of failure with the Jasper chips, I decided to buy this elite bundle. The price is pretty good too. <br /><br />Amazon shipped this on time and I had my XBOX 3 days after ordering and selecting 2 day shipping. The experience of receiving things on time and as expected/predicted is great! Amazon's text message to my cell on the morning of delivery is a great feature too. <br /><br />If you are worried about finding a cheaper price on this product after ordering it, make sure you keep all packaging intact and quote 'cheaper price' as the specific reason for return (within 30 days). Amazon might even get you a free return shipping label.<br /><br />The bundled games are OK, but something to get you started if you don't want to spend on other games right away. Make sure you initially decline the XBL gold membership when you setup your XBOX Live account (you would be eligible for a 1 month free trial after declining the paid option of gold, and you can do this 2-3 times I believe). <br /><br />Don't bother overloading yourself with accessories (if you are a new gamer and are not sure what you would use). Just get the play and charge kit, any cables you need based on your TV, and a game or two to go with it. The 'Orange Box' disc is a good starter kit for the new gamer with 5 awesome games for just [...] bucks (Half life 2, HL2 episode 1, HL2 episode 2, Portal (same physics engine as half life, and an absolutely amazing game to get the mind juices flowing), team fortress (an online game)). Be sure to read the manual at least once if you are a new user and follow guidelines on optimum placement to avoid overheating and dust issues (like never put the console, or any cooling fan accessory base directly on a carpet or other porous material that could pick up dust and push it into the console)<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this product, the shipping, and accessories that I got/bought with it.

Love my 360 Elite
The 360 Elite is my 2nd Xbox 360. This isn't due to any issues with the first one, the 360 Pro (with 20G HD). Since the 360 Pro is located in our living room, my kids get most of the available playtime. We also have a Wii, but let face it, the games and graphics are much better on the 360. I decided if I wanted to play all of the great games I have, then it was time to get another 360 and put it in my bedroom. It shares the same monitor as my desktop PC and works out great. My friend has a PS3 and I don't have anything bad to say about it. I prefer Xbox and feel that most people would be happy with either system. Both have outstanding graphics and great games. Happy Holidays!!

A Powerful & Improved Gaming System
After owning the original iteration of the Xbox 360, the Elite edition has been a welcome upgrade from the original console.  The unit has a revamped power supply and processor which makes it run faster and cooler than it previously does. This means the likelihood of seeing the infamous Red Ring of Death (RROD) has been minimized and now Microsoft is even offering three years of coverage against the RROD which provides even more peace of mind. The black finish is very sleek and fits in nicely with a home entertainment system which includes many peripherals all of which are black in color. One thing to keep in mind is that this unit does NOT come with HDMI cables, so make sure you either order or have some laying around the house if you're intention is to play content in High Definition (HD).<br /><br />In terms of the games, neither that are bundled with this edition appeal to me thus I haven't played them.  On the other hand, I didn't buy the system because of the games, I bought it because of the system itself, so having a bad choice in bundled games shouldn't be an issue for those in similar positions as myself.<br /><br />

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox Live
I own both a xbox 360 and a ps3 and I prefer the xbox 360 for gaming because I find xbox live superior to playstation online. I also prefer the xbox 360 controller over the ps3 controller because it just fits my hands a lot better. I mainly use my ps3 for a blu-ray player and it is great value for that.

Easily one of my best purchases
This is my first console so I'm not sure how to benchmark it against anything else I've played before (except the Wii, but let's not go there). However, I was totally blown away by the gaming experience on the device. I've been playing Forza3 on it and have been completely hooked. The only downside I experienced was the loud CD/DVD drive. To get around this, I installed the game onto the hard drive and things are running along smoothly now. The load times have reduced dramatically too. As for the pricing, I think the console is cheap enough, but you'd have to shell out a bit to buy accessories that you almost can't do without, like a rechargeable battery for the controller. Other than that, it's a great purchase.

If you buy this from Amazon you won't be sorry.
*NOTE AGAIN THAT THIS WAS PURCHASED FROM AMAZON, NOT ANOTHER SELLER*<br /><br />A checklist that should tell you exactly why you want this.<br /><br />-This is a Microsoft refurbished console. That means it will be in 360 packaging with resealed cords, controllers, and headset (I'm tempted to say that my headset was brand new, and maybe even my cords, but I don't want to claim that without knowing. Regardless. There is something nice about not opening a clamshell sealed 360 that smells like lung cancer.) The condition is pristine. NO dirt or smudges. One sticker on the bottom that says refurbished. Mine left a bit of sticky when I took it off. Nail polish remover will get it off without pain if you are worried about that.<br /><br />-It will come with the new power-brick that is vented, it also has the new Jasper chip. This means: Even though you are getting a refurbished console, it is technically more sound than a brand new 20 gig from Microsoft's original batches. Rest easy my friend. This console was not made to break. It's like it got a tune up. These two features paired together will fight overheating and RED RING OF DEATH.<br /><br />-It does have HD<br /><br />-Mine came with 2 controllers, which at the time wasn't advertised (so it was a nice surprise). Cross your fingers about that if it's not openly included.   <br /><br />-If you don't already know, because it has a hard drive you will be able to connect to Xboxlive out of the box, though for online play I would recommend buying a 12 month live subscription. You can easily find them online for 35ish dollars. If you pay more you didn't look hard enough. :)<br /><br />Hope this helps in your decision. <br /><br />As for my console it runs like a charm, for long periods (when I say this I mean as I waste my whole day away) without any heat at all- and I can really tell the difference because I had a 60gig a few years back- the difference is black and white as far as heat output. I took it on a road-trip (to update it back home) for over 30 hours in total in a backpack that I threw around (gingerly) as I used the bag day to day. Came back home and it was still fine. DO IT. DO IT. DO IT NOW.  <br /><br />Happy Buying<br />

Good Product, reliable
I bought this refurbished item just over a year ago, and it is still working perfectly. I have since begun to use it more and more, and it has not given me any problems or issues whatsoever. I would reccomend the refurbished product to anyone trying to get into an xbox and not needing more than a 20g harddrive. If you feel that you would need more storage space, the amount of memory would be the only thing holding someone back from being on this system 24/7. The item came with everything listed, reliable purchase, I'm very glad with my purchase.

Refurbs are fine, too
Even though this is a refurbished unit, I haven't seen any problems with it in the first week.  I am glad I bought it via Amazon where I could get a certified refurb, though, rather than taking my chances on a cheaper Ebay model or something.  These units do have a bad reputation, and the warranty is just more peace of mind on my part.<br />

Turned out to be an upgrade for us.
My sons Halo edition xbox died the other day. We had it two and a half years and it had seen heavy use, so we got our moneys worth out of it. Instead of repair I thought it would be better to replace and get a new warranty. This referb turned out to be a great deal. It had the latest electronics and has an HDMI port so our TV is seeing 1080p. It seems faster than the old box too. Big thanks Amazon.

Great xbox 360 value!
I purchased this setup from amazon, not a  third party seller. Let me start by saying that this is a refurbished console by MICROSOFT, meaning that it comes with a one year warranty similar to buying a brand new system. When I got my package (with standard shipping it took 2 days!!) in the mail, everything was packaged very very nicely like I was buying a BRAND NEW system. The console itself looks brand new, NO SCRATCHES, NOTHING like that, it doesn't smell like cigarettes, and it works GREAT!!!! And YES it is a Jasper chipset, And YES it comes with HDMI port on the back. It comes with 2 BRAND NEW wireless controllers (they are NOT refurbished), 4 duracell batteries, HD component cables(NEW not refurbished), The new and improved power brick (brand new), and a brand new xbox live wired headset. The only things that came with this refurbished bundle that aren't brand new would be the console, and the 20 GB hard drive. Both of these things have stickers on them that read "refurbished". But seriously you can't even tell they aren't brand new! And you can tell everything else is brand new by the way it looks, and the stickers on the controllers etc. Seriously though, you won't be sorry that you bought this package! I will admit, at first I wasn't too thrilled with buying electronics that have been refurbished, as I would NEVER buy a gamestop refurbished unit! But this has been refurbished by MICROSOFT, so you know it has been repaired by the best, and in the process, they install the new jasper chip, which if you don't already know, makes the CPU run quieter and cooler, and supposedly prevents the dreaded red ring of death issue. Also you can see in the pictures that the console is an old pro unit by the chrome disk tray, but my console that came was an old arcade unit, because it has the all white disc tray..... But wrapping this up, im EXTREMELY happy with my purchase, It is such a better choice to get this rather than a brand new arcade system which is the same price, and I was EXTREMELY satisfied with amazon.com!!! I ordered this bundle, as well as NBA 2K10 on a Saturday night, and it shipped out on Monday morning, and it literally got to my house Tuesday early afternoon!!! If your thinking about getting this, DO IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!

Perfect, received exactly what I expected
No issues, have had it for 2 months now, and play it quite regularly. Came with 2 wireless controllers, and batteries for both. All in all, exactly what I wanted so don't fear buying it refurbished as long as you buy it directly from Amazon.

WOOOOOOOW
If your thinking of getting this product then be careful. Remember that it is suppose to come with all the accessories. Don't let the seller tell it doesn't. The seller I bough it from gave me a console and told me that's all I get. I filed a claim on him so I get my money's worth. I had to buy cables from a store to test if this was a working and fully functional machine. Luckily, it worked. I got to say it was amazing. I would definitely recommend this product. Just don't let anyone fool you. File a claim if anything is wrong, and as soon as you receive it... check if it works.

Xbox 360 is Awsome!!!
I bought this xbox 360 refurbished and it works excellent!!! It is just like any other regular xbox 360 that you buy at a retail store. It is cheaper and has one extra control plus the hd cable (which both would cost you more if bought seperately). I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND RECCOMEND IT 100% TO EVERYONE LOOKING TO BUY AN XBOX 360 SYSTEM!!! The great advantage of this is that it absolutely comes with its one year warranty so if it stops working you can get it fixed for free.

Awesome.
It works like a regular xbox 360. The controllers and all the accessories that came with it have no problem functioning. The only problem i have with this is that the xbox 360 itself is a little scratched up. But besides that everything works perfectly and i am very happy with my purchase.

Well worth the money
System was delivered the next day in brand new packaging, very impressed with the overall experience and would recommend others do the same vs. buying used on ebay or craigslist.<br />

The Best Thing Ive Ever Done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It Works Perfect And I Haven't Had Any Problems With It So Far. From When I Received It Ive Been Playing It For More Than 10 Hours And The Best Thing About It is That It Comes With A Year Warrenty. Everything Works Both Controllers, The Headset, All The Wires, And The System. So If Your Looking For An Xbox 360 With 20gb, 2 Controllers, And A Headset This Is It!!!!!

WHAT A GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!!!
I HAVE HAD MY XBOX FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND IT WORKING VERY NICE. I WAS DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THE XBOX REBURB. HAS THE JASPER CHIP SET IN THEM. THATS ALWAYS A PLUS. I WENT ON THE XBOX WEBSITE AND REGISTERED MY XBOX AND COME TO FOUND OUT THAT THE XBOX COMES WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY. I BOUGHT A EXTRA TWO YEAR WARRANTY ALSO. SO IF YOU DO THE MATH THATS THREE YEARS... THATS ADVANCE MATH..... ANOTHER GOOD THING ABOUT THIS XBOX IS THAT I COMES WITH A 20GB HARD DRIVE AND TWO CONTROLLERS,HDMI CABLE AND THE CONSOLE HAS THE HDMI INPUT...I THINK THAT THIS IS A BETTER DEAL THAN THE ARCADE VERSION. IF YOU HAVE A XBOX THAT HAVE THE THREE RED LIGHTS OR YOUR XBOX DOESN'T WORK, THIS ITEM IS A GREAT REPLACEMENT.

A must-have for XBox 360 Gamers
If you've got an XBox 360, you really need to get your hand on one or two wireless controllers. These controllers are GREAT for keeping your gaming area free of clutter. To start with, the controller is much smaller than the standard XBox controller was.<br /><br /> For control items, you start with the standard blue X, yellow Y, red B and green A buttons. There are two thumbsticks, one on the upper left and one in the center right. There is also a directional (d-pad) in the lower left.  <br /><br /><br />Next, you have a pair of shoulder buttons at the "top" of the unit, up above the other buttons. You also have a pair of triggers below those shoulder buttons.<br /><br />Finally, you have a center X button that can be used to turn the console on and off, plus a "start" and "back" tiny white buttons on either side of it. <br /><br />The unit has a rechargeable battery unit inside it, the size of two AA batteries. You have to buy a recharger set SEPARATELY that lets you charge up while you play. In essence you plug the charger into the back of the controller - and the other end into the USB port in the front of the XBox 360 unit. So you play with the controller "wired" as it charges up. When it's fully charged again, you just pop off the wire and keep playing.<br /><br />The range of the wireless unit is 30', which is probably much further than anybody is really going to even try playing a game at. The wireless is much easier on your hand - no cable holding you down - plus it's a great help in keeping your gaming area organized. You can easily pass the controller from person to person, and visitors can come and go without tripping over wires.<br /><br />The documentation says you can get 40 hours of gameplay between charges, but if you have features such as vibration on, that sucks the time down to maybe 8-10 hours. It's up to you of course - I personally like having vibration on because it is often important for gameplay to get those warning signals. <br /><br />Still, even if I have to plug the cables in every 10 hours or so to give it a juice boost, I still love wireless!! Highly recommended.

A slight improvement.
Ok, so this is basically just the white controller painted black. To be honest, the white controllers don't look too bad, its the white console that looks terrible. But that is my opinion. On to the facts. The black controller is almost exactly the same, but part of the grip is more "matte" than the white one. The white controller always makes me sweat for some reason because it is too smooth. These look great however. The colors are well matched even though it may not look like it in the pictures. I'd definitely recommend picking these up if you have an elite, or if you have core/premium and you want the black ones so the grime doesn't show as much, I'd highly recommend these.

Hands down, the best controller I have ever used.
I've gamed with almost every gamepad imaginable and never before have I used a controller that is so comfortable and easy to use. The Xbox 360 wireless controller is near flawless. Everything from its button layout to its build quality to its comfort level; it's all just perfect. <br /><br />Never before have my hands wrapped around a controller so naturally. Typically with a controller, you have to make your hands form to the controller in order to access all of the buttons, typically resulting in fingers getting jammed into each other uncomfortably or strecthed out across the controller awkwardly. With the 360 controller, my hands just mold into every angle of the design and my fingers effortlessly wrap around the controller's button layout.<br /><br />The button layout is as follows: Two analog sticks, D-Pad, four face buttons, two triggers, two shoulder buttons, start & back buttons, and the Xbox Guide Button. I'd give the layout and button design a 10/10. Everything is accessible without having to move your hands from the controller and everything has a solid, durable design. The triggers are smooth and glide with the motion of your fingers and are truly perfect. The shoulder buttons work just fine and are easily accessible (these are where the black and white buttons the from Xbox controller S went). The face buttons have great spring to them and don't feel mushy like the Playstation controller. The analog sticks are an 11/10. Compared to the PS controller in which you jam your fingers into each other and trying to correct out the play in the analog sticks, the 360's sticks are awesome; firm, precise, smooth gliding, and simply perfect. The D-Pad is unchanged from the Xbox controller, which wasn't good to begin with. It works and get the job done, but it could be better. The start and back buttons have moved to the middle of the controller and are better off in the center. And last but not least, the Xbox guide button (which needs a paragraph of its own). <br /><br />The Xbox guide button is a feature that is running 24/7 and is implemented straight into the 360 architecture and games. Even in the middle of a game, you can hit the Xbox guide button and access everything from your gamerscore, friend's lists, messages, music, achievements, game invites, etc. It can even take you back to the dashboard without even having to restart the console or remove the disc. When you're done with the dashboard, you just fire the game back up with even leaving the couch. When you want to turn off individual controllers or even turn off the console, simply hit the guide button. Want to turn on the console? Just hit the guide button. It's easily the best feature of the controller.<br /><br />Wireless technology = 10/10 Seamless integration with the console and an incredible stable connection with the console, even through walls, doors, etc; it'll even stay connected through different stories of a house. In over a year's time with the 360 wireless controller, I have NEVER lost my connection with the console. That's right, never. No interference with my wireless network, 2.4 ghz cordless phones, nothing. It is incredible how seamless it is. To connect a controller to a console, turn it on, press the link button on the controller and then the connect button on the console and almost magically, your controller is hooked right up and playing. And once your controller is connected to your console, you never have to link them together again; the next time you turn on your 360, the controller is automatically synched with the 360. If you want to add controllers to your 360, you simply synch them together with the same method that I just mentioned. Want to use your controller on a different 360? Simply synch them together and you're playing. The wireless technology with the 360 and its seamless integration is top-notch. Simply the fact that I will never have to deal with cords again makes the wireless controller more than worth the extra money. But with wireless, you have the issue with charging and batteries...<br /><br />I average about 25 hours per charge with my controller, although intense vibration feedback in games can drop that number down to about 20 hours. I get plenty of charge to last me through a week or two and when I run out of juice, I simply switch out my battery pack with the fresh pack sitting on my quick charge kit. The biggest problem with the wireless controller is the fact that you are literally forced into buying the rechargeable battery pack with the Play & Charge kit or the Quick Charge kit. It's not that big of a deal, but if you think you can get away with AA batteries, this controller will eat them for lunch, especially with rumble. Speaking of rumble, the motors in the 360 controller pack quite a punch and you'll end up paying more in batteries than the mere rechargeable pack costs. Everything from the roar of a machine gun to the light vibration of deflecting a pass to the jolt of a hard impact, everything on-screen is brought to life in your hands with this controller. And no, this isn't the same rumble like the PS2 or Xbox controller. The 360's rumble is more seamlessly integrated into games and serves a much more useful purpose in immersing you within the experience and can create all kinds of varied feedback effects like never before. I'd take this over six degrees of tilt any day.<br /><br />Overall, this controller is near flawless and hands down the best I have ever used. Comfort, wireless precision, durability; this controller packs it all into one sleek little controller.

Got Pink? 360 controller
If you've got an Xbox 360, you need controllers.  This pink one is perfect if you are comfortable in your masculinity, or if your favorite color is pink.  If you want to make this controller a bit more manly, take a black marker and draw a skull or two on it.<br /><br />The layout of the buttons on the Xbox 360 is amazing.  It's perfect for many of the games that are on the 360.  The rumble is effective, and the wireless capacity is wonderful.<br /><br />The only beef I have, is that I've had two controllers that become loose on the left analog stick, and they began to drag the cursor when not touched.  The Xbox Warranty I had from the console replaced them free of charge.  Luckily I had extra controllers to get me by in the week it took to replace it.<br /><br />When matched with the rechargable battery pack, they give you lots of gaming time between charges.

I'm a male and use this at work
I'm lucky enough to work at a software company where playing video games during lunch and evenings is widely accepted.  <br /><br />You must be wondering why a heterosexual male software engineer would purchase a "pink" controller for use in a group environment with other heterosexual males.<br /><br />Reasons:<br /><br />1) no one else will dare use this controller<br />2) when I clobber an opponent, it's even more humiliating to them that a pink controller was used<br />3) I like the shock value<br />4) chicks dig it (not that many are around, but I'm being proactive)

a must have!    you need this one!
if you have a xbox 360 system  you owe it to yourself to pick up a wireless controller..they are very comfortable to hold  and have all the functions of the regular controller..and whats very cool about  this one is if you get the plug and play charge kit..you can actually play while you charge the battery  or just have the controller hooked up after the system is shut off and it trickle charges for optimum performance...this  is worth the money..if you have the wired controller  trade up ..and go for the best.

I adore my PINK controller!
I love the Xbox 360 but it was hard sharing my husband's conroller because he always complained about me draining the batteries in it, lol.<br /><br />So I went and bought me my own, in PINK even!  He knows it is mine and he would not be caught dead using it.  So I don't have to worry about him draining my batteries, haha.<br /><br />I had a friend tell me that it was frivolous to get it in pink but I disagree.  It works and costs exactly the same as the white ones, so why not shake things up with some color?<br /><br />The pink is so cute and girly.  I really love it!

Microsoft got it right this time.  The battery life is no lie either, I easily play 30 - 40 hours on a set of AA batteries.  Best of all the headset hooks up to the controller and works wirelessly as well.<br /><br />Perfect

Good Stuff!
Well, seeing as though I'm a Halo fan, and was pretty disappointed in the Halo 3 Edition 360, because of it looking pretty plain, I decided to get this instead, really I think it was worth it if you're a Halo fan, the design I think is great, and the figurine, small, but very detailed. Now just like other people the only BIG problem I see is with the battery, it would have been nice to get a recharge pack or something, but all in all it's worth buying for the Halo fans.

Comfortable
These controllers are so much better than the first Xbox controllers. The shape fits your hands so prefectly. Although I have to say, best part is the no wires. I used to play with three other friends on the Xbox and whenever they leaved, the wires were all tangled up and I had to sit there for about 15 minutes just trying to untangle them. In this case, you don't have to stress. Another good part about this is that you can turn on the Xbox 360 with it, thats awesome. If you buy an Xbox 360 and you're not sure if you should spend the extra money on a wireless controller, trust me, its so much better, no hassle this way. I definately recommend this to Xbox 360 gamers.

quite possibly the best controller ever made
if you're one of the people who bought an original xbox, you all remember the "duke" controller that it launched with. the size and discomfort of this huge controller led to so much negative feedback that microsoft was forced to redesign it. in light of doing so, microsoft designed one of the best controllers on the market, known as the controller S. not wanting to repeat history, its obvious that microsoft carefully designed the new controller for their latest console, the xbox 360. to say that the wireless xbox 360 controller is the best i've used is an understatement.<br /><br />the first thing many gamers will notice is how incredibly light the controller is. in fact, the wireless is LIGHTER than the controller S for the original xbox, even with the battery pack on. the controller is also very comfortable to hold. with the combination of the above, gamers will be able to keep their eyes on the game, and not constantly have to look down at the controller to locate buttons. after some gaming, you almost forget you're even using a controller. <br /><br />if you've used a controller S before, you'll feel right at home with the xbox 360 wireless. this is essentially the same controller. there are still the 2 analog sticks, the d-pad, the 2 triggers, and of course, the A-X-Y-B buttons. the black and white buttons have both been removed, being replaced by the shoulder bumper buttons, which are on top of the controller. the back and start button are now beside the brand new "guide" button. the guide button is easily the coolest innnovation on the new controller. players can turn on the console with a single push of the button, among many other features. all of the buttons and both analog sticks feel much more responsive and workable (for lack of a better term) vs. the controller S.<br /><br />the ring of light around the controller is also very cool, because while you're playing, one of the 4 segments lights up to designate players 1-4. before launch, i was confused as to how the wireless controllers would work with no adapters, this is where the console comes in. with one press of a button on the xbox 360, the console automatically designates which controller will be players 1-4.<br /><br />performance wise, this controller is flawless. while microsoft says that the controller's range is 30 feet, i tested at >40ft and the controller still worked flawlessly. while i really don't think anyone will be playing any games from 30 feet away, its nice to know that the signal is so strong. the vibration is excellent on the controller, its strength is also adjustable.<br /><br />another nice thing for the controller is that the headset port is now on the bottom of the controller, so the wire for it can remain out of your way. if you've played on xbox live with the headset, you know how this could become frustrating.<br /><br />the battery life is supposebly 40 hours, but depending on how strong you have the vibration set and how far away you are playing, chances are you won't get nearly as many hours between charging.<br /><br />my only gripes are that the placement of the shoulder buttons can occasionally be mistaken for the triggers, and vice versa. this can be annoying in games like PGR3, where the trigger is brake, and the shoulder button is used to change the view, and the wrong press of one can lead to frustration. however, once you use the controller more, you get used to them and they shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />all in all, this the best controller to launch with a console ever. i strongly recommend picking up some of these, along with some extra battery packs, or the play and charge kits, which allow you to continue using the controller while the console charges it.<br /><br />9.5/10

Great controler
I have used this controler many times at my neighbors house, and it is basical the same thing as the S-controler, but with the start button moved to the center, and the white and black butttons mooved to the "shoulder" of the controler. This is a very comfortable controler and has great wireless range and the controllers precision is Phenomenal from the pressure sensitive triggers to the joysticks there flawles in my mind.<br /><br />this controller is WELL worht the money!! you sould also buy the play and charge kit so when the batterie runs low you can play uninterupted.

"Different"
Say you have a bunch of friends, and you all have 360's, and you decide to have a lan party. Everyone knows after a long time most people tend to not remember which controller is theirs. ( Especially when everyones drinking, or smoking.) This kind of helps the owner of it alleviate that problem... unless you want to have your name in magic marker on your controller. Being the only black controller at our LAN parties makes it easily distinguishable for me and I dont leave with someone elses controller, cuz who knows what other people touch  before they play xbox.

Not quite as ugly as it looks
I bought this one because I found it on sale.  It is not quite as bright and ugly as it looks in the picture, but it isn't dark blue either.  A nice plus is that it won't get yellowish like the white ones do over time.  I also have the blue rechargeable battery pack which is now available.  Other then the color it is the same as any other 360 controller, which is in my opinion the greatest controller of all time, absolutely perfect except the D-pad can be a bit weird.  Would buy again.

Wireless controllers are the way to go.
First, I would like to say that this controller is LEAGUES above the original XBox controller as far as comfort goes. I used to swear by the PS2 Dualshock controller (yeah, I know you XBox fanboys just cringed cuz I said PS2, but I don't care, I just love games). Anyways, I didn't think any controller could best the PS2 Dualshock. I was wrong. This wireless controller is actually extremely comfortable, even more-so then the Dualshock. Also, unlike the new PS3 SixAxis controller, it actually feels nice and solid, not cheap and plasticy. I absolutely love it. <br /><br />Wireless is definitely the way to go. I have two extremely hyper Australian Shepherds and I can't tell you how many cords they've chewed, or how many times they've ran through my living room and tripped over cords from other controllers i've owned in the past - causing either the controller or the console to come crashing down. It's like the difference between having a typical universal remote for your TV and having a universal remote for your TV with a cord (yeah, they don't exist with cords but imagine if they did... just not quite right) - or it's like the difference between a infared cordless mouse and a ball-and-chain mouse. My couch is just far enough from my TV so that when I am using a controller with a cord I have to lean over so my cord isn't stretching across the living room. This controller frees me from that, I can just sit back and relax now. It's SO much better. I like how the analog sticks are placed on this controller. When I use the Dualshock now it seems like the analog sticks are much too low. This controller feels perfectly natural.<br /><br />There is one tiny complaint though. I almost knocked it down to four stars but I just couldn't. I would give this controller a 4.5/5 if I could. My complaint is that the analog sticks slip a tiny bit sometimes - which doesn't happen on the Dualshock because the analog sticks on the Dualshock are coated in rubber, as opposed to the plastic analog sticks for this controller. This is only slightly annoying for me in games like Gears Of War where perfect aiming is essential. It's a bit easier for me to aim with the Dualshock controller. Perhaps this is just an issue because I'm so used to the Dualshock. Other people don't seem to have this problem so it's probably just me.<br /><br />This controller RULES! Get it! oh and get the rechargeable battery kit too, you'll thank me later.

Next Generation Controller
Truly a fascinating controller! This controller's performance is outstanding. There is no delay at all and is much more comfortable than even the first XBOX controller. Do not buy third-part wireless controllers. This is it if you are looking for quality and precision. It is so powerful that even if I, just for testing, try it from the most outrageous angle, it works.

Get A grip
This joystick is the best stick so far. The ability to power on the console, open and close the disc tray, complete control of the 360 interface, light good feeling and a comfort fit, and most of all wire less. I recommend getting a play and charge kit, mainly because changing out the batteries is costly the kit will save hundreds in the future years on battery cost. Now in my opinion when you think about all the sticks that have come out this stands out in the best way Microsoft has found a way to out do the comp. again. I don't want you to think that this is a joke I own 3 and recharge about once every 2 weeks. Nothing interferes with the signal at all not my Nextel, home phone, thunderstorms, rain, snow, "nothing." If you have a 360 YOU NEED this BABBY.

Love the controller
I have had gaming systems since the day of the Atari 2600. From the single joystick to the Nintendo pad to the 360 I have played with all of them. I have to say that the people at Microsoft did an excellent job in developing this controller. <br /><br />It is lightweight, comfortable and is very easy to use with all games. I highly recommend getting the black controller, it looks and feels better. You cannot beat the wireless function and unlike the controllers of old, you do not need to face it directly at the console.

It's up to you of course - I personally like having vibration on because it is often important for gameplay to get those warning signals. <br /><br />Still, even if I have to plug the cables in every 10 hours or so to give it a juice boost, I still love wireless!! Highly recommended.

A slight improvement.
Ok, so this is basically just the white controller painted black. To be honest, the white controllers don't look too bad, its the white console that looks terrible. But that is my opinion. On to the facts. The black controller is almost exactly the same, but part of the grip is more "matte" than the white one. The white controller always makes me sweat for some reason because it is too smooth. These look great however. The colors are well matched even though it may not look like it in the pictures. I'd definitely recommend picking these up if you have an elite, or if you have core/premium and you want the black ones so the grime doesn't show as much, I'd highly recommend these.

Hands down, the best controller I have ever used.
I've gamed with almost every gamepad imaginable and never before have I used a controller that is so comfortable and easy to use. The Xbox 360 wireless controller is near flawless. Everything from its button layout to its build quality to its comfort level; it's all just perfect. <br /><br />Never before have my hands wrapped around a controller so naturally. Typically with a controller, you have to make your hands form to the controller in order to access all of the buttons, typically resulting in fingers getting jammed into each other uncomfortably or strecthed out across the controller awkwardly. With the 360 controller, my hands just mold into every angle of the design and my fingers effortlessly wrap around the controller's button layout.<br /><br />The button layout is as follows: Two analog sticks, D-Pad, four face buttons, two triggers, two shoulder buttons, start & back buttons, and the Xbox Guide Button. I'd give the layout and button design a 10/10. Everything is accessible without having to move your hands from the controller and everything has a solid, durable design. The triggers are smooth and glide with the motion of your fingers and are truly perfect. The shoulder buttons work just fine and are easily accessible (these are where the black and white buttons the from Xbox controller S went). The face buttons have great spring to them and don't feel mushy like the Playstation controller. The analog sticks are an 11/10. Compared to the PS controller in which you jam your fingers into each other and trying to correct out the play in the analog sticks, the 360's sticks are awesome; firm, precise, smooth gliding, and simply perfect. The D-Pad is unchanged from the Xbox controller, which wasn't good to begin with. It works and get the job done, but it could be better. The start and back buttons have moved to the middle of the controller and are better off in the center. And last but not least, the Xbox guide button (which needs a paragraph of its own). <br /><br />The Xbox guide button is a feature that is running 24/7 and is implemented straight into the 360 architecture and games. Even in the middle of a game, you can hit the Xbox guide button and access everything from your gamerscore, friend's lists, messages, music, achievements, game invites, etc. It can even take you back to the dashboard without even having to restart the console or remove the disc. When you're done with the dashboard, you just fire the game back up with even leaving the couch. When you want to turn off individual controllers or even turn off the console, simply hit the guide button. Want to turn on the console? Just hit the guide button. It's easily the best feature of the controller.<br /><br />Wireless technology = 10/10 Seamless integration with the console and an incredible stable connection with the console, even through walls, doors, etc; it'll even stay connected through different stories of a house. In over a year's time with the 360 wireless controller, I have NEVER lost my connection with the console. That's right, never. No interference with my wireless network, 2.4 ghz cordless phones, nothing. It is incredible how seamless it is. To connect a controller to a console, turn it on, press the link button on the controller and then the connect button on the console and almost magically, your controller is hooked right up and playing. And once your controller is connected to your console, you never have to link them together again; the next time you turn on your 360, the controller is automatically synched with the 360. If you want to add controllers to your 360, you simply synch them together with the same method that I just mentioned. Want to use your controller on a different 360? Simply synch them together and you're playing. The wireless technology with the 360 and its seamless integration is top-notch. Simply the fact that I will never have to deal with cords again makes the wireless controller more than worth the extra money. But with wireless, you have the issue with charging and batteries...<br /><br />I average about 25 hours per charge with my controller, although intense vibration feedback in games can drop that number down to about 20 hours. I get plenty of charge to last me through a week or two and when I run out of juice, I simply switch out my battery pack with the fresh pack sitting on my quick charge kit. The biggest problem with the wireless controller is the fact that you are literally forced into buying the rechargeable battery pack with the Play & Charge kit or the Quick Charge kit. It's not that big of a deal, but if you think you can get away with AA batteries, this controller will eat them for lunch, especially with rumble. Speaking of rumble, the motors in the 360 controller pack quite a punch and you'll end up paying more in batteries than the mere rechargeable pack costs. Everything from the roar of a machine gun to the light vibration of deflecting a pass to the jolt of a hard impact, everything on-screen is brought to life in your hands with this controller. And no, this isn't the same rumble like the PS2 or Xbox controller. The 360's rumble is more seamlessly integrated into games and serves a much more useful purpose in immersing you within the experience and can create all kinds of varied feedback effects like never before. I'd take this over six degrees of tilt any day.<br /><br />Overall, this controller is near flawless and hands down the best I have ever used. Comfort, wireless precision, durability; this controller packs it all into one sleek little controller.

Got Pink? 360 controller
If you've got an Xbox 360, you need controllers.  This pink one is perfect if you are comfortable in your masculinity, or if your favorite color is pink.  If you want to make this controller a bit more manly, take a black marker and draw a skull or two on it.<br /><br />The layout of the buttons on the Xbox 360 is amazing.  It's perfect for many of the games that are on the 360.  The rumble is effective, and the wireless capacity is wonderful.<br /><br />The only beef I have, is that I've had two controllers that become loose on the left analog stick, and they began to drag the cursor when not touched.  The Xbox Warranty I had from the console replaced them free of charge.  Luckily I had extra controllers to get me by in the week it took to replace it.<br /><br />When matched with the rechargable battery pack, they give you lots of gaming time between charges.

I'm a male and use this at work
I'm lucky enough to work at a software company where playing video games during lunch and evenings is widely accepted.  <br /><br />You must be wondering why a heterosexual male software engineer would purchase a "pink" controller for use in a group environment with other heterosexual males.<br /><br />Reasons:<br /><br />1) no one else will dare use this controller<br />2) when I clobber an opponent, it's even more humiliating to them that a pink controller was used<br />3) I like the shock value<br />4) chicks dig it (not that many are around, but I'm being proactive)

a must have!    you need this one!
if you have a xbox 360 system  you owe it to yourself to pick up a wireless controller..they are very comfortable to hold  and have all the functions of the regular controller..and whats very cool about  this one is if you get the plug and play charge kit..you can actually play while you charge the battery  or just have the controller hooked up after the system is shut off and it trickle charges for optimum performance...this  is worth the money..if you have the wired controller  trade up ..and go for the best.

I adore my PINK controller!
I love the Xbox 360 but it was hard sharing my husband's conroller because he always complained about me draining the batteries in it, lol.<br /><br />So I went and bought me my own, in PINK even!  He knows it is mine and he would not be caught dead using it.  So I don't have to worry about him draining my batteries, haha.<br /><br />I had a friend tell me that it was frivolous to get it in pink but I disagree.  It works and costs exactly the same as the white ones, so why not shake things up with some color?<br /><br />The pink is so cute and girly.  I really love it!

I've never used a better controller
Microsoft got it right this time.  The battery life is no lie either, I easily play 30 - 40 hours on a set of AA batteries.  Best of all the headset hooks up to the controller and works wirelessly as well.<br /><br />Perfect

Good Stuff!
Well, seeing as though I'm a Halo fan, and was pretty disappointed in the Halo 3 Edition 360, because of it looking pretty plain, I decided to get this instead, really I think it was worth it if you're a Halo fan, the design I think is great, and the figurine, small, but very detailed. Now just like other people the only BIG problem I see is with the battery, it would have been nice to get a recharge pack or something, but all in all it's worth buying for the Halo fans.

Comfortable
These controllers are so much better than the first Xbox controllers. The shape fits your hands so prefectly. Although I have to say, best part is the no wires. I used to play with three other friends on the Xbox and whenever they leaved, the wires were all tangled up and I had to sit there for about 15 minutes just trying to untangle them. In this case, you don't have to stress. Another good part about this is that you can turn on the Xbox 360 with it, thats awesome. If you buy an Xbox 360 and you're not sure if you should spend the extra money on a wireless controller, trust me, its so much better, no hassle this way. I definately recommend this to Xbox 360 gamers.

quite possibly the best controller ever made
if you're one of the people who bought an original xbox, you all remember the "duke" controller that it launched with. the size and discomfort of this huge controller led to so much negative feedback that microsoft was forced to redesign it. in light of doing so, microsoft designed one of the best controllers on the market, known as the controller S. not wanting to repeat history, its obvious that microsoft carefully designed the new controller for their latest console, the xbox 360. to say that the wireless xbox 360 controller is the best i've used is an understatement.<br /><br />the first thing many gamers will notice is how incredibly light the controller is. in fact, the wireless is LIGHTER than the controller S for the original xbox, even with the battery pack on. the controller is also very comfortable to hold. with the combination of the above, gamers will be able to keep their eyes on the game, and not constantly have to look down at the controller to locate buttons. after some gaming, you almost forget you're even using a controller. <br /><br />if you've used a controller S before, you'll feel right at home with the xbox 360 wireless. this is essentially the same controller. there are still the 2 analog sticks, the d-pad, the 2 triggers, and of course, the A-X-Y-B buttons. the black and white buttons have both been removed, being replaced by the shoulder bumper buttons, which are on top of the controller. the back and start button are now beside the brand new "guide" button. the guide button is easily the coolest innnovation on the new controller. players can turn on the console with a single push of the button, among many other features. all of the buttons and both analog sticks feel much more responsive and workable (for lack of a better term) vs. the controller S.<br /><br />the ring of light around the controller is also very cool, because while you're playing, one of the 4 segments lights up to designate players 1-4. before launch, i was confused as to how the wireless controllers would work with no adapters, this is where the console comes in. with one press of a button on the xbox 360, the console automatically designates which controller will be players 1-4.<br /><br />performance wise, this controller is flawless. while microsoft says that the controller's range is 30 feet, i tested at >40ft and the controller still worked flawlessly. while i really don't think anyone will be playing any games from 30 feet away, its nice to know that the signal is so strong. the vibration is excellent on the controller, its strength is also adjustable.<br /><br />another nice thing for the controller is that the headset port is now on the bottom of the controller, so the wire for it can remain out of your way. if you've played on xbox live with the headset, you know how this could become frustrating.<br /><br />the battery life is supposebly 40 hours, but depending on how strong you have the vibration set and how far away you are playing, chances are you won't get nearly as many hours between charging.<br /><br />my only gripes are that the placement of the shoulder buttons can occasionally be mistaken for the triggers, and vice versa. this can be annoying in games like PGR3, where the trigger is brake, and the shoulder button is used to change the view, and the wrong press of one can lead to frustration. however, once you use the controller more, you get used to them and they shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />all in all, this the best controller to launch with a console ever. i strongly recommend picking up some of these, along with some extra battery packs, or the play and charge kits, which allow you to continue using the controller while the console charges it.<br /><br />9.5/10

Great controler
I have used this controler many times at my neighbors house, and it is basical the same thing as the S-controler, but with the start button moved to the center, and the white and black butttons mooved to the "shoulder" of the controler. This is a very comfortable controler and has great wireless range and the controllers precision is Phenomenal from the pressure sensitive triggers to the joysticks there flawles in my mind.<br /><br />this controller is WELL worht the money!! you sould also buy the play and charge kit so when the batterie runs low you can play uninterupted.

"Different"
Say you have a bunch of friends, and you all have 360's, and you decide to have a lan party. Everyone knows after a long time most people tend to not remember which controller is theirs. ( Especially when everyones drinking, or smoking.) This kind of helps the owner of it alleviate that problem... unless you want to have your name in magic marker on your controller. Being the only black controller at our LAN parties makes it easily distinguishable for me and I dont leave with someone elses controller, cuz who knows what other people touch  before they play xbox.

Not quite as ugly as it looks
I bought this one because I found it on sale.  It is not quite as bright and ugly as it looks in the picture, but it isn't dark blue either.  A nice plus is that it won't get yellowish like the white ones do over time.  I also have the blue rechargeable battery pack which is now available.  Other then the color it is the same as any other 360 controller, which is in my opinion the greatest controller of all time, absolutely perfect except the D-pad can be a bit weird.  Would buy again.

Wireless controllers are the way to go.
First, I would like to say that this controller is LEAGUES above the original XBox controller as far as comfort goes. I used to swear by the PS2 Dualshock controller (yeah, I know you XBox fanboys just cringed cuz I said PS2, but I don't care, I just love games). Anyways, I didn't think any controller could best the PS2 Dualshock. I was wrong. This wireless controller is actually extremely comfortable, even more-so then the Dualshock. Also, unlike the new PS3 SixAxis controller, it actually feels nice and solid, not cheap and plasticy. I absolutely love it. <br /><br />Wireless is definitely the way to go. I have two extremely hyper Australian Shepherds and I can't tell you how many cords they've chewed, or how many times they've ran through my living room and tripped over cords from other controllers i've owned in the past - causing either the controller or the console to come crashing down. It's like the difference between having a typical universal remote for your TV and having a universal remote for your TV with a cord (yeah, they don't exist with cords but imagine if they did... just not quite right) - or it's like the difference between a infared cordless mouse and a ball-and-chain mouse. My couch is just far enough from my TV so that when I am using a controller with a cord I have to lean over so my cord isn't stretching across the living room. This controller frees me from that, I can just sit back and relax now. It's SO much better. I like how the analog sticks are placed on this controller. When I use the Dualshock now it seems like the analog sticks are much too low. This controller feels perfectly natural.<br /><br />There is one tiny complaint though. I almost knocked it down to four stars but I just couldn't. I would give this controller a 4.5/5 if I could. My complaint is that the analog sticks slip a tiny bit sometimes - which doesn't happen on the Dualshock because the analog sticks on the Dualshock are coated in rubber, as opposed to the plastic analog sticks for this controller. This is only slightly annoying for me in games like Gears Of War where perfect aiming is essential. It's a bit easier for me to aim with the Dualshock controller. Perhaps this is just an issue because I'm so used to the Dualshock. Other people don't seem to have this problem so it's probably just me.<br /><br />This controller RULES! Get it! oh and get the rechargeable battery kit too, you'll thank me later.

Next Generation Controller
Truly a fascinating controller! This controller's performance is outstanding. There is no delay at all and is much more comfortable than even the first XBOX controller. Do not buy third-part wireless controllers. This is it if you are looking for quality and precision. It is so powerful that even if I, just for testing, try it from the most outrageous angle, it works.

Get A grip
This joystick is the best stick so far. The ability to power on the console, open and close the disc tray, complete control of the 360 interface, light good feeling and a comfort fit, and most of all wire less. I recommend getting a play and charge kit, mainly because changing out the batteries is costly the kit will save hundreds in the future years on battery cost. Now in my opinion when you think about all the sticks that have come out this stands out in the best way Microsoft has found a way to out do the comp. again. I don't want you to think that this is a joke I own 3 and recharge about once every 2 weeks. Nothing interferes with the signal at all not my Nextel, home phone, thunderstorms, rain, snow, "nothing." If you have a 360 YOU NEED this BABBY.

Love the controller
I have had gaming systems since the day of the Atari 2600. From the single joystick to the Nintendo pad to the 360 I have played with all of them. I have to say that the people at Microsoft did an excellent job in developing this controller. <br /><br />It is lightweight, comfortable and is very easy to use with all games. I highly recommend getting the black controller, it looks and feels better. You cannot beat the wireless function and unlike the controllers of old, you do not need to face it directly at the console.

IT IS A JASPER. Worth the money so far....
Ok, short story about what happened to me.... Saturday, before MW2 came out, my Falcon Elite displayed an E74 error message. My falcon had been "repaired" before due to RROD. So as you all can understand, I was pretty pissed off. Anyway, since amazon claimed this bundle was the "newest" version (newest chip), I decided to take the plunge and get it. My Falcon will be back from Microsoft next week and I plan to sell it, now that I have the MW2 console.<br /><br />Anyway, so far, this bundle is the "newest version" and a must buy IMO, why? it comes with TWO controllers, a 250G HD and Modern Warfare 2. Reviewers have made arguments about the controllers feeling either smaller or cheap..take it from an actual Elite owner...the controllers or console's obvious built is NOT different than previous Elite versions, someone said something about this console  having "too much plastic",so I guess they were refering to the DVD tray; it is now all black, the regular Elite tray is silver, this of course does not mean it is metal, it is still plastic.<br /><br />Anyway, you will get the following in this bundle: two black controllers, an ethernet cable, a basic video cable (not a componet one), NO HDMI cable, a black headset, and the 250G HD, MW2 regular edition and that's pretty much it. <br /><br />Now, how do I know this is a Jasper console? The power brick is smaller and the voltage is different compared to the Falcon Elites. It does run smoother and the noise from the DVD drive has been taken down a notch.<br /><br />I should mention though, that so far,  I have been forced to use my Falcon Elite' 120G HD, because Microsoft's customer support claims they are out of the "data transfer kits", that I MUST WARN YOU, now cost $12 and you can only buy it from MS. Quick tip: Microsoft's CS hours are US Eastern time, so, if you call in early, they will have the transfer kits, if you call too late, near their closing time (1:00am US easterm time), they'll claim to be out of kits, trust me, I called them at least 4 times.<br /><br />Now, about the over all look of the console, honestly, it does look good, but $400 good?? not really. The only reason for anybody to buy this console is the HD storage room, plus the fact that if you do the "math", the bundle is a pretty good deal, because a normal Elite will cost you $300, that's with only one controller and no game. Anyway, if you have a 120G Elite with plentyof HD space; this bundle is a matter of wanting to upgrade to a bigger HD, having a broken/malfunctioning Elite like mine or simply having the cash to spend.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />

MW2 Bundle...Awesome
Pre-ordered this bundle back in September, was worried at first about the release date shipping. This is my first release date purchase through Amazon. Received it at 10 am on release date...awesome. Now that we have that out of the way. This bundle is a great deal for first time Xbox users/purchasers. Comes with 2 controllers, this is great for a family purchase....no more children fighting over taking turns until you get to the store to purchase another controller. The 250 GB harddrive is great. I currently own 2 other 360's(one is mine, the other purchased for my wife) both 20gb. With all of the music, movies, and DLC I have had to constantly delete stuff that I have paid for just to make room for new games. This led me to purchase the 250GB harddrive, after transferring everything over I still have TONS of room to install all of my most played games. (For those of you new to 360's...this helps the games run smoother with less load times and it keeps the noise level down on the system). If you are a fan of the COD franchise or even new this 360 is great! The black 360 with the custom MW2 theme looks great. I have always thought about painting my other 360 black to make it look better in my entertainment center...black 58" tv, black surround sound system, black cable box, black modem, and lastly a black PS3. A White xbox stands out quite a bit amongst all of this equipment. I would highly recommend this purchase to people just starting out with the new gaming system or even hardcore 360 players who are just looking to expand the experience. I know this review is getting extensive but im just trying to cover everything....now on to the MW2 game. SIMPLY AMAZING! Looks great, sounds great, plays great. I have been into the COD franchise for quite a while, have been religiously playing COD 4 MW for over 2 years now and can see myself playing this one for another 2 as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! Thanks for reading the review and happy gaming! -J.Fox

Time for an upgrade
I bascially decided to pick this up for two reasons. <br />1. My wife yes my wife was hogging the console for Netflix, movies and the occasional game. She was addicted to Fable 2.<br />2. I've had the old Pro version for almost 3 years and I was tired of deleting stuff off of my hard drive in order to make room for a new game I just loaded.<br />3. This was a great deal. <br />Consider this a standard elite console is $299.99, a copy of MW2 is 59.99 and an additional controller is 49.99 add those to the price and guess what it's higher than the cost of this. So look at it this way you basically get the bonus of a 250 Gb hard drive for free. <br /><br />To be totally honest as cool as the console looks in person it's not as awesome in person because It doesn't have as much of a gun metal look as I had hoped but that's okay because I'm more concerned about the hard ware. <br /><br />It does run cooler way cooler than my old one and even the DVD drive is quieter. Is it as quiet as my PS3 no but it's close. A good buy lower power consumption and much more quiet. Just think MS if you had released this product in this format 2 years ago Sony would be toast because all of their advantages have been hardware based and this is the best I've seen on the market from Microsoft for hardware. It's not enough to make a PS3 owner want to switch but It's a better deal than the PS3 250 gb version that's out for those out there who can't decide.

Great console! 250GB Elite AND Modern Warfare 2!!!
I could list pros and cons but why? There are only pros to buying this setup. So on to the pros:<br /><br />Modified Xbox 360 Elite color scheme that fits in well with other components of a home theater system.<br />Modern Warfare 2 game.<br />250GB hard drive.<br />Two black wireless controllers.<br /><br />Great price for the included goodies. I just wish it came with a HDMI cable, I knew that it didn't I just wish it had.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, the jewel case for MW2 was fractured badly and I had to replace it with a generic one. That seems odd that this issue has come up repeatedly.<br /><br />-Me<br />

Very, Very Good Deal For Your Dollar
Hello to all, first i would like to say that i am a 30 year old gamer playing since the atari days and secondly this is my first review. When you look at the price tag thats a lot of money for a game system but you have to take a look at what you are getting. You are getting a jasper Xbox which will run you $299 that comes with a 120 GB hard drive, one controller, and i think a headset (not real sure about the head set). For an extra $100 this bundle will get you a 250 GB hard drive, an extra controller, and a copy of Modern Warfare 2. I'm thinking how M$ prices its accessories that the 250 GB hard drive alone will run you over $150 or more. So in conclusion I think for the extra $100 you get a great deal

Love this thing!
The ONLY negative that I have to say about this is that it didn't come with a data transfer kit to move data from your old 360 to your new one.  You have to purchase the new one by calling XBOX360 customer support (or going on line) and its a $12 charge.  BUT they were all out and didn't know when they were getting more in.  So I painstakingly re-downloaded all my content after transferring my license.  It took 3 days, but the beauty of it, I was able to do it from the xbox360 site.  So everything downloaded fine and this XBOX360 is the bomb.  Now with he bigger hard-drive, I can download those XBOX original games.  Plus you can install the MW2 on the 360 and play it from the hard-drive (you still need the disc to act as a catalyst).  The reason you want to do this is that in the long run, it saves the wear and tear on the XBOX because the disc isn't constantly running.  <br /><br />As far as the game itself, it is difficult on any level which I really like.  You will die a lot, one of the coolest thing is to ride the snowmobile.  So single play is very very good and multi-play is awesome (even though I get smoked alot).  I like the design of the box itself and it seems quieter than my previous system.  <br /><br />399.00 is a great price considering you are getting 2 controllers, the game and 250GB HD, headset and the system.  It doesn't come with a HDMI cable, but you can get one of those cheap nowadays.  And the wireless controllers are not the rechargeable kind.  So you are going to have to buy an extra battery pack if you don't already have one.  Its good to be consistent and buy the black rechargeable packs.  <br /><br />The XBOX360 as a whole w/XBOX Live is far more enjoyable than the PS3, in my humble opinion.  Because if you have netflix, with the 360 you can put movies in your instant cue and watch them immediately, with no disc to insert (unlike the PS3).  And they just added last.fm, facebook, twitter and zune.  <br /><br />In the end, if buy a lot of content from the XBOX Live Marketplace, than this is the system you want, the 250GB, if not, you can't go wrong with 120GB xbox-360.

Excellent Hardware & Very Good Deal
The release of Modern Warfare was highly anticipated, and I pre-ordered my copy months ago. I also caught of glimpse of the Modern Warfare console and thought wow that is really cool looking and actually a great deal.  I ordered it and received it Saturday from Amazon.  <br /><br />Console:  The console is the black elite (matte) color with a nice gray accent on the top, some small gray graphics and lettering on the face plate, and a large "2" on the bottom (or left side if your stand yours up).  One thing I liked is the removal of the chrome disc tray for a solid black one.  The console looks really clean and nice, not overwhelming like the Halo console, or retina burning Resident Evil 5 console.  <br /><br />Accessories:  This is what makes the package such a bargain, while it still lacks an HDMI cable, it makes up for with a nice list of other stuff.  First the standard copy of CoD:MW2, a black elite wired headset, two black elite wireless controllers, a huge 250gb HDD, and an ethernet cable. On top of your standard issue power "brick" and standard composite audio/video cables.  <br /><br />Extras:  The hard drive is initially eaten up by arcade game trials (at least 15), game videos, and some older themes and gamer pictures.  After deleting everything, and transferring my saves, content, and gamer profile I'm sitting at a comfortable 227gb.  My only issue with the console package was it didn't include any Modern Warfare 2 glitz and glitter on the inside.  I purchased the MW2 premium theme, which looks very cool, however I felt it could have been included with the package.  Not a deal breaker by any means but its the small things ha ha.  <br /><br />After opening this up (even the box looks awesome) I must say I'm 99.99% thrilled to have this package, with the .01% being the lack of a theme or some other sort of MW2 items, again I'm just being picky.  If you don't own a 360, even if you don't play shooters or MW2 for that matter, this may still be your best package deal.  I will throw in though once you try the included MW2 game you might just be hooked!

Awesome Xbox 360 Bundle
This is probably the best collectors edition Xbox 360 I have seen so far.  My first Xbox 360 died after 3 years so I went out and purhcased this console.  It comes with 2 wireless controllers, headset, 250GB Hard Drive, and built in HDMI.  The price is perfect because you are saving money when you buy it as a bundle and you get more for what you pay.  The biggest dissapointment is no HDMI cable but thanks to www.amazon.com you can get a cable for 3$.<br /><br />I recommend this bundle to anyone shopping for the holiday season because it comes with one of the best online shooter games ever made.

Microsoft hits homeruuuuunnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I must be a little more computer literate then your average joe but i just dont get burned by Microsoft like other people do. Granted they are a little buggy sometimes with there stuff but overall i think there products are cutting edge and geared to make consumers lives easier more productive as well as enjoyable and with less hassle. They are constantly working on there products to improve them month after month and year after year not to mention providing updates to there consumers all the time. Saying that; this new XBOX rocks. Its load times are great its looks are sharp its graphics are like eye candy its WEIGHT is maybe a pound or two lighter then first ones. Its cool to the touch after playing about 5 hours straight and the most important fact to me its WHISPER QUIET... the 2 controllers are nice, its sucks no transfer cable or hdmi but at the price i really cant blame them.  I was one of the fortunate ones to have a problem free 20gb xbox since day one. Now i got this and i just love it. Picked up and extra warranty to for peace of mind for 37 dollars. And i plan on enjoying this system for at least the next 5 more years if i dosent end being part of my collection for life. Overall well worth the money if your interested in buying comes with the newest tech Microsoft has to offer and if may say it was between this and a ps3 never owned a ps3 and wanted one but as soon as i saw this i new it was going to be a very special XBOX and it is.  I will get a ps3 one day but not for a very long time...........Amazon is the best place to get this, and thank-you Microsoft for giving us yet another toy that is for a lack of words awesome in a time that everyone could use a litte happiness.

Great Deal
The value for everything included in this package is amazing.  I am not a fan of special artwork on consoles but this was moderately done and looks good and not flashy.  The 250GB hard-drive is awesome for media and DLC.  For anyone new to Xbox 360, it is an amazing deal; to current Xbox 360 users, it probably isn't worth buying unless you just need more hard-drive space, another controller, and want the game and can sell yours for a good price.  Overall, amazing deal, functions great, I think Modern Warfare 2 is a very fun game, I can understand the mixed reviews people give it, but I like it.  Even if you don't want Modern Warfare 2, this is the best Xbox 360 to buy.

Good Deal
What else can you say? Over the Elite it comes with a 250 GB hard drive, extra controller, and the COD MW2 game. If you're going to get the game and an Elite then just get this.

Great deal
I would like to start off by saying that I have owned a 360 from launch.  Overall this is a great deal.<br /><br />Comes with <br />- 2 Black wireless controls<br />- 250gb Hard drive<br />- Black mic<br />- special edition console <br />- power brick<br />- Regular red/white/yellow audio video cables (NO R/G/B)<br />- ethernet cable<br />- Modern Warfare 2 game<br /><br />***DOES NOT COME WITH<br /><br />HDMI cable - not a big deal since you can grab one online for less than $8 with shipping. I was a little surprised seeing that the last 2 elites I bought had the cable included.<br /><br />HDMI AV Cable<br /><br /><br /><br />Overall as a package it is a pretty good deal. You get a HUGE 250 gig hard drive, I believe it ends up being around 228gb of free space when you turn on your system. You get 2 controls instead of the usual 1, which is great if you have buddies or family to play with (don't hog all the fun!). On top of that you get Modern Warfare 2 which is a great game. I love the console as a whole it runs almost silent and very cool. It also looks awesome.<br /><br /><br />There is one thing i disliked about the deal though. That is it doesn't come with any HD video cables out of the box. Then it doesn't have the cable for HD audio (optical) in the box either. This wasn't a problem for me because I still had a pair of both these cables from another elite system I bought in the past. However, if i was a first time buyer  might have been a little ticked that I basically have to buy a $50 cable package (Microsoft sells both their brand hdmi cable and the audio cable you would need in a package together for $50 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UODATY">Xbox 360 HDMI AV Cable</a> ). <br /><br /><br />Overall I am VERY pleased with my purchase and plan to be for a long time to come.<br /><br /><br />Just a side note about xbox live I'm not sure that a lot of people know. When you buy a new system you get to create a gamer tag, most people assume you have to pay whatever the fee is to try xbox live out and play online. However when you create the gamer tag sign up for the silver membership. At the end of the process it will give you the option to upgrade to gold for 1 month for free. You can do this around 3 times i believe per system. Hope this helps a few people out that want to try out xbl for free.<br /><br />You wont regret buying this!<br />

Modern Warefare 2 Xbox360 Combo
Wow. I knew I was getting a deal when you consider that an extra controller and the new game was worth the extra money spent on the combo. All that and then the 250gb drive, is like a very nice extra. I used up all my 20gb original xbox with just a few demo's. Anyway the game was short but I knew that going into it and loved every minute. the console is sharp and I prefer to lay the system down and not vertical, as I have had bad issues with that angle. The new version of this console is a lot more quite than the one's before. guess they have fixed the cooling issue with out more fans to cover it up and just plane fixed it. I have been having a blast with this one.. If you have an old one or need a new one get this.. its a great deal.!!!

Xbox 360 - has circular scratch problem
We bought the Xbox 360 Modern Warfare 2 Limited Edition Console, the unit came with all needed accessories and has performed excellent except for the well known problem of circular scrathes that dstroys the game disk. We had this problem and had to learn the truth from a game manufacturer, not MicroSoft. Throughout this ongoing ordeal, Amazon customer service has been "outsatnding".

Good system, somewhat tacky graphics
Let me start off this review by saying that I own all three current-gen systems (although this review will not be comparing them). Prior to purchasing this 360, I owned a falcon Elite (which I purchased for the HDMI and 120GB HDD), and prior to that, I owned a xenon Premium (which I sold due to its lack of an HDMI port). All of the MW2 360s are the new jasper chipset, which for the consumer essentially means that the 360 is quieter, runs cooler, and uses less energy (150w max vs 175w for falcon, and 203w for xenon/zepyher).<br /><br />So how is the MW2 360? Well it's a better 360 than older ones, comes with more storage, and if you like what the 360 offers, then you will like this console more than the other 360 variants. If you don't like the 360, then the 360 page on Amazon is probably not the place for you. So to not drag on, here are some pros and cons of this specific bundle as compared to other 360 bundles:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+250GB Hard Drive<br />+Extra Controller<br />+Free Modern Warfare 2 Game<br />+Smaller Power Supply (about 2/3-3/4 size of original PSU)<br />+Black Bezel (personal preference, I prefer black over chrome)<br />+Jasper chipset<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Looks like someone spilled gray paint on console. (High speed, low drag? Joint Task Force? Seriously?)<br />-Doesn't come with HDMI cable or HDAV cable like previous Elite consoles. Has only a composite cable, which is pathetic; oddly no current-gen systems come with anything better than a composite cable.<br />-Audio adapter (with HDMI cable) is a $50 separate purchase. HDMI cables are cheap on Monoprice (and video quality is equal for all digital cables), but the audio adapter if you need to output the audio not via HDMI is a proprietary Microsoft cable.<br /><br />Despite these cons, this bundle is still worth getting (and is the best value in comparison to other 360 bundles) if you're looking to buy an Xbox 360 console.

Simply Awesome: "Dis Thing is Da Bomb!"
I'm an old "wood and steel" pinball guy and could never stand "video" games.  However, I bought this XBOX combo as an Xmas gift exchange with a relative.  Because of the "high price" of the mystery gift, my relative opted to not consummate the gift exchange.  BIG MISTAKE!!  I kept the XBOX combo and set it up on my A/V system.  From the very beginning, I was impressed with the extreme quality of the gaming console, wireless hand-held controllers, and their electronics.  Set-up was a snap (much less complicated than I had expected), and I am impressed with the speed of the wireless communications between the controllers and the gaming console.  I like the 250 GB storage on this Limited Edition Console, I now use it also as a "data vault" for archiving and playing back multi-media on my wireless network.  The game that is bundled with the Limited Edition Console, Modern Warfare 2, just blew me away with its realism.  I am one of the few licensed to actually own and use the real-deal machineguns, submachine guns, and destructive devices depicted in this game.  Also, to gain my firearms certification and training, for law enforcement, I was detailed to the U.S. Marine Corps in the 1990s.  I have to say that it is almost surreal how life-like and accurate the Modern Warfare 2 experience is to "live-fire" weapons practice and many aspects of actual weapons training for military and LE.  I was so mesmerized by the realism of the Hogan's Alley training scenario, and the combat missions, that I began wondering if Infinity Ward (the software developer) had actually developed it originally as a military / LE training simulator -- it is that good.  The "first person" perspective on weapons handling and situational judgement is outstanding.  I highly recommend this XBOX 360 Modern Warfare 2 Limited Edition bundle.  The product quality and performance is supreme, and well worth the price.  For action movie enthusiasts, this is even better than a motion picture ... it is like being IN the movie, and being in a movie with a million different possible outcomes based on the actions you make and the decisions you choose.  It is an ultimate "virtual reality" experience.  The vibrations in the hand-held controller when you load / charge / fire weapons adds nicely to the sensory experience.  I can't believe this ... the XBOX 360 Modern Warfare Limited Edition is transforming me into a gaming geek / nerd and I don't care!!!  I've always been a Sun Microsystems "big iron" enthusiast, but when I experience the quality and extensibility of the Microsoft offering in their XBOX 360 (in regard to what software developers like Infinity Ward can do on the XBOX operating platform), I understand why Microsoft is "king" to the popular masses.

A must have for MW fans
I purchased this for my 9 year old to replace his Halo 3 limited edition console which was running out of space since it had a 20gb harddrive. I do like the black color compared to the Halo 3 edition but it's kinda cool. I must say that the hard drive on this makes up for anything that is "missing" or "should have been put into it". With a 250gb hard drive you can play for a very long time without worrying about how soon you'll need to buy a new HD. Our only disappointment was that it didn't come with a HDMI cable and a few other Modern Warfare perks like maybe a free theme etc. It does come with 2 controllers so there's no need to buy another and a free copy of the modern warfare 2 game. My son is happy with his console so I'm happy.

Great Console, Great price
For existing xbox 360 owners, it's probably not worthwhile to upgrade.<br /><br />For new owners, this is a slam dunk. Console + 250Gb of HD + two controllers + headset + Modern Warfare 2... easy decision.<br /><br />The colour scheme on the console is very well done... blends in well with the other dark equipment in my rack.<br /><br />The game itself is awesome. Great playability, sound, graphics. Haven't done 2 play co-op yet, but looking forward to that.<br /><br />Fan noise is relatively good, esp if you transfer the game to the HD.<br /><br />All in all a great buy.

Best xbox deal ever!
Anyone who loves 360 or call of duty modern warfare should pick this up, if you can afford it and want rid of your own system its even worth it to trade in your old system get some store credit, and just get it. The system itself looks killer, with some different military syle grey writing on it, and around the power switch. Two black controlers, MW2 game, and basically a free 250gig hard drive!! Why do i say free? Well. Your getting a controller, which is around 50 bucks new, and the game which is 63 bucks with tax, so that takes you to about 400+ dollars, which is the price of the system. So yeah, the hard drives worth, when or if they decide to sell is separately would probably be around 200 or 250 bucks i'd bet, so you basically arent paying a dime for it:) Its the same ole good xbox just fancyed up with a cool look and the extra contents. But the hard drive for you hard core arcade, movie, demo and games on demand fans is definitely the biggest selling point of this system. Go out and get the elite with the 120gb drive plus the game, and controller, and your talking the same price or more, with a smaller hard drive, not nearly as good a deal. So if you have the money, better get this one, because once its gone, its gone for good. Rumors says about 2 more weeks, then done, the overstock might go online, but stores will not carry them. Also there is no guarantee yet that they will release the 250gb drive. So jump on this killer deal while you can. Also MW2 is great on 360, i had it for my PS3 and traded it in, looked awful, and the online was pathetic. The graphics on the xbox are as usual, crisp, colorful, great detailing, and probably pretty close to 1080p i would say, considering thats the output of my LCD, unfortunately you really can't tell with console games, wish they would read out the actually resolution they are putting out. Oh well. This is just a killer deal, so don't pass it up, it won't return.

Fantastic deal
I really don't have to talk much about how great this deal is with all the extra that it comes with.  So it's basically an Elite console with a special MW2 graphic art on its shell.  I really don't care about the graphic detail as much as the savings I get with this deal, but I'm not gonna complain about it, since it makes my unit distinct with the rest of the elite.  Anyway, a couple of things I'd like customers in the market for a new console to know is that this thing has the shorter power brick, which was said to be an indication of the newer chipset, plus I also found out that it supports 1080p when I went to configure it with my HDTV.  Now, I know that there has been some bashing about the Xbox's 1080p mode to be a non-true HD in the Amazon.com forums.  Whether that's true or not, I just wanted to say that this thing has that 1080p configuration settings option, for the benefit of those who wanted clarification on that.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.

MW2 Bundle, worth the money!
Pros:<br /><br />- sick Modern Warfare 2 Limited Edition Xbox 360<br />- MW2 (standard edition) <br />- 2 matching controllers<br />- Matching Xbox live headset<br />- Smaller power block, for easier mobility<br />- Massive 250gb Hard Drive<br />- More silent than the standard Xbox 360 Pro<br />- Newest Jasper Hardware Chip, making this system swing with the fastest and more up-to-date 360's<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- No HDMI cable<br />- Tiny 12 ft. Ethernet Cable (Not a big deal for me, but if you're not right next to a Ethernet port, then this cable is not for you)<br />- Standard MW2 Edition, and not Hardened (Based on personal opinion, but I was disappointed that this bundle came with the standard edition MW2 instead of Hardened with this package... still a great deal)<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Concerning the 250gb hard drive:<br />Some advice if you're upgrading hard drives, if you ONLY care about game saves, and Marketplace content (like i did)... then DO NOT purchase the hard drive transfer kit from Microsoft. Instead just buy a 512mb memory card and transfer the data over. When you use the transfer kit, it gives you a warning that all game saves and market content will be deleted upon transfer (I had over 512mb worth of game saves alone, so this would have never worked out). I'll give you a few steps on how maybe to help you do this without messing everything up.<br /><br />NOTE: you DO NOT have to move over Marketplace Downloads, I'll explain on how to do that as well<br /><br />1) Insert your 512mb memory card and your original hard drive<br />2) Go to My Xbox, then go to the very end to System Settings, select memory, select hard drive, then begin to move over your chosen data<br />3) Move your gamer tag with all the data saves that you want to your 512mb memory card (It's important that you leave your gamer tag on your memory card, until it's the very last thing to move, because you need your gamer tag to access content from your old hard drive)<br />4) Move your the game saves over to your memory card<br />5) Be sure to TURN OFF your xbox 360 console before switching hard drives<br />6) Turn your xbox 360 on, and begin to move over the game saves from memory card to new hard drive<br />7) Repeat steps 4 - 6, until you get every game save you need<br /><br />In order to get your marketplace downloads back, then just go to this website from Microsoft and it gives you easy steps on how to do it: [...]<br /><br />By doing so, you can re-download all your marketplace content with no hassle (:<br />---------------------------<br /><br />In comparison to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LBGB1S">Xbox 360 Elite Winter 2009 Lego Batman / Pure Bundle</a>:<br />- Only get 1 game instead of 2 (Holiday Elite bundle comes with 2 mediocre games, that's more kid oriented)<br />- 250gb hard drive (over twice the size of the holiday bundle's 120gb hard drive)<br />- 1 more matching controller than what the holiday bundle offers<br />- A Limited Edition MW2 Elite console<br /><br />For just 100 extra dollars you get:<br />- 1 more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OYITQO">Xbox 360 Wireless Controller Black</a>, 37.96 <br />- Best first person shooter of the year, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269QLI8">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a> (39.99, compared to the combined price of the holiday package games, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZKBJY6">LEGO Batman</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016NM7BU">Pure</a> 38.97)<br />- twice as big hard drive, 250gb (I'm guessing 75 extra)<br />- a limited edition elite console instead of a basic elite (in my eyes is more valuable, 25 extra)<br />--------<br />total: 138.98<br /><br />You save 38.98<br /><br />All-in-all this bundle is well worth the buy, and I highly recommend it to any 1st person shooter fan who is in need of an xbox upgrade.<br /><br />Happy Holidays, Hope this helped (:

A must have for the elite
What can I say this is a must have for any collector plain and simple.... Although this is my 4th system( no not to RROD) this the best one to get out of all of the bundles. I've had the halo 3 edition until it got stolen along with my arcade version bought an ferbish one then bought an elite but when this came out I've return my elite to walmart for this one like I said a must have the elite gamers.....

Awesome, period.
I bought this system when MW2 came out.  I hadn't owned a real gaming system (I have a Wii) since the PS2.  This thing kicks all sorts of tail.  HUGE amounts of hard drive space, games play insanely crisp with HD cable into my Vizio, Netflix through this system is outstanding.  Only issue I've had so far was one controller intermittently disconnected for about a month and the headset that came with it sucked.  That won't take away any stars though.  The controllers last forever on regular batteries and even longer with the play and charge kit.  I like that the console as a unique look from the other systems too.  <br /><br />Highly recommeded if they are still available.

Great unit, Great Price
This is a must have with your 360 and a controller.  And in black to match your Elite controllers.<br /><br />You can plug it in via USB to your Xbox 360 and charge the included battery pack while you play your game.  <br /><br />You can also remove your battery pack, and plug the cable directly to your 360 for wired gaming (so your controller won't shut off while you are in the middle of that hired driver Forza race.<br /><br />This charges via any USB port on your 360, your computer, your cable box, or your dog (if he has included USB hub).<br /><br />I recommend buying one of these, then buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYF88G">Quick Charge Kit</a>.  Then you'll have 2 battery packs, the quick charge dock, and a USB charge cable.<br /><br />

priced reasonably, flawless, black
works. the battery lasts forever. charger recharges. price is right. half the price of the quick charge kit, only a few dollars more than 1 battery. includes a battery and allows you to play in case the battery runs dead.

Good idea for hardcore gamers
I recently got the Xbox 360 elite, and knowing that I was going to be spending hours on it, I knew that some battery power was a necessity. I saw this, that comes with a battery and a cable - and at the price, I really couldn't say no. I was already going to get some rechargeable batteries for my controllers, and the fact that this is just a few more dollars with a battery, its definitely a good idea. <br /><br />It does take a while to charge, though, and that's obviously because you are using the battery power while it is trying to replace it, but thats not a huge issue unless your gaming spot is usually not readily accessible with a cord attached to your controller. I like my wireless gaming area, so I decided to also buy the Quick Charge kit for 29.99, which also includes a battery. This way, I've got 2 batteries, one in the charger and one in the controller, and have the Play & Charge cord ready if I have a friend come over to play some Halo 3 or something with me and one of us starts to get drained on battery power. Good investment!

Charge and Play
The xbox 360 has been out long enough for us to know that a charge and play kit is the best way to go to avoid spendling endless amounts of money on batteries.  With the new Xbox 360 Halo 3 Controllers and the Xbox 360 Elite out on the market, it was a good idea to sell matching Black Charge and Play kits, since I am rather particular that everything matches, otherwise, ifyou don't care you can still use the white charge kit on the black controller and stillhave it work the same.<br /><br />Excellent Purchase!!!

A must have
This charger kit is nearly essential.  Regular AA batteries will last longer but replacement can become expensive, and ruin your game if they die in the middle of it, especially if you're playing online.  The cord is long enough for most living rooms, and you can play and recharge the controller your using at the same time.  This kit does recharge your controller when the Xbox is turned off, but you have to go into your settings menu on the Xbox, under the downloads section and turn on the option to finish downloading content even when the machine is turned off.  For some reason this option also governs controller charging.

Xbox 360 play and charge kit
Works great, battery stays charged for many hours.  No hassle of down time with other charge station type battery systems; if the battery starts getting low you simply plug the controller in and keep playing.  (Get that vintage wired gaming experience again).  This is my second play and charge kit (purchased for second controller), and both it and the first kit have held up very well.  After over a year of ownership, I have noticed no drop off in performance/battery life.  Excellent product.

Xbox 360 Play & Charge kit
This is worth the price you pay here at Amazon.<br />The length you get out of the battery will vary from person to person and how they use it, how often etc etc.<br />I would like to comment on some other things that you may find helpful in your decision to purchase this.<br /><br />I have seen the batteries alone selling for roughly [...] so really this price here is a fair deal.<br /><br />If your wondering how long the cord is, it is about 111 inches just a slight bit over 9 feet long from end to end.<br /><br />You can have it plugged in while using the controller.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is to not connect the charge cable if the battery pack is not installed first. You need to have the chargeable pack installed first or the Double A pack installed. If you don't you can damage your controller!<br /><br />A few other notes to consider:<br />The charge time can take as long as 6 hours.<br />If you have not used the battery for 2-3 months it may take up to 3-5 full charges before the battery will reach its full potential again.<br /><br /><br />Happy Gaming!<br />

A "Must have" for 360 owners
I was having problems with my wireless controllers shutting off during games.  After some troubleshooting, I found out that it was the AA batteries losing connection.  When I bumped or shook the controller, it would turn off.  Even the lightest tap from my ring would turn it off.  My temporary solution to this was to remove the battery cover and then pull the springs up more so they would hold the batteries in tighter.  This worked for a while, but now that doesn't seem to be doing the trick anymore.<br /><br />My new solution was to buy the play & charge kit.  Problem solved!  The rechargeable battery packs don't use the AA battery springs so now I can tap and shake the controller as much as I want and it stays on.  No more frustration controller disconnects for me.  I'm going to buy the rechargeable batteries for all three of my controllers.<br /><br />The only downside that I've seen so far is that the battery life isn't as long as two AA's.  But it's really not much of a downside because it's so easy to just plug in the cable and let it charge while you play.  Your Xbox will even finish charging the battery after you turn the 360 off so it'll be at full charge the next time you play.  Very cool!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product and a must have for any Xbox 360 owner.<br />

Charged and Ready For Action!
This is a must-have for any serious Xbox 360 owner. Not only will you save money on batteries and help the environment, but the convenience is undoubtedly worth it.  <br /><br />The battery pack fits snugly and securely into the back of the controller where the regular batteries would go. You can play for dozens of hours without needing to recharge, but when your controller is finally on its last legs you simply plug the charge side of the cord (which fits into any of the 360's USB ports) into the top slit on the controller. You're able to play while the batteries recharge, and the cord is long enough to allow you to sit a fair distance away. While charging, there is a light on the cord top to indicate the batteries' status; red means to leave it in for a while, and green means you're good to go! <br /><br />This is the black-colored version of the Play & Charge Kit. It comes with both the charging cord and the battery pack. There is a white version to match the more common white controller, but the color of the charge kit is simply for aesthetics; they're interchangeable for either controller. I have the regular white controller and am using the black version with it, though surprisingly it still looks nice with the 360 controller's white and gray theme.<br /><br />Bottom line: Perfect product. 5 stars. Get it if you don't already have it.

Does the job and well.
I did the rechargeable battery route, but as it were, we ended up accidentally throwing away the batteries! What a stupid waste. So in comes the play and charge.  So far, so good. I know that other people have had some complaints regarding the longevity of these battery packs, but so far, they're great and has really saved me the hassle of messing with batteries.<br /><br />

A must for any 360 owner
This is one of those items which every 360 owner should own.  The battery life after a full charge lasts quite a while (maybe 6+ hours of game play).  There's really not much else to say about this item since it does what it's made to do.  My only gripe with this is that this option should have been included in the first place.  Although I can understand the need of having to buy a new play and charge kit after the battery can no longer hold a long enough charge.

Saves You $$$$$
Buy this product if you are tired of constantly replacing the batteries for your wireless Xbox 360 remote. I can't count the amout of money I've saved in purchasing this. Plus it comes with a cord that you can plug into the remote which charges the battery while you play.... so bonus.

Excellent idea, you never will wait for charger your battery again
Excellent product the best idea ever, you can play while the control it charging and the cable is long enough

Perfect for Gamer
This is perfect for a gamer who is always playing.  Recharge as you play, or plug into any USB port and charge the battery, even if you're system is off.  I plug mine into my FIOS CableBox.  It's always plugged in, so I can charge it when my X-Box 360 is off.  Lasts for hours of playing. Great escape from 2AA batteries, especially when you're in the middle of a great round of Halo or Battlefield Bad Company 2.

Cheaper Than The Battery Alone
I didn't even want the play and charge cord but it's cheaper than purchasing the battery by itself.  You can always throw out the cord, a little wasteful but I guess that's how microsoft prefers to operate.

Great quality, great price
Good play and charge kits are hard to find online, more often than not you get a 3rd party knock off, amazon is really good for this, they keep it quality, and they keep it reasonably priced. Great product.

Very handy to have.
The Play & Charge kit is very useful for both casual and "hardcore" gamers, as you can play without the battery pack connected and just attached to the cord, or with the rechargeable (even while playing) pack connected to the controller. You can in effect, use 2 controllers at once like this without running through AA batteries, and the charge cord is long enough to allow good movement and distance from the Xbox 360.<br /><br />Also if the controller is plugged in, it won't shut off even when idle, so if you're watching a video, you don't have to turn on the controller to rewind, pause, or otherwise control your video.<br /><br />The cost is very reasonable, especially considering the cost you save in batteries after just a few charges. The pack life seems only slightly shorter than a full charged alkaline battery to full-dead and is definitely adequate. NiMH batteries have, in my experience, excellent charge capacity and are typically very forgiving about developing a memory. Definitely recommend purchasing, great for charging as you play.<br /><br />I do recommend unplugging the cord when you power off the Xbox 360, as sometimes the fans will continue to run, and doesn't appear to be charging the batteries while off.

Comprehensive Review
I've divided the following review into sections, based on the type of gameplay from Modern Warfare 2:<br /><br />Single-Player Campaign:<br />Pros:<br />1) Action: The single-player campaign from Modern Warfare 2 is one of the most intense, white-knuckle, action-packed campaigns of any video game I have played EVER. The story is relatively good, and, except for one or two points (mentioned in cons), flows reasonably well. The missions themselves are adventures that will blow your mind. I don't want to spoil anything for prospective players, but as seen in the multiple trailers that preceded the game itself, snowmobiles, silenced snipers, heartbeat sensors, and steering television-guided missiles are among the many amazing things that come in this package. I have played the entire campaign through twice since the game's release midnight on Tuesday, November 10, 2009 - the first time on regular difficulty and a second time on veteran difficulty - and it definitely did not get old in between. Imagine a blockbuster action cinematic - but you're the hero.<br /><br />2) Challenge: The single-player campaign from Modern Warfare 2 is very challenging, more so than that from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Some might see this as a con, but I deem it otherwise. I would say that playing the campaign on regular is approximately equivalent to playing COD4's campaign on hardened. Regular to hardened represents a reasonable level of difficulty; veteran, however (and speaking from experience for the entire campaign) is, at some points, nigh impossible, and I'm NOT exaggerating. On two or three missions there were certain points where I died probably about two dozen times before managing to fight past the enemies or figure out a way to evade them. This, however frustrating, makes for all-the-greater amount of satisfaction when you beat the level, though.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Storyline: Although the storyline flows reasonably well for the most part, there are one or two crucial turning points in the campaign that, simply put, just don't make too much sense to me. This is kind of jarring to a player who places emphasis on believability and cohesiveness. However, the fun of the campaign is damaged only slightly by this.<br /><br />Campaign Overall Rankings:<br />Story: 3.5 stars<br />Action: 5 stars<br />Variety: 5 stars<br />Challenge: 5 stars<br />Replay Value: 4 stars<br />Overall: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Special Ops Missions:<br />Background Info:<br />The special ops missions are additional content missions that, for the most part, resemble campaign missions from either Modern Warfare 2's single-player campaign or, on occasion, from that of Call of Duty 4. You can play the missions solo or with a friend on split screen or over Xbox Live, etc. The ops are divided into 5 categories of difficulty, Alpha through Echo. You unlock the higher levels by earning certain amounts of "stars" in the spec-ops missions. For most missions, the number of stars you earn (1-3) depends on the difficulty of the mission that you set (Regular-Veteran). There are 69 possible stars total, which means there are 23 spec-ops missions. I have unlocked all levels through Delta so far, and each has 5 missions, which presumably means that Echo category has only 3, albeit they are surely very challenging. <br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Action: Spec-ops missions have several different determinants when determining how much action is in a given mission. Among these determinants are the mission type (more on that in just a second), difficulty, and playstyle. Some missions are definitely run-and-gun, others you will need to rely on stealth, and some the choice is really up to you. Personally, I like the ability to determine how to play a mission to some degree.<br /><br />2) Variety: The Modern Warfare 2 Spec-ops missions have a lot to offer in terms of different playstyles and objectives. Each mission is categorized based on how it plays in general. Examples of categories include stealth, wave defense, race, assault, and timed assault. The environments also vary a lot, just like that in the campaign, which many of the environments are based off of. So, if you love sniping Ultranationalist dog patrols in the snow, there's something for you; same story if you want to run-and-gun through a marketplace in Rio de Janeiro defusing bombs before the clock runs out. <br /><br />3) Challenge: Once again, Modern Warfare 2 comes up challenging, and once again I state this as a pro. Although there are slight variations based on the individual missions, the difficulty you set can make a huge difference. I have played through all of the Alpha and Bravo missions on veteran difficulty and the decisions a player makes, as well as how you work with your teammate in split-screen or online co-op, can make a huge difference. Players will also be forced to use good judgment, such as in the stealth missions when they decide whether they should engage or try to sneak past.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I really can't think of anything I would genuinely change about the Spec-ops mode. The only thing I can think of that frustrates me is that I definitely pay for my mistakes on the harder difficulties - but that's to be expected, right?<br /><br />Special Ops Overall Rankings:<br />Story: N/A<br />Action: 5 stars<br />Variety: 5 stars<br />Challenge: 5 stars<br />Replay Value: 4 stars<br />Overall: 5 stars<br /><br />Multiplayer:<br />Pros:<br />1) Maps: For the most part, the maps in Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer mode are very well-done. Most of them are larger than those in Call of Duty 4, although there are still some nice small ones like Rust that can be fun with as few as 2-6 people. The main thing I notice about the maps is the vast increase in dynamics. Nearly all the maps have many routes from point A to point B, whether that be across a street, along some back alleys, underneath in a tunnel, or over the rooftops. The environments themselves are quite interesting, and the graphics are, of course, exemplary. All the gametypes I have played (mainly Team Deathmatch, Sabotage, and Capture the Flag) work well in terms of where players start, where they spawn, and how they can approach the game. <br /><br />2) Equipment: The sheer amount of STUFF you can acquire in Modern Warfare 2's leveling-up system will blow your mind. While the number of weapons is increased about a third to a half again that of Call of Duty 4 - with additions of new firearms, some of which replace others that have been removed, as well as a number of new equipment and sidearm options - the number of ways to customize said weapons has at least doubled. Whereas in COD4 one could only put one of three equipment attachments on a given weapon (four if you count the grenade launcher, the others being silencer, red-dot sight, and ACOG scope), there are at least 6 for pretty much every gun in Modern Warfare 2. Examples of new attachments include the heartbeat sensor, extended magazines, full-metal jacketed bullets, underslung shotgun, and holographic sight. This variety provides tons of fun when unlocking new attachments by completing challenges and experimenting with different customizations. On top of this, with the bling perk, one can put two attachments on the same weapon, allowing even greater possibilities when building your loadout with the class customization tool.<br /><br />3) Other Variety: Some other aspects of multiplayer have also been expanded on in Modern Warfare 2 from Call of Duty 4. Some that bear particular mention include the killstreak bonuses, perks, and game modes. <br /><br />A) Killstreaks: Whereas in COD4 there were three killstreak bonuses (UAV radar, Airstrike, and Attack Helicopter, given at 3, 5, and 7 kill streaks respectively), there are 15 in Modern Warfare 2. Some examples of new ones are predator missile strike, stealth bomber run, AC130, EMP, and (the one that scares me the most) Tactical Nuke, the description for which simply says "End the game with a bang." However, you don't gain them all at once (that would turn games into ridiculous streak-fests). Instead, at certain levels you are able to unlock another killstreak bonus, having started out with UAV, a new bonus called Care Package, and Predator Missile strike. Once a player has more than three bonuses unlocked, the player can choose, at any time prior to any game, which three to have active. <br /><br />B) Perks: Perks, for those not familiar, are selected bonuses or abilities that a player selects as part of their class when playing multiplayer. There are several new perks in the game that confer interesting and useful, but not overpowered, abilities. Additionally, prolonged use of a perk now eventually allows the achievement and use of a "pro" version of the perk, that gives an additional bonus. A few examples of this are the Bling and Stopping Power perks. Bling "Pro" allows a player to extend the bonus of Bling (two attachments on primary weapon) to the player's secondary weapon or sidearm. Stopping Power "Pro" gives the player an additional damage bonus against vehicles. <br /><br />C) Game Modes: I am very happy that there are a few new game modes in Modern Warfare 2, particularly with the inclusion of an all-time favorite, Capture the Flag. Other new additions include a gametype called demolition and several traditional game types that are played in third-person mode, similar to Gears of War. <br /><br />4) Volume: Whereas Call of Duty 4 had 55 levels in any given progression, Modern Warfare 2 has 70. Add that to 14 different online playlists and 16 starting maps (and Activision has announced at least 2 DLC map packs will be on the way), there is a great deal of replay value in Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer. <br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Party Chat: It's in practically every review, I know, but I should include it anyways: most playlists in Modern Warfare 2 (all except Mercenary Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All, Ground War, 3rd Person Teams, and 3rd Person Cage Match) require you to be in game chat mode - no talking to friends who aren't in the game over a separate party. This isn't an extremely big problem in my opinion, but it can be slightly annoying, especially if there is someone else in the game who is being annoying. However, you always have the option of muting particular players. If you really wanted to, you could just mute everyone in the playlist except your friends, unless they're not playing with you. <br /><br />2) Particular Maps: This is a purely subjective con, but I'll throw it in here anyway. One or two (and only one or two) of the multiplayer maps are not very well built for gameplay, in my opinion. If you buy the game, I personally would advise trying to avoid Wasteland, but maybe that's just me. For the most part, nearly all the maps are quite fun.<br /><br />Neutral Comments:<br />This is a section where I'll mention just a few of the differences between Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2 that don't fall into pro or con in my opinion.<br /><br />1) Death: Simply put, you die easier in Modern Warfare 2. Whether this is a move to reflect realism, a "consequence" of more advanced firearms, or just a change Infinity Ward happened to make, it is a reality. It took me an hour or so to get used to it, but it's just part of the game, and it's the same for everybody playing. I don't think this is a positive or negative change.<br /><br />Multiplayer Overall Rankings:<br />Story: N/A<br />Action: 4.5 stars<br />Variety: 5 stars<br />Challenge: N/A (depends on other players)<br />Replay Value: 5 stars<br />Overall: 5 stars<br /><br />Total Game Overall Rankings:<br />Story: 3.5 stars<br />Action: 4.8 stars<br />Variety: 5 stars<br />Challenge: 5 stars<br />Replay Value: 4.3 stars<br />Overall: 4.8 stars<br /><br />Would I recommend this game to a friend?: YES

One of the best first-person shooters ever made.  Top 5 game of 2009
I have been playing Modern Wafare 2 non-stop since release, and I absolutely love it.  If you have any interest in shooters, this is the game for you.  The overall package is unlike any other game this year, and is hands-down one of the best FPS's ever made.  The graphics have improved significantly from the original, and I can tell Modern Warfare 2 was built from the ground-up.  It's a great deal on Amazon, with the credit of $10.  I received a $20 credit because I preordered.<br /><br />I will break this out into three categories:  Campaign, Spec-Ops, and Multiplayer<br /><br />Campaign:<br />The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 is similar in play style, length, and quality to the original Modern Warfare.  Infinity Ward has sacrificed overall length and storytelling to focus on fast-paced, white-knuckle action and suspense.  It is defeinitely worth playing for anyone that has Modern Warfare 2.<br /><br />Pros<br />+The action is great.  Their are tons of terrorists to kill, and plenty of realistic and fun military weapons and gear to use.  I thought it was a blast to play around with Predators, and order an APC to attack a certain area.  I really appreciate the time and effort Infinity Ward puts into the weapons and gear because I am a nerd for military video games, and I have actually seen many of the weapons in the game.<br /><br />+You visit plenty of real-world locations throughout the campaign.  This makes for a lot of diversity in the missions and environments.  Many shooters tack on repetitive hallways and areas just to say their games takes X hours to beat, but Infinity Ward obviously puts some tender loving care into their mission design.<br /><br />+A few notable missions in the campaign are some of the best I have ever played in any video game.  They are just stunning in the presentation.  I dont want to spoil them for players that havent experienced the campaing, so I will leave it at that.<br /><br />Cons<br />-The story of the campaign has plot holes all over the place.  By the time you finish the campaign, you wont have much of an idea as to what you have just done.  It seems like the scripting and plotline is measurably worse than the first Modern Warfare.  It is still the typical "hunt down and kill the bad guy" type story, but told with less cohesiveness.  It is almost as if Infinity Ward thought of a bunch of awesome missions for the player to experience, requiring him to travel all over the world to complete them, and then forced in this ridiculous and way over-the-top story to blend it all together.<br /><br />-I finished the campaign on hardened difficulty in 7 hours.  If you are a veteran of Call of Duty, I recommend you play on hardened your first time through.  This is a fairly short campaign, but with a lot of attention payed to details.  I dont think a short, but well done campaign is a bad thing.  However, the story is not great this time around and really leaves something to be desired in terms of to what context the player's actions should be framed.<br /><br />Spec-Ops<br />Spec-Ops is the cooperative segment of Modern Warfare 2.  It is a series of 23 missions, broken into groups of 5, that will remind you of the "Mile High Club" mission after the credits rolled in Modern Warfare 1.  You can play these split screen or online with one other person.  Spec-Ops are great fun when played cooperatively, and are a surprisingly good addition to a Call of Duty game.  I dont have many complaints about Spec-Ops<br /><br />Pros<br />+The missions are a lot of fun.  You can tell that some of these missions are ideas that Infinity Ward thought of for the campaign, but didnt quite fit in to what they wanted to do.  Their isnt necessarily a story in any of the Spec-Ops missions, they are just there for the challenge and fun.  Infinity Ward got pretty creative with some of these missions, like a mission in an AC-130.  Most of the missions are based on missions in Modern Warfare 2, and I've noticed a couple based on Modern Warfare 1.<br /><br />+Their is plenty of challenge and replayability to Spec-Ops.  Each mission has 3 difficulties corresponding to "stars".  1 star is regular, 2 is hardened, and 3 is veteran.  Almost every mission seems to be beatable on regular by yourself, but for some you're required to play with someone else.  I dont think anyone would be able to finish any of the Spec-Ops missions by themself on Veteran, except maybe some of the early ones.  This goes to show how much cooperation is required.<br /><br />Cons<br />-I would like to be able to play some of these missions with more than 2 total players.  How awesome would it be for you and 5 of your friends to be in several AC-130's, shooting terrorists and completing objectives?  Resistance 2 has 8-player cooperative missions, but they arent as exciting and creative as Modern Warfare 2's Spec-Ops.<br /><br />Multiplayer<br />Their is so much to say about Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer that I could write an entire separate review for it.  I think most people that buy Modern Warfare 2 are primarily looking for multiplayer, and their purchase will be justified.  If you liked the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 1, you will like it in the sequel.  Their can be up to 18 players in one game at a time, although this is only in the "Ground War" playlist that just has team deathmatch and domination (a capture points mode).  Most of the games are 12 player affairs, which I think is fitting for this game - This is not Battlefield, it's Call of Duty.  You earn experience for a variety of things like: kills, winning the game, assisting your teammates with a kill, completing general "challenges" or challenges pertaining specifically to a certain weapon, perk, or equipment, completing objectives like planting a bomb or capping a flag, etc.  As you can see, Infinity Ward has thought of a plethora of ways to reward the player for their accomplishments.  Your experience will accumulate, and you will "rank up" at certain intervals.  Each level will earn you new weapons, perks, equipment, and challenges that you can use and pursue while playing the multiplayer.  You can also customize your killstreaks now.  This means you can unlock and "equip" 3 killstreaks, and when you get that killstreak in a game you reap the rewards.  Finally, there are deathstreak rewards that work much like the killstreak rewards.  It can help a struggling player to get back into the game.  It is a blast to play with friends, and I highly recommend that you do.  Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer is some of the best I have ever played on a console, and I think most people will love it.<br /><br />Pros<br />+The progression of ranks will keep you addicted to Modern Warfare 2 for months, possibly for over a year.  Infinity Ward struck gold when they blended a first-person-shooter with great controls and an rpg-like progression system in Modern Warfare 1.  Modern Warfare 2 takes the relatively "safe" approach and keeps the formula mostly the same while expanding on it.<br /><br />+Infinity Ward has re-worked the perks and has added plenty of new weapons and attachments.  Their is much more to play around with now.  Each perk has a "pro" version that you unlock by completing challenges for the appropriate perk.  For example, you unlock Scavenger Pro by using the Scavenger perk and running over 150 dead bodies to resupply yourself.  The pro version gives you the same benefit as the base perk (resupply by running over corpses), and adds additional magazines for your primary and secondary weapons.  The pro perks are a great idea, and the new weapons are excellent.<br /><br />+There are 16 playlists currently.  This makes for a lot of diversity in the types of games you play.  I have not become the slightest bit bored of playing the multiplayer yet as there are so many different games to play.<br /><br />+Infinity Ward's map design is so great you will find yourself just staring at things in the environment.  Their is an incredible level of detail to each map - these are some of the most detailed boards I have ever seen in a game.  The maps are right up their, if not better than, those in Killzone 2, Battlefield: Bad Company, Halo 3, and any other popular shooter you can name.<br /><br />Cons<br />-XBOX Live has had it's problems with potty-mouth children playing mature-rated games online, and Modern Warfare 2 is a poster child for it.  You wont believe how young some of the players are, and the completely unacceptable and appalling language that comes out of their mouths.  Get used to: racial and sexual slurs, swearing, obnoxious sounds, singing, and voices; and teenagers calling each other "noobs", bragging about "owning"...you get the picture.  I dont know how a 13-yr.-old boy gets his hands on this game, but their are way too many kids online.  This is not necessarily a knock exclusively on Modern Warfare 2, but with millions of players online, you will know exactly what I am talking about in your first hour of the game.  This is a fair warning to brace yourself.  I suggest you find yourself some adult gamers, add them to your friends list, and play with them as often as possible.  Your Modern Warfare 2 experience will be INFINIT(el)Y better.<br /><br />Get it?  INFINITELY...Infinity Ward?...Get it?  Ok, nevermind...<br /><br />-You will get killed quickly and frequently if you spend all of your time on your own unless you like being a sniper.  This is another reason to do as I said above - find some other adult gamers and play with them.  You will have a better time socializing with friends, and working together to complete objectives like capping a flag.<br /><br />-Their seems to be more snipers in Modern Warfare 2 than in any other Call of Duty I have played.  And I have played all of them.  If you arent a sniper, it seems like you get killed much more frequently and easily, by enemies you cant even see.  I have more frequent deathstreaks now than I ever have, and it gets frustrating.  I am guessing the reason there are more snipers is the fact that killstreak rewards are enticing, and you die much less often when you are in the same window in a warehouse sniping the whole game.  I try to focus on playing game modes where you have to move around, like domination and headquarters.<br /><br />-I have a personal and subjective knock on the game:  the perk stopping power is still in.  Stopping power makes your bullets do more damage.  In my opinion it messes up the balance of the game because if you choose to use any other red perk, you will get killed by people with stopping power all the time.  90% of the time I die, and I see the player that killed me, he was using stopping power.  I am therefore forced to use stopping power to be competitive, which prevents myself and every other player from being able to use and enjoy the 5 other red perks.  If it takes me 4 more bullets to kill someone as it takes them to kill me, I am at a huge disadvantage and my kill/death ratio will detetiorate to an embarassing level.  I wish Infinity Ward would make stopping power a deathstreak reward like they did with juggernaut (extra health) and martyrdom (drop a grenade when you die).<br /><br />Thank for reading!

The best game ever.
Modern warfare 2 is the best game on the planet. Well maybe. The single player mode is very, very cool,realistic, and violent, just how I like it. The multi-player mode is at least 10 times better than it was before. I like how you can get a uav or a ac-130, helicopters, even a tactical nuke! The graphics for this game are so realistic and it feels like you're actully there. It's even better if you have a High-Definition tv.The story line is very great.It is good because it has modern day weapons and tech-gear. The only thing that makes me a little bit mad is that they dropped some of the weapons from the original modern warfare like the mp5,g3,r7000,m249 saw,and the g36c,but that's not a big deal. I like the new stuff you can do like breach a door and have a throwing knife. That's all I have to say.

Better for the average player than Modern Warfare 1
Love this game.  I have played all of the COD series since the beginning and hands down this is the best.  The single player is great, especially on veteran.  However, multiplayer is why you buy COD and here are my thoughts on that:<br /><br />Pros<br />-Great framerate and graphics combined<br />-Great variety of weapons<br />-Addicting leveling and achievement<br />-Many game modes<br />-New maps will be coming out regularily<br />-All your friends are playing it<br />-Spec Ops is great with a buddy<br /><br />Cons<br />-Still some cheating/glitching, the javelin glitch ruined the game for two weeks<br />-Pretty much no teamwork unless you play with friends or older players<br />-Takes away from your time with all the other great games that came out over the last few months<br /><br /><br />I would offer the following hints to the newer players or anyone who doesn't have the twitch reflexes of a 14 year old who plays for 8 hours a day.<br /><br />-Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch have simple rules but can also be frustrating to the non-elites who wonder why they spawn and die within seconds.  Try Domination or sabotoge where you don't always have to focus on "spray and pray."<br /><br />-Don't copy someone's loadout just because they are getting the most kills.  For example, my kill/death ratio is crappy, about .86.  However, my win/loss ration on Domination is much higher than 50/50 because I play to my strengths and think about teamwork first.  Because I am not able to beat most people gun to gun, I use the explosives perk and set mines around a captured flag and defend.  80% of players in this game will cap a flag and move on to the next one.  That works for some but not a person like me who sometimes even misses his mouth when eating.  I also equip the grenade launcher attachment which ensures I can defend and pop out and kill someone with one general vacinity shot instead of 10 shots to the body.<br /><br />-Using the defend strategy you can get killstreaks easier and supply drops will occasionally have some great items like an AC-130.  I was lucky to get a UAV in the original Modern Warfare.<br /><br />In summary, great game-buy now.<br />

It's like playing war as a kid - with all the best weapons!!!
Could not recommend a game more.  Amazing detail in every regard.  The game grows with you.  (I have logged well over 100 hours and am still loving it). <br /><br />Quick review of all three sections...<br /><br />Training/Challenges - "Special Ops" - section definitely helps hone the skills and learn the weapons.  AI is very challenging.<br /><br />Career - fun story line - great play and graphics. You'll want to finish all three levels (unlike many other similar games).  Again, AI is very challenging.<br /><br />Live - clearly the most fun.  I play the "team deathmatch" - you increase your rank throughout the process and play with "like" players.  5-10 minute challenges that play 6 on 6.  It literally is likely playing war as a kid with all the real strategy, thought and action required to do well - let your imagination run wild and it still wont describe how detailed and fun this is.  I have not played the other challenges as I am addicted to deathmatch express.

More to Love!
Who thought that you could improve on one of the best selling fps games ever? The maps and weapons are beautifully detailed, infinity ward has outdone themselves. While single player was a bit of a disappointment, multi player was vastly improved. There are so many new guns, attachments, equipment, and perks to make pro. To all considering it, BUY IT! Without a doubt the best fps shooter at the moment. I can't wait for MW3! However, Treyarch has been a disappointment to the call of duty name. Infinity ward should be given full rites.

What We Were Hoping For
CODMW:2 may very well be the best game of 2009.  In a world where sequels often fail to live up to expectations, MW2 is certainly an exception.  I gave this game five stars because its awesome and I think everybody should buy it.  There are a TON of cool features added into this game, though I do have a couple of concerns that I'll share as well.<br /><br />Campaign - The storyline for MW2 is amazing for a couple of different reasons.  Not only is the plot really exciting; the storyline is both realistic and believable.  A large number of locales are explored - from the arctic, to the desert, to our nation's capital.  It really gives you the sense that what occurs in one area of the world can have great ramifications elsewhere.  New vehicles and new weapons are introduced that really provide some epic gaming.  Though the campaign is definitely one to be remembered, I feel like it could have been better narrated.  I was really confused at a couple different points in the game, the end included.  One minute you're running the obstacle course at base camp and the next minute war has broke out on America's doorstep.  It would have been helpful if they threw in a couple shortish cutscenes throughout the game to help move the story along.  The short dialogues that the characters had whilst the next map loaded often left me wondering exactly what the mission at hand was.  I feel like we're at an age in gaming where somewhat of a cinematic experience is expected from big-time games, but on the other hand maybe that's just me.  I also felt like this game was REALLY hard.  I'm a pretty hardcore gamer and I found that playing just on hardened was way too difficult.  I suggested to my friend that he play regular as opposed to a more difficult setting and he mentioned that even on regular he died pretty regularly.  Maybe it has something to do with improved AI, but I definitely don't anticipate I'll give veteran a go anytime soon.  Though I'm of the opinion that COD4 had a much better storyline and campaign, the campaign in MW2 will definitely blow your socks off.<br /><br />Multiplayer - This is basically the same as COD4 with a couple of subtle changes.  They did give this one a bit more of an arcade-type feel to it.  It's really fast-paced and I feel like they are trying to discourage sniping just a bit.  Though I prefer the maps from COD4 by a great deal, I've had fun playing online and I wouldn't expect that to change for a very long time.<br /><br />Graphics - The graphics are the real deal - definitely top-notch as far as the 360 is concerned.  Environments look sweet and characters actually look like they could be real people, as opposed to those in Halo:ODST.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really sweet game.  I don't think it's as good as COD4, but that's because COD4 is undeniably one of the greatest games ever made.  MW2 is certainly a sequel worth the hype.  <br /><br />Another note - This game is rated 18+ for a reason.  There are gruesome scenes of death/disturbing images/themes that younger kids probably shouldn't be exposed to.  I'm not suggesting that it's inappropriate for everybody under 18, but if you are trying to determine whether this would be an appropriate game for younger kids then the answer is probably no.

Exceeded Expectations
Modern Warfare 2 has lived up to the hype. The game is a big improvement over COD4. The multiplayer is even more addictive than COD4. <br /><br />Positives:<br />- Maps (Quantity and Quality)<br />- Weapon Balance <br />- Killstreaks <br />- Weapon Diversity <br />- Weapon Attachments <br />- Lag free gameplay (for me anyway)<br />- Titles and Badges <br /><br />Negatives<br />- No Party Chat<br />- No statistical improvements<br />- No clan system <br />- Not enough hardcore gametypes <br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this game. I think a lot of the negative reviews are either people who want the game to be an exact copy of COD4, or PC players who ticked off about the lack of dedicated servers.

Multiplayer Extraordinaire
It seems kind of silly that people buy this game for the campaign mode alone. You should have figured out by now that this franchise is building off their multiplayer success.<br /><br />I'm only lvl 29 at the moment so keep that in mind.<br /><br />CONS: <br />- Party chat. Seriously? Sure could use a patch for this. I'm really tired of listening to little kids and drunk frat boys when I could be talking to my buddies.<br />- No co-op. It's worth mentioning. But, like I said, this isn't what the game is about, really.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Exceptional level building and layout. Although there are a couple stages that I don't particularly like, all the levels are designed well and provide for multiple game types. Every level is HUGE compared to MW's maps. Also, props to IF for making some destructible aspects, good interior building, and nasty little hideaways that are only reachable if you use your tactical insertion perk.<br />- Expanded perk system. All your favorite perks, but with an update and further upgradeable. Remember Extreme Conditioning? Yeah, well now it is called Marathon and allows you to sprint continuously. Not only that, but once you complete the challenge involved with it, it will upgrade and allow you to climb faster.<br />- Weapon customization. Yeah, you can dual wield machine pistols now. Instead of just pistols as secondary weapons you can have a variety of weapons to choose from of pistols, machine pistols, shotguns, and launchers. Great news for snipers(especially since you can put a silencer on a shotgun). Even the secondary weapons have challenges and upgrades.<br />- Equipment and attachment customization. Throwing knives. Blast shields for explosive damage resistance. Tactical Insertion, which allows you to spawn wherever you throw the flare. Grips, Grenade Launchers, Supressors, ACOGs, and Red Dot Sights return in MW2. Fortunately so do their big brothers. You can now upgrade to a shotgun attachment, a Thermal Scope(which looks like the "White Hot" scan when using the AC-130), Holographic Sight(think Red Dot Sight, only with a larger crosshair and increased accuracy), Heartbeat Sensor, Sniper Scope, Full Metal Jacket, Rapid Fire(replaces Double Tap),  and Akimbo(allows for dual wielding pistols and machine pistols).<br />- Killstreaks and Deathstreaks Rewards. You can now customize your kill streak rewards. They include everything you ever wanted from the original. You have your standard chopper as well as a fully armored version for a higher killstreak reward. You can even get inside the actual chopper and use the turret or use the AC-130 instead. At 15 kills you are awarded an EMP charge that knocks out your enemies electronics completely. Everything from your crosshairs, UAV, radios...everything. It sucks. At 25 kills you get to use a nuke. Yup. That's right. A nuclear bomb that drops on the map and kills all players, ending the game.<br /><br /><br />All-in-all, this is the best FPS multiplayer experience you can find. If you have even a little interested in FPS or competitive online gaming, you owe it to yourself to buy this game as soon as possible. It will likely be the most played FPS for years to come. At least until MW3 comes out.

Amazing improvement over a masterpiece!
I absolutely loved MW1 for the campaign and the multiplayer.  I preordered this game expecting it to be good, but was a little skeptical that it would be the same game repackaged with a little different storyline (after my ODST experience).  I purposefully avoided trailers and pre-release information so I could get an untainted opinion.<br /><br />Here is a quick summary:<br /><br />Campaign:  a little short, but was amazed at the cool things you get to do over the original, like the breaching and clearing, famous snowmobile scene, rapelling to secret attacks.  Even though it was short, it was truly well done and with the US being attacked added a intensity that was truly immersive.  The only mark against it is the terrorist level, as it is over the top, but they had the disclaimer for a reason.  A<br /><br />Multiplayer:  also impressed at the graphics improvements, fluidity of the play, pop-up scoring, and big step up in intensity and perks.  Since I usually get shot more than shooting, love the play balancing features that make the game more fun for people that have lives (who don't play it all the time... :) sorry, couldn't resist, just my excuse for being not so good).  Maps are a bit big but will help discourage camping which plagued the last two versions.  Be a man, get up a fight, as it's only a game!  :)  A+<br /><br />Spec Ops:  A real joy for those who like the classic coop features.  I love how it builds on the campaign, yet adds enough to make it more fun.  Just a lot of fun with friends.  A+<br /><br />Seriously, if you like shooters, this is a great game and must.  Bungie needs to take a lesson on how to do sequels from these guys.  Thanks for all of the hard work in order to take the game to the next level when they could have pulled a Bungie and repackaged the same game for $$.  Already looking forward to MW3 thanks to the neat cliff-hanger.  Thanks again Ininity!

Raising the bar?  Blowing it up, maybe...
Back in the fall of 2001, I didn't want to play the XBox.  I thought that Bill Gates was trying to monopolize my beloved pastime, the holy hobby of video games.  So I didn't play it, that is, until my friend made me play Halo in the Spring of 2002.<p>My mind was instantly changed.<p>Halo is not just another video game, it's more of an experience that on higher difficulty levels, you don't just play, you survive.  The story is well-planned and well-paced, the weapons are oh-so-cool, the digital surround sound helps to hear behind you (online challengers don't stand a chance), the music is stirring and epic, and the graphics are simply jaw-dropping.  Nothing I've played in the past year has put these essential components together quite like Bungie Studios has with Halo.  Single player missions are a blast, and you actually feel like you are a super-soldier fighting an alien menace on a strange artificial ring-world in the middle of who-knows-where.  But playing by yourself misses the thrill of this game completely.<p>Anyone with broadband access can use GameSpy Arcade, download the necessary components, cheaply purchase extra equipment, and go online to show the world what you are made of.  Multiplayer separates the kids from the adults more than any other console game I have EVER played.  To survive, you must be strategic, yet ruthless.  You must know the levels, know how to hide, know how to shoot accurately, and know how to move effectively.  Once you take some time to master these skills, you feel like you've accomplished something great...<p>Oh, and if you have friends with copies of Halo, use the biggest room you have to link up 4 XBoxes for 16-player deathmatches (the one catch, every 'Box has to have its own TV).  Trust me, nothing brings friends together like 8-on-8 Team Combat.  You run to the shotgun room to take care of the weapons cache, Friend #1 runs to the Rocket Launcher for heavy artillery, Friend #2 takes up a sniper position with Active Camouflage (think Predator), Friend #3 waits at the end of the bridge with Fragmentation Grenades, Friend #4 packs a Plasma Rifle to slow down enemies and destroy their shields, Friends #5 and #6 secure medical packs for the squad, while #7 and #8 go freelance and be bait/avengers.  And that's just an example of the Slayer mode, where the most kills wins.  You've got King of the Hill modes, Capture the Flag, Oddball (he/team that holds the ball for the longest amount of time wins), Races and more.  And it's not just mindless killing, all these modes require team strategy and underatanding of the playing field terrain.  The more you know about where you are, the better off you'll be when the scores are final.<p>The only way this can get any better is when Halo 2 comes out in 2003.  By then, XBox Live (Microsoft's online game service) will be up to full steam, and who knows what the future could hold (besides the super-cool headset microphones that let you talk to squad members)...<p>If you own an XBox and don't own this game, shame on you.  If you don't own a 'Box, buy one for THIS GAME.  You'll thank me later.

Great Game
I played Halo in a 16-person multiplayer capture the flag competition at one of Microsoft's "Xbox Unleashed" parties.  I also got to watch a decent player run through a few levels of the single player mode.  The biggest issue with any first person shooter on a console is control.  Honestly speaking, Halo's control is just not as good as the classic PC mouse and keyboard setup.  And yet, for first person shooters on a console, Halo's control is a breakthrough.  I, and many others around me, were surprised by how easy it was to adjust to Halo's control scheme.  Furthermore, it is highly customizable, you can even adjust the sensitivity of at least one joy stick.  I would not be surprised to see claims in the future that Halo's control is superior to the mouse keyboard combination.<p>Onto the graphics... Evil Empire or not, Microsoft delivered on the graphics in Halo.  Halo is a sunny world with bright blue skies complete with drifting clouds.  Jutting steel towers hiding vast underground complexes are set against a background of curved landscapes (another words, Halo's engine does curved surfaces and they are not afraid to show it off).  All the character models look and move organically and the vehicles, though somewhat derivative of Star Wars, are very cool.   I heard some complaints about frame rate from a guy on the losing team of our little competition, but I thought it played smoothly throughout. <p>Because of the noise at the party, I can't judge the audio, but I can tell you that the game would be worth it with no sound at all.  Halo is packed with features, including, I'm told, new multiplayer game types and all the networking software needed to make hooking up your Xbox to a LAN, or directly to a cable modem, a snap.  And last but not least, lets not forget that the fun factor is high, after all you even get to jump into vehicles and mow down everything in your path.  Basically, I am willing to go out on a limb and say Halo looks like it will live up to, and maybe exceed, all the hype.  Buy an Xbox so you can play this game.

This is THE launch title to own
All I can say is WOW!  Just got my Xbox from preorder this morning and spent most of the day playing Halo. There are so many great things about this game, I hardly know where to begin. <p>First off, even though this is a console FPS (First Person Shooter) the controls are absolute dynamite.  I have heard numerous criticisms of the Xbox controller and I can honestly say that I found it to be not only extremely comfortable but also amazingly precise.  This game doesn't make you wish for a keyboard and mouse which is the first console FPS I can really say that about.<p>Second the polish on this game is absolutely top notch.  The enemy AI is the best I have ever seen, the graphics are very detailed and smooth, and the game is just all around a blast to play.  The single player mode alone is great, but the real fun is the campaign with a buddy co-op mode.  My friend and I played this game for four hours straight together and we couldn't stop playing it was so much fun.  The difficulty level is just perfect; challenging but not at all frustrating and because the AI is so good it keeps you coming back since no two encounters are alike.<p>All in all I can't say enough good things about this game.  If you buy and Xbox (and you should) BUY this game.

HALO -SETS A NEW STANDARD FOR FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS
You are the ultimate commando - a cybernetically enhanced soldier representing the peak of human military evolution. You are efficient, skilled, and dangerous. A sci-fi shooter that takes place on a mysterious alien ring-world, Halo will have you battling through amazing indoor and outdoor environments, in vehicles, and on foot with the largest arsenal of futuristic weapons, vehicles, and combat roles of any shooter ever. Your situation: In a desperate attempt to keep a conquering alien race called the Covenant from finding Earth, you and a ragtag group of Marines flee to a distant uncharted system where you unexpectedly stumble across Halo, an enormous alien artifact in orbit between a gas giant and its moon. <br>Your objective: Uncover Halo's horrible secret, and destroy mankind's nemesis - the Covenant.<br>Here it is, the system seller. Halo lets you infiltrate enemy bases, either with computer AI or with a friend. And not only on foot, but you can also jump in and out of military vehicles on the fly with no load times or pauses. Add to that an incredibly atmospheric and dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, and you have a must buy war fps/vehicular combat game. <br>Its true that a keyboard and mouse is best for games like these, but if you get used to playing with a gamepad, you will find the game more fun. At first when I played Quake 3 on ps2, it was hard, but after I got used to the controlling, it was easy. Everything seems hard at first, but give it some time and practice and you will see results. If you still cant play with a gamepad then wait till they come out with a keyboard and mouse for xbox. If you seen the movies for this game, you know that its really not only the graphics that make this game good, its the real life physics, animation, sound, story, and A.I. that makes this game so good. <p>* Huge Weapon Variety - Vanquish your enemies with a vast array of Human or Covenant weaponry ranging from the stealthy (semi-automatic pistols and needler guns) to the fierce (rocket launchers and flame throwers). <p>* Vehicle and Foot-Based Action - Tackle missions anyway you choose - be it storming an enemy base or taking the wheel or gunnery position of a variety of powerful vehicles. Vehicles range from stolen Covenant flyers to Human buggies and more. <p>* Indoor and Outdoor Combat - Fight seamlessly in Halo's ultra-realistic indoor and outdoor environments as you hunt the Covenant in a variety of single player missions and multiplayer battles. <p>* Intense Multiplayer Shoot-outs - Form a team, choose a role, and fight cooperatively with your friends, battle it out Deathmatch style via intense split screen, LAN-play or fight co-op with a friend through the single player missions. <p>* Incredible Mission Variety - Fight the Covenant in a variety of missions as you uncover the dark secrets of halo. Among your many objectives - attack enemy outposts, raid underground labs for advanced technology, rescue fallen comrades, steal alien vehicles and weaponry and snipe enemy forces. <p>* Reality Bending Special Effects - Halo features the most advanced graphic system on the most advanced gaming platform in the world. Gunfire rips off the screen, explosions light up a living room, and environments blur the line between your couch and fantasy. <p>* Rich Sci-Fi Experience - Halo transports gamers into a science fiction universe fresh out of a Hollywood movie. With a detailed twisting story line, complex characters and cunning enemies, Halo will fulfill every sci-fi enthusiastis

May Be The Most Impressive Game Released To Date
Halo is one of the most graphically impressive games released in videogame history. The attention to detail is excellent. For instance, when using an assault rifle, you can see each clip as it is used. Incredible draw distances, outstanding cutscenes, and marvelous camera work contribute significantly. <p>In respect to audio, Halo outshines the competition. The sound effects are spectacular and the soundtrack is killer. In-game voice acting has never been so good. You can hear your allied marines chatter about the enemy, when they have been hit, where the enemy may be, etc etc. In addition, you can hear the frantic cries of the running enemy when you and your shotgun sneak up on them. Playing this game in Dolby Digital will give the gamer an unsurpassed gaming experience. <p>In actual gameplay, this is where Halo redefines first person shooters. No other console game has gone where Halo goes.  Halo is comprised of 10 well-designed, surprisingly large levels, mixing indoor and outdoor environments, to give the gamer an experience which will not soon be forgotten. And this is no normal shooter either. You can play campaign mode single player or with a friend. This is the first game to have a great "co-op" mode. If you can't beat a level, call a friend and work together. Playing the 'single-player' mode with a friend makes the game a far more enjoyable experience. <p>The developers of Halo knew what they were doing when they included vehicles in the game. Throughout the game, you will use a variety of vehicles to help you defeat the enemy. Some are slow but powerful tanks, while others are quick hovercraft. Several of the vehicles allow more than 1 player to get in, thus letting 1 person drive while the other blast the enemy away.<p>However, where Halo really shines is in its multiplayer. With 4 players, 2v2 deathmatches are just a blast. However, with a Cable or DSL connection you will be able to play Halo online! You can play with up to sixteen players in pure madness. Of all the time I spend playing Halo, 90% of it is online. It is just incredible. It takes everything positive about console gaming and pulls the online gaming from traditional PC games to make Halo one of the most enjoyable games ever made.<p>Should you buy Halo?  Absolutely! And don't worry about getting bored anytime soon. With friends and online play, you will be playing this one for months.

Gold Standard for FPS
A completely satisfying gaming experience.  The graphics, sound, cinematics, plot and missions are all outstanding.  The thing that puts this game way over the top is the AI.  You have to use some serious strategy to make it through most of the battles.  Smart enemies and sparse distribution of weapons, ammo, and power ups make it extremely challenging, but never overly frustrating.  One of the last levels involves a battle with you versus two enemy tanks (each with the ability to take you out with one shot), four cloaked elite aliens, and three dozen other aliens in a huge frozen gorge between two mountains.  Your strategy must be perfect.  It takes about twenty minutes of play before you can advance to the level's checkpoint.  You can't use the old "show yourself and all the enemies will line up and chase after you" deal.  I had to sneak around and pick off the tanks with the rocket launcher, throw grenades to the left and attack on the right.  Use an enemy hovercraft as a decoy and flank the turret gun....crazy stuff.  It took me a dozen tries before I got by.  Several of which I got down to the last line of defense and got killed by a stupid little grunt or killed myself with my own grenade during an ambush.  Usually these kind of levels tick me off (i.e. the train in Bond).  With this, I enjoyed it all. <p>Other things about the game that seemed annoying at first actually turned out to be very cool.  <p>1) No boss monsters.  The game is linear for the most part but each level ends usually ends with particularly challenging fight with either a ton of enemies or a few enemies in a very strategic position making it difficult to take them out.<p>2) Only seven different enemies.  There's two races of bad guys, each with 3 or 4 different soldiers.  Not a lot of variety, but more realistic.  Each type of enemy has its own detailed AI.  Example - One type charges you when they're out of ammo, the other runs away.<p>3) Weapons - First, you can only carry two at a time and there is virtually no ammo lying around.  If you are low, you gotta kill something and steal its gun.  Each weapon has different effects on each enemy.  The shotgun takes out a Flood Elite with one shot but has virtually no effect on a Covenant.  You need to have a solid strategy on which two guns to carry at any given point on a level.  Again, more realistic.  Unlike Bond where you can carry 5 or 6 weapons.  Second, there are only seven different weapons but the whole "which gun, when" thought process keeps it interesting.<p>4) Saving - You don't save just anywhere.  The levels are broken up into multiple checkpoints and the game saves after each checkpoint.  Not really annoying, just different.<p>5) Health - You have Shield and a Health meter.  The shield depletes first, then the health.  The cool thing is the shield regenerates after a few seconds if you aren't being hit.  So basically, when your shield gets low, hide and wait for it to regenerate.  Once the shield is gone, health drops quick.  The shield will regenerate, but health stays low until you find a health pack (sparse).  Not annoying, just different.<p>Other High Points<br>-A jeep with a huge Gatlin gun.  Two marines can ride with you, one in the gunner seat and one in the passenger seat.<br>-A tank with a Gatlin and missile launcher.  Four marines can ride along on top.<br>-A hovercraft with plasma cannons<br>- Mini-jet with plasma cannons and a plasma missile launcher.<br>-Cool death sequences.<br>-Melee attacks (pistol whipping, jamming the butt of rifle into the back of its neck, etc.)<br>-Sniper rifle with night vision.<br>-Motion tracker ala "Aliens"<br>-"Sticky" grenades<br>-Carcasses - When you kill something, the body will be there the rest of the game (no "fade away" ala Bond).  You can continue to smack it with your gun and spray blood everywhere.  If a grenade goes off nearby, all the carcasses fly in the air and land somewhere else.<p>Final thought:<br>You must try this game.

Best console First Person Shooter ever.
Being an avid PC First Person Shooter advocate of games such as Unreal Tournament, Halo for the Xbox was a gamble to me.  I had read numerous reviews, all saying it was nice.  It still bothered me, there was no keyboard and mouse, how could it be nice?  <p>Needless to say, I picked up the Xbox and Halo a day after it was realeased in the US.  I powered on the machine and threw in Halo.  To my dismay, the game was alright on a controller.  The learning curve was about thirty minutes to an hour for the control via the dual analog sticks, but after that, everything was smooth and precise.  <p>The game itself is a modern console masterpiece.  If you are a PC gamer, a console gamer, or both, pick up this game.  The story is nice, the control is nice, the graphics are overpowering, the soundtrack kicks in at just the right times.  Voice acting is also superb.  Alright, so it is nice, that doesn't mean it is a masterpiece.  Well, I am moving to that in a minute.  AI, artificial intelligence is where the game becomes a masterpiece.  AI on both sides, your marines, and the enemies (The Covenant and The Flood) are both amazing.  It never feels like you are battling ET, these are full fledged strategic beings with energy weapons.  They will strafe, hide behind obstacles, send out decoys, everything that you would do.<p>On a final note, Halo offers co-op mode.  A buddy and yourself can play throughout the entire story together.  To put it bluntly, this mode rocks!  The game is a five star by itself.  Then add a great co-op mode and the scale needs a few stars added to be able to keep up with Halo's gameplay

BEST Game Ever (like the Comic Book guy on The Simpsons...)
'Barnicles!! This game is Awesome!!! Halo is BY FAR THE BEST FPS (first person shooter) ever made!! If I could, I'd give this vid. game 6 out of five stars!! It's just that amazering!<p>But seriously, there are at least 20 great reasons that I can think of for you to buy this game. And here they are:<p>*Incredible game play and fun<br>*Gorgeous 3D environments and good character visuals<br>*Smarter AI (that's Artificial Intelligence, fer all'y'all   newbies) <br>*A little bit of humor thrown in. Every game needs it!<br>*Seemless adrenaline (sorry, don't know exactly how to spell it) inducing action<br>*Ingenius control schemes<br>*Ingaging storyline<br>*Cooperative Play on the Missions is available!!!<br>*Well worth the price value<br>*Fitting Sound track (music) <br>*Around 26 fun-filled multiplayer modes<br>*Up to SIXTEEN people can play with a system hook-up thingy<br>*Characters that ya love to love and love to hate<br>*4 fantastical drivable vehicles, including a flying one<br>*4 difficulty levels<p>*Changeable suit color for Master Chief (multiplayer only)<br>*Can be played on the Internet<br>*Incredibly funny end cut-seen for the Legendary mode<br>*Hours and hours and hours of gameplay<br>*Very high replay value<p>So if you have an Xbox or are thinking of getting one I encourage young and old alike to buy Halo. (The ESRB Rating System rates a few vid. games a bit too harshly. Just compare this Mature rated game to R rated movies and you'll see the difference). Take my word for it, you most likely won't even need to rent Halo first before buying it.

Outstanding, immersive, and very, very fun.
(...) Well, not only is Halo by far the best FPS for a console I've ever played, it's the best FPS I've EVER played, and one of the best GAMES, period. If this is what we can expect from the Xbox, well, thank God I have one, that's all I can say. <p>Typically, no shooter can compare with the holiest of holys, Half-Life. Half-Life has been the pinnacle of what the genere was capable of, and nothing could ever quite match it. <br>'Till now, anyway.<p>Halo rolls everything you could want in a shooter all into one package, save online play. You want immense outdoor environments? Here you go. Tons of weapons? Okay, we'll let you use the human weapons AND the alien weapons, how's that? Good AI? Try this. On the hardest difficulty level, the enemies will position sqauds on either side of any given hidey-hole you're cowering in, toss a good number of grenades to flush you out, and mow you down from two different directions when you make a run for it. Should you somehow live through that, they'll regroup, laying down cover fire, and try to split up and circle around you, leaving the tougher troops to face you head-to-head while the smaller guys gang up and shoot you in the back while the others have you engaged. <p>What else, you say? Well, okay. Every game like this has a gimmick. Half-Life had the fact that you could take guards and scientists with you. Red Faction had the fact that you could blow holes in walls. Halo? Ohhh. Let's count 'em.<p>For one thing, you have your Marines. They will fight WITH you, and they're no slouches. They react to the fight, think quickly, and will follow your lead but take the initiative if it presents itself. Flush an enemy out, and most often they're waiting to take it down. Need to snipe some enemies? They'll hold off until you're finished, and back you up if the enemies get too close. <p>Next, there's the enemies. Each enemy has a very different way of attacking, be it head-on, defensive, swarming, bait-and-attack tactics, whatever. The alien weapons are actually no better than the human ones, but sometimes are preferrable given certain situations.<p>Then we have the plot. While it's a little simple and contrived early on, there are major plot twists down the pipe. When you finally find out what Halo actually is, not to mention who really lives there, you'll be impressed by the scope of the story to say the least. It's Sci-Fi, but it's good Sci-Fi. <p>Lastly, and easily the best, we have vehicles. LOTS of vehicles. Get in the Marine Warthog jeep and a Marine will jump in back, manning the cannon. If he gets taken out, you can jump in the back  yourself and use the gun. If a friend is playing with you, have HIM drive while you shoot, or vice versa. In one instance, I was driving a tank while my friend rode on it with a Sniper Rifle. I'd shell an area, and he'd pick off stragglers with the rifle. You can steal enemy air fighters and use them in skirmishes, or use them to back up a buddy on the ground. If you distract the enemies by flying overhead, he can get closer unnoticed until it's too late for the enemies. Knock enemies out of stationary gun turrets and climb in yourself. <p>Enemy placement is randomized a bit, so no two battles are ever alike. Voice acting is quite good, graphics are beautiful and have NO slowdown at all, and the sounds have a great deal of OOMPH to them. <p>This game raises the standard for all shooters to come. This is American game making at it's pinnacle, and if you've ever wanted the ideal action game, here it is.<p>NO Xbox owner should be without this game!

I had my doubts, but I was proven wrong...
Halo rules.  That's about as good as I can put it.  I really had my doubts about this game, since the hype behind it was enormous and since most console first-person shooters (FPSes), with the glaring exception of N64's GoldenEye, do not play well with console controllers.  But I was truly surprised when I first played Halo.  <p>The graphics are absolutely incredible.  The lighting effects, especially from the Covenant troops' energy weapons, are awesome, and the outdoor environments are absolutely breathtaking.  The control is quite intuitive, even for players used to playing FPSes on the computer with keyboard and mouse, and has a very short learning curve to pick up.  The sound is PHENOMENAL when hooked up to a Dolby Digital-enabled home theater setup.  I heard explosions and combat all around me through my speakers, and really felt immersed in the action.  <p>And there is a lot of action in this game.  Halo definitely puts the &quot;shoot&quot; back in first-person shooter.  Intense battles with smart AI (on both the aliens that you fight against and the human marines you fight with) mark this game.  The vehicles in the game are truly a highlight, as they are wickedly fun to fly and drive around.  But the absolutele best feature in the game is the cooperative play mode.  It is incredibly fun to play this game with a buddy, going through the missions and taking out the aliens together!  Halo is definitely the best cooperative play game this year.  <p>About the only weak point in the game is that is gets a little repetitive about three quarters of the way through.  SPOILER ALERT:  Fighting the constant onslaught of the Flood got a little boring after a while since they all started to look the same and you kept blasting away over and over and over again.  Still, this was a short part of the game anyway, so it didn't really detract too much from this awesome game.  <p>All in all, Halo is easily one of the top five console games of 2001, if not THE best console game of the year.  A truly fun experience and a great way to blow off some steam from a hard day at work.  This is the best reason right now to buy an Xbox.  And if Halo is a sign of things to come, it looks like we're going to see some truly amazing games for the Xbox over the next few years...

The must-have launch title for Xbox
Half-Life really didn't INVENT the sci-fi first-person shooter, but it sure did succeed at doing it well and popularizing the genre.  The Playstation 2 had their stab at it known as Red Faction (a first-rate game, might I add) and now XBox is boarding the gravy-train with Halo.  And I can safely say, after playing more 1st-person shooters than I care to mention, that Halo is a smashing success, as well as a benchmark by which future progress will be measured.<p>The graphics, though not running at the desired 60 fps, are still enough to make you stop and simply scan around using the right analog stick.  The worlds in this game are awe-inspiring, as well as chock full of landscape objects and detail.  And some of those landscape items make all the difference in the world.  THIS is really where Halo shines, because you no longer need to stand toe-to-toe with an enemy to combat it, nor do you need to play peek-a-boo around walls &amp; corners.  Success at Halo depends on using the terrain &amp; surroundings to your advantage as you progress.  Duck behind a rock, circle around the rock to the nearest tree, sprint across to an indentation in the cliff face, the plethora of objects makes fighting so much more realistic and fun.<p>And it isn't only the terrain that makes it interesting, the enemy AI is extremely logical and doesn't pull the typical &quot;charge right into you at gunpoint&quot; or the &quot;run around without any clue or reason to where I'm going.&quot;  If you duck behing a tree, the opposition fire ceases, but take a peek and expect some fire to come your way.  It's so simple, but rarely has the enemy AI been done this well to the point where it looks like they are following some sort of battle plan.  And that goes for your backup also.  The good guys will fall in behind you, lay down cover fire, strafe from point to point, and generally act like a real combat battalion instead of like simple cannon fodder.  Refreshingly accurate!<p>The only disappointments are a fairly limited roster of enemy unit types, some atrocious control on the jeep-type vehicle, and the fact that often you won't really be informed of exactly what needs to be done next, though the game remains linear enough that aimless roaming does not last too long.<p>The XBox hype machine has been in high gear for this particular game, and rightfully so.  It is certainly the launch title to have for the system (like Soul Calibur was for DC, and SSX for PS2) and is so far THE killer-app for the XBox.  If you are at all inclined towards the 1st-person shooter genre, then by all means this should be at the very top of your must-buy game list.

Best.  Game.  Ever.
Hey, all of the reviewers who gave this title 5 stars can't be wrong or misguided.  HALO is simply the best game ever created, on any platform (PC, PS1/2, Nintendo, what have you).  <p>The graphics are lush and gorgeous, with an attention to detail that I have not seen since.  Fire a slew of bullets at an enemy and spent rounds not only fly off your gun, but also stay on the ground.  Blast marks, errant bullets, and blood stains all stay on the environment map, which can leave maps looking like real battlefields after a particularly intense game.  Draw distances are also phenomenal, allowing players to pick off enemies from across the map with confidence (an no small amount fo skill).  <p>The sound is terrific as well, as bullets, grunts, and other ambient noise all add to the atmosphere.  Playing this game with surround sound is simply awesome.  <p>The single player campaign is also great, and offers players of every skill a good challenge.  Legendary is exactly what it sounds like, and beating the game on that level is quite a feat.  A great advantage of HALO's campaign mode is the ability to team up with a friend and take out the Covenant as a team.  The A.I. is also excellent.  The enemies are challenging without 'cheating' (essentially becoming inhuman and never missing), which is what commonly happens on other games at the upper levels.<p>Another of HALO's strenghts is the fact that it is a *tactical* shooter, meaning that the player must use good strategy to survive.  Being able to only carry two weapons at a time really drives home this point, and means that players will have to make sacrifices in order to carry an effective all-around combination of weapons.  Vehicles are also great, and although learning to drive them can be a little frustrating at first most people catch on fairly quickly and are able to go around running their opponents over in short order.<p>HALO's controls are also excellent--easy to learn, with lots of customizable options making them accessible to players of all levels.  This is hearsay for a hardcore PC shooter fan like myself, but I prefer HALO's controls to the mouse/keyboard setup on the PC (yikes!).<p>Finally, where HALO really shines is in multiplayer.  With several different game types to choose from, customizable options affecting scoring, respawn time, weapon/vehicles available, etc... you and your friends will be coming back for more.  No matter how good HALO is as a single player game (and it is very good), it is elevated to Best Game Ever through multiplayer.  There's nothing quite like getting together 7 other friends and blasting each other apart.  No X-Box live support, but it is possible to play online (with some patience).<p>The praise could just go on and on...  If you have to get one game for XBox it has to be HALO.  Accept no substitutes.

Halo is Ageless
I've read most of the reviews here and have decided the majority are written by 12-24 year olds with various levels of game insight and spelling skills.<p>I'm a fifty-seven year old dad and a 30 year veteran of corporate wars, so here's my take on Halo.<p>I don't know squat about too many other video games (note to A Gamer - MS didn't pay me off, but I would take it if they did. So should you.), I wouldn't know a pixel from a fractal whatchamacallit, and I only use the word awesome to describe sunsets or God. But one thing I do know, Halo is extraordinary. Playing it alone or with a comrade is pure enjoyment.<p>Those evenings when I come home from another sortie into the jungle of work, I can pop in Halo, kick back, and blow away several hours of stress build-up by blowing away hundreds of those scabby bi-pedal creatures shlumping menacingly toward me at every turn (note to self - cancel meeting tomorrow with Marketing). Dude (excuse me), trudging across that dark frozen landscape with machine gun at port arms wary of an ambush, kneeling with the rocket launcher leveled at a Covenant tank, fighting my way through the Library, the Pillar of Autumn, the Covenant starship, driving a warthog on the beach, flying a banshee in the mountains, skulking through corridors, tunnels, and over bridges,...<p>Bottom line: Halo is guy therapy. (note to self - try to get out more.)

Addicting, enhanced for multiplayer, with the Xbox's power!
Welcome to the world of Halo, where one supreme genetically enhanced human must fight to save the fate of the universe. You and your friends can play co-operative in the fight against the Flood and the Covenant. Play with your friends in split-screen versus matches that unleashes the almighty power of the Xbox to set a limit of 16 players, which can play simultaneously through either 4 Xbox's and 4 T.V., or through the internet.<br>   <br>     First, Halo introduces a new meaning of how FPS (first person shooters) will be played. In the past Goldeneye intrigued many with it's cache of weapons that let players battle each other with the classic Bond theme. Perfect Dark set new standards of the numerous customizable ways to play. Red Faction incorporated fast-paced action that let one pound right through walls with explosive weapons. Halo has set the standard with all of the great ideas of the past now combined with a power gaming unit- the Xbox. <br>     <br>     Second, in multiplayer players can choose pre-made game styles or customize their own type of game play. You get to choose to play either head-to-head, free-for-all match, or teamed play (the best choice). Teamwork is the factor of Halo. Players can choose to play with vehicles that include the Warthog- a all terrain mean machine truck that has the capacity to seat one driver, a gunman operating a swivel 3 barreled machine gun, and another can take the passenger seat and still shoot the weapon in their inventory. The Scorpion tank is doomsday machine of monstrous proportions- it can seat up to 5 people, 1 driving the tank that can shoot the cannon or shoot the secondary machine gun, 4 other passengers are seated on the outside exposed and can shoot their inventory weapon. The ghost is face light vehicle equipped with dual mounted plasma guns which only seats one person.<p>     Third, if you're short of other players or just want to pump up the fun factor then you're in for a surprise. The power of the Xbox provides Internet game play only through broadband. Simple hook the Ethernet card to your DSL or cable modem with a Ethernet cord and prepare to enter a revolutionary way a of game play action. Team up in dividends of 2s, or 4s to fight each other to the maximum of 16 players that can play simultaneously.<p>     In conclusion, if you enjoyed Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Red Faction, or any other addicting FPS, then consider playing/renting/ or buying Halo. Get ready you are in for the ride of your life. Take the step into the future of gaming.

THE BEST 1ST PERSON/3RD PERSON SHOOTER
I played this at the mall and wow. This game has awesome graphics, even better gameplay and (supposedly) has 26 multiplayer modes. There is also a huge variety of weapons including the assault rifle, and the energy rocket launcher. You can even jump into tanks and covenent fliers and blow some covenent scum right off the surface of HALO (the alien ring world where the game takes place.) You dont even have to rent this game; JUST BUY IT. It will undoubtedly be the best $[] you'll probably ever spend. This game also has a compelling story line which keeps you hooked to this game for hours at a time. the enemy is actually "smarter" than they are in most games. In the higher difficulty levels, the enemy knows when thier out-gunned and they hide and ambush you. if you throw a grenade, they'll run for cover. This game is so realistic, when your done playing, you'll feel like you were just on HAlO (especially with dolby digital surround sound.) It (gasp) even has a co-op mode which lets you and a friend take on the covenent together. This game isnt worth $[], its worth A hundred! get this game with your xbox, you wont be sorry.

Halo: FPS Evolved
Halo's a first person shooter. Which means that from a first person perspective (mostly), you shoot stuff. The formula hasn't changed a whole lot since Quake's addition of the real third dimension, but Halo's beauty lies in its execution. The game world provides an interesting place to fight, from its wide-open meadows, to cramped, claustophobic internal corridors. The AI, both enemy and friendly, is some of the best ever seen. The Covenant soldiers, your fellow inhabitants on Halo, will outflank you. They will chase you. They will bring reinforcements, they will gun you down, and they will laugh at and mock your still warm corpse. The little cowardly grunts will run and scream, and panic appropriately, when you stick a plasma grenade on their face. The friendly AI will not only realistically follow you and augment your offensive capabilities, but will show genuine anger at fallen Covenant, and flee from friendly fire. <p>The end result is that while not necessarily revolutionary in terms of gameplay, the execution gives it a revolutionary feel. You rarely feel alone on Halo - whether it's marines fighting by your side, or Cortana (an AI, that's been loaded into your suit) telling you to "Watch out, there's two of us in here, you know?" - there's always someone, or something to interact with. <p>The addition of vehicles, on top of all this, gives Halo an extra dimension that keeps the gameplay feeling fresh. Hop in a Warthog jeep, with a friendly soldier manning the chain gun in the back, and you can plow through huge numbers of enemies, nigh-effortlessly. Snipe a Covenant Banshee pilot, and their mini-plane will crash into the ground at your feet, and skid to a stop mere feet in front of you (or if you're not careful, the wreckage will take you out, as well). If you're particularly careful, you can even snipe the pilot out of the plane, and hop into it yourself. <p>All this adds up to a sense of immersion and freedom that are almost unmatched in FPS history (Deus Ex being the sole major exception). While some of the level designs midway through the game can get repetitive, the sheer sense of danger, panic, fear, that the game can create are enough to keep a player interested even wading through piles and piles of enemies. <p>Every surface is bump-mapped, every surface is beautifully textured. While Halo doesn't feature the volumetric grass found in games like Tony Hawk 2X, the textures on the ground, on the rocks, on *everything* are fantastically detailed. On the Dreamcast, or even on the PS2, walking close to a surface often reveals a good deal of pixelization on textures that cover most large surfaces. Not so on the xbox. The closer you get, the better things look. It's rare that you'll find a mip-mapping boundary, and it's rare that you'll find *any* texture defects. <p>The character models are highly detailed, and very well animated, particularly the model for the Master Chief. There are very few moments in the entire game, where the animation will pull the player out of their state of immersion - there are few clipping problems, there are few jerky transitions between animations. Almost all the time, things look realistic, smooth, and believable. Snipe a Covenant Elite in the head, and it will crumple, lifeless to the ground, just like you'd imagine it would. <p>Halo isn't just a graphical representation of a few levels that are tied together to form some mishmash of a coherent story. Even when there are large changes if your orientation between levels (being transported on a dropship, for instance), the variety of graphical detail, and the sense of good overall design always keep you feeling like you're in a *place*, *on* a ringworld, rather than just playing a game set on one...

Halo is the best game ever
Pros:<br>Storyline<br>Cooperation, Single player, and Multiplayer battle modes<br>Variety of human and alien weapons<br>Many human and alien vehicles<br>Squad bases combat<br>Different groups of aliens<p>Cons:<br>Not to many levels<p>Graphics:<br>The graphics are just fantastic, both the Aliens and Humans look very real. Also the landscape looks great untill you look up close of course.<p>Sound:<br>Great sound effects and music, I think the  music really goes along with the story and makes it feel like you are watching a movie. The only thing about the sound is that the aliens speak in english<p>Gameplay:<br>The gameplay is another great part of this game because you need to involve strategy to win, and with the vehicles and variety of weapons it is even better.

lives up to the hype
I played Halo in a 16-person multiplayer capture the flag competition at one of Microsoft's "Xbox Unleashed" parties.  I also got to watch a decent player run through a few levels of the single player mode.  The biggest issue with any first person shooter on a console is control.  Honestly speaking, Halo's control is just not as good as the classic PC mouse and keyboard setup.  And yet, for first person shooters on a console, Halo's control is a breakthrough.  I, and many others around me, were surprised by how easy it was to adjust to Halo's control scheme.  Furthermore, it is highly customizable, you can even adjust the sensitivity of at least one joy stick.  I would not be surprised to see claims in the future that Halo's control is superior to the mouse keyboard combination.<p>Onto the graphics... Evil Empire or not, Microsoft delivered on the graphics in Halo.  Halo is a sunny world with bright blue skies complete with drifting clouds.  Jutting steel towers hiding vast underground complexes are set against a background of curved landscapes (another words, Halo's engine does curved surfaces and they are not afraid to show it off).  All the character models look and move organically and the vehicles, though somewhat derivative of Star Wars, are very cool.   I heard some complaints about frame rate from a guy on the losing team of our little competition, but I thought it played smoothly throughout. <p>Because of the noise at the party, I can't judge the audio, but I can tell you that the game would be worth it with no sound at all.  Halo is packed with features, including, I'm told, new multiplayer game types and all the networking software needed to make hooking up your Xbox to a LAN, or directly to a cable modem, a snap.  And last but not least, lets not forget that the fun factor is high, after all you even get to jump into vehicles and mow down everything in your path.  Basically, I am willing to go out on a limb and say Halo looks like it will live up to, and maybe exceed, all the hype.  Buy an Xbox so you can play this game.

Ground Breaking
I loved it from the moment I booted it up.  It wowed me with its wonderful graphics even before I started playing.  When I did start I found that it's gameplay was even better!  Pretty soon I was blasting aliens like a pro.  If your looking for a good Xbox game to buy then get Halo.

HEAVEN ON EARTH
This game is quite possibly the best game ever made.  Now i am the kinda guy who stays up till 3 in the morning on a school night to see Commando or Rambo.  I am a killing fanatic.  Any game were i can feel the carnage i love it.<p>This game rocks anyway you look at it.  The multiplayer is awesome.  There are so many game types it makes it almost impossible to choose which one you like.  In the multiplayer there are a lot of characteristics within the settings that you can change.  Only one bad side though.  You cannot ever play with bots.<p>Another great factor of this game is the co-op.  This is the best to play with two people and almost as fun with only one(yes i know it sounds strange, co-op with only one person ur crazy).  The different level difficulties enhance your gaming experience even more.  You can choose to have fun on easy or really challenge yourself on the hardest.<p>The single player rocks.  No matter what level you play on what difficulty or how much you get beet you'll have a lot of fun.  There are so many levels and each contains a new enhanced gaming experience.<p>The game has a huge selection of things in which to kill your enemy.  The vehicles are awesome.  There is a 4 wheel stearing, all-terrain, buggy with a machine gun mount on the back(which you can use and comes in handy in co-op).  There is a tank that has a machine gun and the usual artillary.  Enough of the human stuff.  The covenant(alein race threatining human existance in the universe) vehicles are almost as cool.  They have what they call a.. a.. i forgot. but it is a hover vehicle that shoots dual plasma rounds out the front and is extremely fast.  The covenant also harbor the banshee.  The banshee is basically upgraded version of the whachamacallit thingy.  Ugrades include being able to fly, and able to shoot fuel cells as explosives.  Don't get your hopes up though.  The banshee is the only vehicle you can't use in multi.<p>To move on to weapons.  Like vehicles there are human and covenant weapons.  covenant weapons are based on energy and batteries so you don't need to reload(except for needler).  But the humans have my personal favorite.  Good old fashioned bullets.  More specifically the sniper rifle.  I'm a sniper freak and this game is the best for people who like to nest and snap off a few head shots.<p>One more last suggestion.  I reccomend that if you like to read to read the halo book.  Yeah i know it sounds gay but you will never get confused and you will know who and what everything is whether it be human or alien.<p>BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED

Halo: Fufilling your gaming needs!
You are the Master Chief, an elite soldier and Master Buttkicker aboard the human starship Pillar of Autumn. In your missions against The Covenant, you'll fight your way deep into Halo to discover its secrets before they do. Secrets that may best be left buried... <p>As you might expect, graphics are fan-frickin-tastic. Huge, convincing outdoor environments. Monsters that look like they've been decomposing at the bottom of a swamp for a century. And the frame rate remains perky...only towards the end of the game when things go bananas did I detect a bit of slowdown. <p>Oh yessssss...vehicles. In this game you are not just on foot, you get to drive vehicles occasionally too. There's a jeep, a tank, a hover vehicle, and a flying vehicle. This is a lot of fun, because the vehicles are easy to control once you get used to them, plus if you have any marines on your side, they will climb on to the side of your vehicle, or take up the gunnery position of the vehicle and chew up enemy forces. <p>There are multiplayer modes where you race other players in vehicles (Rally, Race), and many, many spins on deathmatching. My favorites are Stalker, where one player is invisible, and Phantoms, were all players are invisible (you use your radar and nav points to hunt down the invisible players). There are both team and free-for-all versions of most matches. And finally, yes, yes, oh God yes, you can play the single player campaign co-op. <p>Pros:<br>Single player campaign can be played co-op<p>Vehicles are a riot, and they're included in multiplayer (lots of multiplayer modes too)<p>Best control ever in a console shooter. Exclamation point.<p>Lots of multiplayer modes. No, really. LOTS of multiplayer modes.<p>Stunning graphics and clever use of models<p>Cons:<br>Architecture obviously repeated in places<p>No bots for multiplayer mode<p>Thanks for reading my review! Please tell me if it helped you in making your decision to buy HALO! :)

Rules the school...
Pretty much the best first person shooter to date, regardless of platform, and definitely worthy of the hype.  I have to admit that I was initially skeptical about all the hyperbole when I got my XBox, since I've yet to see any FPS that actually worked well without a keyboard and mouse (including GoldenEye), and very few first person shooters managing to actually involve you in the story (except for Half-Life and Deus Ex).  But Halo delivers on all fronts-the storyline and scripted events are tight, the level design is phenomenal (no idiotic boss battles a la Return to Castle Wolfenstein or platform jumping sequences), and pushes the envelopes of the genre in terms of enemy AI and graphics.  Perhaps more than anything, Halo innovates-you experience squad combat with ally AI that is tight and pretty helpful, you can pilot virtually any vehicle in the game, levels are massive and varied, etc.  Finally, this is the first shooter I've ever seen that actually makes you feel like you're in the midst of a war--there are several sections in the game where you literally are thrown in the middle of dozens of enemies battling with each other, and can alter the outcome of the battle through your action or inaction.  Adding to the mayhem is the possibility of 2-player co-operative play through the missions, which is by far the most addictive feature I've seen in any first person shooter--I've literally melted days away with friends crouched in front of the XBox in unproductive Halo bliss...

Unacceptable ESRB Rating
I am a parent who recently bought this game for my child.  I was worried that the rating given was Mature, but I decided to let my child get it in spite of the rating.  I played the game for a little while before letting my child play it, to make sure the content was okay.  I found that I was actually quite puzzled why this rating was given.  The violence is mild, and the gore is minimal, in fact, I've seen more gore in Teen rated games!  I was very happy with the results and let my child play the game.  I even watched her for a while, just to make sure my decision was a good one.  There is no sexual content, no explicit language, nothing at all but mild violence.  At first, this game's rating scared me, having read of other Mature rated games such as the Grand Theft Auto Series, but this game was much much better.  In Grand Theft Auto (as I'm sure most parents know), you can do many things that would be considered perverted or sick, and I would agree wholeheartedly with the rating given on that game, and continue not to let my children play it.  But with Halo, I was surprised to find that the violence was actually minimal.  So if there are any parents out there wondering whether to let their child try or buy this game, you have my word that Halo is a kid-friendly game, even for the most strict parents.

Halo is worth buying an Xbox over
My first exposure to Halo came almost exactly one year before I actually purchased an Xbox. A friend had received the system for Christmas, and had already decided that the only game he'd be playing for the next six months was this one. A little cautious myself, I picked up the gigantic black controller with the clear bubble in its center, and embarked on the first of many four player fiascos. Truth be told, this is a very easy game to pick up on. Much like the N64's Goldeneye, it's quite simple to learn but nearly impossible to master. And, also as in Mr. Bond's Nintendo 64 excursion, there's really nothing I can say here to prepare you for the absolute madness which awaits you in the multiplayer mode. <br> <br>Perhaps the most notable feature of the multiplayer mode is the ability to customize your character. With the Box's hard drive allowing for an almost infinite number of saves, it doesn't take long for the list of names in your player select screen to become unwieldy. It's something that was previously reserved for online PC players; there's no more guessing about who just killed you or who's controlling the tank. It's printed, right there on your screen, in bold letters. In addition to that, there's the underspoken ability to create, tweak and save your own game types. If you're hooked on deathmatches with multiple vehicles, no radar and infinite grenades, you need only make that selection once. The system saves all the information, so you won't need to select all the same settings the next time you're hungry for a deathmatch. It's an enormous part of what makes Halo so good, but it's also something that's very easily overlooked. <br> <br>The single player, mission-based game is unbelievable. It amazes me how far the First Person Shooter has come since it took its first baby steps in the mid 90s, and Halo is currently the cream of the crop. You portray the "Grand Master", a legendary warrior cryogenically frozen and revived in Humanity's darkest hour. Players never see his face, but his deep voice quickly confirms both his identity and his authority. There's a REASON he's our last hope, and the experience heard in his voice misleads gamers into believing they're legends in and of their own right. It's a really cool feeling, to say the least.<br> <br>Unfortunately, for a game of such visual importance, the actual characters themselves aren't everything I'd hoped for. You'll endure a few cutscenes that probably shouldn't be there; eyes and lips move clunkily. The seams are showing. Make no mistake, the big names and faces in Halo don't give Final Fantasy X's cast a run for their money. The captain (one of the game's centerpiece characters) is emotionless, and difficult to form an emotional tie with... which takes away from the impact of later levels, when you race against time to save his life. Cortana, a computer-generated hologram, is obviously meant to be the most visually stunning character in the game... and even she falls short. The real stars of the show are the enemies, but they're afforded the luxury of being completely new designs. <br> <br>But while the character models aren't as incredible as I'd expected, the surrounding scenery alone makes up for it, and then some. You'll see individual blades of grass. You'll see the blood squirt momentarily out of an enemy, moments after you've shot him, and then pulse along the rhythm of his heartbeat. You'll hide behind individual leaves, or behind the thick mist accumulating beneath a waterfall. It's simply unbelievable.<br> <br>I'll again draw the comparison to Goldeneye when it comes to controls. There's no question, the system's controller was designed specifically with this game in mind. After a couple plays, you'll be jumping, tossing grenades, firing, ducking, and striking enemies with the butt of your rifle. For god's sake, there's a button devoted to turning on and off your flashlight... AND IT'S CLEAR. Xbox developers may as well have labeled it the 'flashlight button.' Add to that a built in rumble feature, dual analog sticks (emulating the feel of a PC Shooter, where players use the keyboard and the mouse) and easy-to-reach trigger buttons, and you've got a sweet control setup. I don't have a bad thing to say about it.<br> <br>Where the visuals of non-playable characters are lacking, the audio most definitely is not. There are hundreds of possible quotes from this game, more depending on which difficulty level you're playing under. That's right, the tougher your setting, the more mature the language surrounding you. They weren't kidding when they said things get more realistic on the hardest difficulty. The voice acting is on par with a major motion picture, with a few exceptions. The production is just incredible... everything is crystal clear, whether you're chatting in an echoing hallway or on the battlefield. Dolby Digital Surround is supported, and that too is top notch. Nothing can express the value of knowing which direction a rocket is coming from, especially when your back is turned. <br> <br>The largest gripe I have with Halo is its bizarre, seemingly random awarding of checkpoints. No lie, I've been in the middle of the firefight when the system has decided to save my progress. While it doesn't immediately affect me, it does serve as a point of intense frustration when I die further down the line. Instead of reappearing in relative saftey to attempt the task again, I'm dropped right back into that firefight. It gives the player an unfair handicap, and ALWAYS catches him / her by surprise. I'd have much rather had the option to assign my own checkpoints.<br> <br>What it all boils down to is this; Halo is worth buying an Xbox over. It's the end-all, be-all Microsoft desperately needed to put themselves onto the map as a force in the home console business. It's everything you've heard it is, and more.

One of the best ever, for ANY system.
Having read about Halo when it was being developed for the PC, I was excited to see screenshots and information about the game, and eventually a really cool trailer. When Microsoft bought the developer, Bungie, I figured that the Xbox version of the game would suck, based on my estimation of other console shooters. My friend splurged on a Xbox when it came out and wouldn't stop talking about how cool Halo was, so I had to see for myself. I bought the Xbox and Halo. Once the startup screen came up I didn't stop playing until 18 hours later when my roommate and I beat the game.<p>In a word? Astounding. The controls took a little time to master, but once I spent a little time (like maybe an hour) they became second nature. Driving was similarly difficult, but once acustomed to the style of driving it was simple, and great fun, wedging the Warthog into buildings to help deliver some extra firepower to the enemies inside. The graphics are outstanding, the water effects being particularly cool, as well as the real feel of the world as a whole. You and vehicles slide on ice, the green lushness of the grass, the white of the falling snow, the raining bodies and debris kicked up by explosions (the sticky grenade effect is hilarious when the grenade sticks to the bad guy's head) all serve to imerse the player into the ringworld of Halo. <p>The AI is deadly, diving out of the way of grenades and warning comrades of danger as they duck behind cover. One particularly harrowing fight was with the invisible Covenant soldier with his very visible sword cutting down your marines. Difficult doesn't even begin to describe some of the scenes, but as frustrating as it was to die over and over again, I always came back with the determination to lick the baddies one way or another.<p>Overall this game will be the crown jewel of the Xbox for a long time, and when finally released for the PC I hope it will be every bit as good as it's Xbox counterpart (with a bigger multiplayer component, of course). I equate this game to some of the other games I consider to be definitive examples of computer/video game entertainment. Metal Gear Solid, Half-Life, Fallout 2, Civilization (2 and 3) and X-Com are all examples of excellent design and execution, and now Halo will proudly reside on that short short list. <p>I never thought I'd say this, but Microsoft's got a real good thing on their hands. Keep it up, Bill.

HALO - BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED
I was new to the Xbox and first person shoot games. So I Bought Halo with the Xbox. What a Brilliant game I just think they have got everything just spot. The graphic are just outstanding, well that also help from the speed of the console.  The game is that good that you can get addicted to it is that good. <br>Outstanding game it is a must have for all Xbox gamers. It is a must.

Read this for the truth
I've been scrolling around reading other people's review for this game. I also read some of the ones that gave this game only 1 star. As an owner of a PS2, GC, GBA, and Xbox ( I blew out my December's pay check and bought them all on the same night ) I found myself restlesstly glued to the big Xbox controller during the holidays season all the way up to July, why? one word: HALO.<br>   I've spent more time on this game than I did on GTA3, MGS2:SoL, Super Smash Bros. M. combined.I'm not going through all the details of this game because other reviewers already did. What I'm trying to do, though, is give HALO the credit it deserves.<br>... As a long time gamer ( back in those Jurassic days when my cave men buddies was playing with the Atari ) I found HALO to be the most flawless in game play, graphic, and story.<br>   As for several reviewers who said that the hevicle control in HALO was too difficult, here's what you did wrong:<br>   1. Do not look at the hevicle for control, rather, pay attention to the clear blue targeter in the middle of the screen<br>...One guy boasted by saying that there are no storyline in HALO, rather, it's just a shoot'em up type of game. This guy obviouly have NEVER, EVER play HALO before.<br>   One kid even mentioned that HALO is too easy. Try playing it through in Legendary mode ( even with 3 other players ) and the enemy AI will make you wet your little Huggies diapers.<br>   As for the graphics, HALO shutted them up because they know that their PS2 and their GC cannot match it.<br>   I think that I've pretty much proved my point there ... maybe something's still missing. If you want some prove to back me up, say .... you've never played HALO before, try reading EGM issue #150, and #153. They have the full scoop on HALO ( hey, they're the most bought game mag. in the States ) and they even posted it for GAME OF THE YEAR.

Consistently voted Game Of The Year for a reason...
At first, I was skeptical. I don't do first-person shooters on consoles; that's what PCs are for. After all, you can't control your movements anywhere near as well as you can on a PC. Case in point: I hated Bond:Goldeneye for the N64. Hated. Hated the controls, hated the terribly outdated graphics...thought the levels were poor, too. So when I heard about HALO I thought it might be ok for console-only people, but not for me.<p>Having now played the game extensively, I can say that it far exceeds my expectations. The controls are innovative (and allowed for by the cool xbox control pad), and really let you get into the game (while not being QUITE as good as a mouse and keyboard). The multiplayer is fun, with many different ways to play with your friends. The co-op mode of playing through the game's story is cool too, though I wish more than 2 players could partake at once (I suppose they limit it to 2 because this is where the game experiences most of its slowdown).<p>HALO has, BY FAR, the best single-player experience of any FPS game I've ever played. BAR NONE. The story is good, the battle scenarios are cool...I'm really impressed. I want MORE! <p>I could go on...the vehicles are cool, the graphics are impressive, the soundtrack is good, the way you receive your next directions through audio commands is really cool...<p>If you own an xbox, then unless you hate this sort of game, you won't go wrong with HALO.

Best Game Ever
I just got my Xbox 3 days ago, along with the delicously sweet HALO. I set it up, and put HALO in right away. I was amazed at how incredible this game was. The Xbox controller made the game even more fun with the ease at which you can control the master chief.  Not only can you engage greatly modeled Covenant warriors with guns, who happen to have great AI, but you can also take control of jeeps, tanks, an alien hovercraft, and a sort of alien fighter.The framerate can kinda take a hit in multiplayer when you get multiple veichles and explosions on the screen, but it wont bother you. At all other times though the framerate is as solid as a rock.The only gripe i have is that they should have had AI bots for multiplayer, but thats just getting finicky. The co-op mode for the campaign is also great. The great plotline and cutscenes in the campaign will keep you playing it till the end. And it does take a long time. The missions are huge 1-2 hour monsters that are great fun. I just cant say enough good things about this game. So what are you waiting for? Go pick up an Xbox with Halo!!

Expensive, but worth it
Yes, I would have to agree with other reviewers here, this item is on the expensive side.  But I believe it is worth the price because Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter is easy to install and easy to set up.  In short, it works and I don't mind paying extra for something that works as intended with no hassels.<br /><br />To install, you simply insert the USB plug into the USB port on the backside of the Xbox 360.  This Network adapter snaps into place so it never moves and the cable is just long enough preventing clutter.  A very intelligent design.<br /><br />Software set up was a breeze.  In my situation, it was automatic after a few menu selections. I did have a concern that there would be a problem because I am using an Apple Airport.  But, no problems at all.<br /><br />Also, the range I receive is better than what others have mentioned here.  I live in a two story house.  My Airport (wireless hub) is located on the east side of the second floor, in a book case next to the outer wall.  My Xbox 360 is located in an outer corner of the den on the first floor on the west side of the house.  Basically, the signal is going from upstairs to downstairs and from one side of the house to the other.  I was actually surprised that it worked without me having to rearrange either room.<br /><br />So, yes it is expensive, but it works without any problems for me.  So many things I buy make you almost jump thru hoops to get them to simply do what they are suppose to. <br /><br />

Wireless is the way to go
My television is in a completely different part of my house from my high speed internet connection, so while I wasn't thrilled to dish out extra money for this adapter, I have to say it was completely worth it.  Since I figured out how to set up my home wireless network and coordinate that with the 360, I get a very strong connection and have had no problems staying connected.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that when I first set up the adapter I didn't known enough about wireless networks to have everything clicking together.  At first the 360 would access Xbox Live, but was using other nearby wireless networks because I did not give the 360 the password ID to access my Linksys router.  I live in center city Philadelphia, and by default the adapter was picking up and using whatever open wireless networks were available.  The range must be good, because it would register about six or seven other networks of varying strengths.  <br /><br />Once I figured out that my Linksys router had a password code (I think it is a WEP number) I was able to punch the router's ID into the 360 and the 360 then automatically connected to the secure wireless router in my home.  I have never had a single issue since.  I don't think this delay in the optimal setup was anyone's fault but my own, since I was pretty ignorant of how wireless networks are set up but I have a feeling it may happen to others.<br /><br />All in all, I think that having a secure wireless network at home is what will become standard in the next few years.  This adapter works great, is small and disappears behind the console, reduces the clutter of wires, and allows you to keep your computer and high speed connection separate and distinct from your television area.  It was definitely a worthy purchase.

Get the Most from Your Wireless Adapter
A lot of people don't seem to understand this, and aren't setup correctly to get the most out of their xbox360 wireless adapter.  Yes, it supports 802.11 a, b, and g. But the important part is that it supports DUAL MODE (i.e. bonded) A and G.  That means that if you have a dual-mode a/g wireless access point, you are using 2 wireless bands, the 2.4GHz band (used by B and G), AND the 5GHz band (used by A). B and G both suffer lots of interference from microwave ovens, bluetooth, and lots of other things. A however does not suffer from such interference.  A's theoretical rate is 54Mbps as is G's. In reality in a best case you might get 26ish mbps for each band. A decent HD video stream can take a steady 20mbps (assuming WMV or AVC/H.264/MPEG-4Part2, etc) or half that for MPEG-2. Dual band A/G allows the wireless network to bond the effective 26ish Mbps in each band for an actual realistic 50+Mbps assuming best case, and half this band isn't subject to local interference.  If you are using a plain old 802.11g router and want to more than double your performance, get a dual-band a/g instead.  Another nice part about the A channel is that not a lot of people use it, so you aren't probably competing w/ other local access points.<br /><br />Oh... BTW... If you are running 802.11g and you have even a single 802.11b device on your network, your whole network will suffer greatly, so get rid of it. 802.11b is obsolete and will bring your whole network speed down.<br /><br />Also, if you are using Windows Media Center and you have Windows Vista on the PC, that version of Media Center has a very simple Network Performance Monitor that allows you to adjust your network in realtime, and it will tell you using a graph whether you reach acceptable levels for SD and HD video streaming.

Any Wireless Bridge Will Work
I thought it would be helpful to let people know that this unit is not the only way to get online wirelessly with 360.  The reason you should buy this product is that it will be guaranteed to be compatible and easy to set up.  If you have experience setting up wireless networks and want to go a cheaper route, you should buy a wireless bridge.  Amazon has them for less than fifty bucks.  I used a wireless bridge with my PS2 and just plugged it into my 360, no additional setup required (bridges store WEP data).

Great Product
Like everyone has said.  This product is great, it works and its so simple to setup and along with that its fast to setup.  Someone else mentioned it having a low range, this is not the case.  I was able to detect 3 other wireless networks around my neighborhood.  This device may be $99.99, but if you have tried other means to get a wireless network going and it nothing has worked this is your best bet.  The adapter fits into the lone USB port in the back of your 360 console, where just above or to the left of the USB port (depending on how you set your console up) the rest of the network adapter snaps into place and thats it.  From there all you have to do is turn on your 360 and go to the guide menu.  Go to the media section and click network settings.  Select the wireless network option all the way at the bottom.  Your adpater will now attempt to locate any wireless networks in range.  Once it has finished that it will display a list of networks in the area.  Do not get worried if you don't see your network on the list.  This happened in my case and all you have to do is click the specify unlisted network.  There you just have to enter you SSID, enter if it has a WEP code, if it does you have to select the kind of WEP it is (128-BIT or another one that I can't remember right now).  Then just enter the WEP code.  If your network does appear on the list just select it and enter the WEP code if needed.  Once all of that has been entered choose the test Xbox Live Connection and if everything was entered properly, it will say you have connection to Xbox Live.  It may so complicated, but really it only takes up to 2 mins. to get it all setup and checked.  I am sure most of you know this already as well, but if you need to find the information needed for the wireless connection it can be found on the computer where your wireless modem is hooked up.  I hope this helps all those seeking to buy this product, the price is high, but if you want no hassle what so ever then this product is perfect for you.

Don't hesitate - buy it! Installs easily, great signal strength
Chose this as an easy solution to internet my XBox 360.<br /><br />Bought retail in Hong Kong for less than the price listed here though...<br /><br />After plugging in the unit at the back and rebooting, the system hunted for wireless connections and quickly found my router. Then feeding in the router's security settings into the console & updating the console mac address into the router and Hey Presto :) I get 4/5 signal strength even though the signal has to pass through two reinforced concrete walls! <br /><br />From opening the pack to connecting to XBox Live in less than 5 minutes... <br /><br />A wonderful product which really deserves 6 stars!<br /><br />

Good stuff.
As far as wireless bridges go this item is expensive. Some can be had for 40-50$ at other sites. BUT those items are a seperate item with another plug and would require more space. <br /><br />This adapter is designed to work perfectly with the the 360 and does just that. It connects to the back of the console (and HD DVD drive if you purchase that) and use the power of the 360. It doesn't take up any extra space and has a strong connection.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone that has a wireless network in their home.

Expensive != Overpriced
At $99 (you can find it for $89 at some places) I have to agree with others who have said this item is a little expensive, but by no means does that mean the Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter is overpriced. The Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter is, by far, the most surprisingly effective and versatile (as in operational conditions) on my wireless network.<br /><br />I have 5 roommates in a large house and we all share my Linksys 802.11G router. Everyone has different types of equipment to hook up to the network with varying results. The router is placed in a strategic position downstairs so everyone can get reception, which is unfortunately one floor down and on the exact opposite side of the house from the living room where the 360 is. Nothing gets reception over there, but this thing is always connected with at least 1-2 bars, even at low signal strength, my connection  to XBOX Live seems to work flawlessly with no dropouts and no lag problems that aren't inherent in any Wireless solution and the speeds are great.<br /><br />If you are looking to go Wireless with your 360, this is the product you must get. The setup is very simple and user-friendly, the device is small and attractive and snaps into place on the back of the 360, and its performance has surpassed my expectations (along with many other reviewers here I see). Five stars.

Works Amazingly
IT Has NEVER lost connection and has a very long distance. This product is great if you live in a big house (1750+ sq. ft.) and you don't want to mess around with wires. 5 Stars

Previous xbox adapter works on 360
I bought the wireless adapter for xbox last year and it worked great. Recently got a 360 and plugged it into the ethernet port and it worked perfectly. It must be the only thing from xbox that can be used on a 360. Don't buy the 360 adapter if you have the previous one, the only thing is the new one supports wireless a signals but g works great anyway. Yes, the new one looks better but not for $100.

A little pricey but well worth it
When I was looking for a good price on one of these i was told that I should go with a cable instead of wireless especially for games like Halo. So needless to say I was a bit worried, but I shouldn't have been because I've been using this for several weeks now and it has worked great, very few lags and normally I have the best connection out of my group. A great buy, I suggest it.

EXCELLENT PRODUCT
Absolutely excellent product.<br /><br />Sets up automatically and right away once you tell the Xbox to go into "wireless mode," and has no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />No online lag for Xbox 360, and I have mine connected a floor above and across the house from the wireless network router.<br /><br />I would absolutely reccommend this product, though it is admittedly very pricey.

A little expensive...
but well worth it. Works as expected and delivers stable connectivity to Xbox Live, can't ask for much else. Intall is as simple as plugging it in, the biggest issue was getting it out of the packaging. If your router isn't near your T.V. this ones a no brainer.

Works Great!
I stressed myself out before buying this. Would it work with my "old" router which is not on the list of compatible routers? Would my wireless router have enough range? What about trying to get everything configured to work together. I tried reading the XBox 360 website, and found plenty of things to worry about.<br /> <br />I bought this, snapped it onto the back of the console, plugged in the USB cord, and as soon as I turned on the console, I was hooked up. It was tougher coming up with a gamertag I could live with than it was installing this adapter.<br /><br />Not only does it work, it takes up very little space. It actually snaps onto the back of the console, so there's one less thing to have sitting on the console, or near it. Well worth the money.

The PS3 Reloaded
RATING<br /><br />I will begin with the rating part so that those who are already familiar with the PS3 line may save a little time. <br /><br />On balance, I found the PS3 Slim or the 'PS3 120GB' to be a worthy addition to the current PS3 line. It comes with several major improvements over its predecessors and the 'trade offs' are few and, to most us, insignificant.<br /><br />This how the new model compares to its predecessors:<br /><br />PS3 SLIM vs. PS3 80/160GB<br /><br />+ $100/200 less<br />+ Smaller<br />+ More energy efficient<br />+ More quiet operation<br />+ Cooler<br />+ Smaller Cell processor manufactured using a 45-nanometer manufacturing process<br />+ New, more advanced HDMI 1.3 chipset<br />+ Easier HDD upgrade<br /><br />- No Linux support<br />- No on-off switch in the back<br />- Push rather than touch 'On' and 'Eject' buttons<br />- Not as pretty<br /><br />= Unchanged game-playing experience<br />= Same great Blu-ray player<br />= Same PSP integration<br />= Same WiFi, Bluetooth built-in<br />= Same Dualshock 3 rumble, motion sensitive controller<br />= Same I/O options<br /><br /><br />The PS3 Slim is a superior product when compared with the PS3 80/160GB models. This relatively inexpensive, feature packed, versatile gaming machine, multimedia hub and outstanding Blu-ray player, earns back the 5th star that I granted the Classic models and I didn't feel that the PS3 80/160GB models deserved. <br /><br />Granted, when compared to the PS3 Classic, the PS3 Slim lacks PS2 compatibility, has 2 fewer USB ports and and it lacks media card slots but these shortcomings are offset by the significantly lower price, energy efficiency, larger storage and an updated CPU and HDMI. And, keeping hope alive by feeding it rumors, who knows? Sony just might add PS2 software emulation once it stops manufacturing the PS2 sometime, next year.<br /><br /><br /><br />MY TEST DRIVE IMPRESSIONS<br /><br />The good news is that you can do just about everything you did with the PS3 80/160GB models and in the exact same way. During my test ride, I was able to play all the games I brought with me without a problem, the Bluetooth remote controller was recognized immediately and so was the Playstation Eye. Both a USB-dongle full-size wireless keyboard, a USB-connected wired keyboard and Sony's own Bluetooth mini-keyboard worked as expected. I was able to upload pictures, videos and music from a USB thumb drive and a USB-connected SATA 2.5" hard disk and play them in the same way I do it on my own PS3. The person who allowed me the test drive suggested that I do not sign into the PSN but I have no doubt that the Slim behaves exactly like its predecessors on the PSN, running HOME or while browsing the Net.<br /><br /><br />The Slim has the exact same ports in the back, the same buttons in front - albeit 'push' buttons instead of the 'touch' buttons, the same 2 USB ports, comes with the same Dualshock 3 controller, USB cable and Composite AV cable accessories.<br /><br />The older PS3s weren't particularly noisy but the Slim seems to be more quiet and, after several hours of play, it didn't get as warm as my Classic. The ONLY 2 USB ports bother me a little because I brought along the Eye, a USB-wired HDD, a USB keyboard and a dongle-based wireless keyboard. That meant that I had to do a lot of plugging and unplugging when testing. In real life, it's not so convenient to charge a controller and access more than one USB-connected peripheral. There are third party generic USB hubs (ugly) or PS3-specific port extenders and media hubs that could be used to increase the number of USB ports and bring back the media card slots.<br /><br />My overall impression of the Slim is "nothing new" at least on surface. The "cooler, quieter, smaller, more energy efficient" you don't notice while playing a game or watching a movie. The really great news about the Slim is that so many more will be able to afford it and, with a larger user base, more developers will feel more strongly motivated to publish more, better games that all of us will enjoy.<br /><br /><br /><br />THE SLIM (PS3) vs. THE 'XBOX 360 ELITE FALL 2009'<br /><br />This is not meant to be a 'fan' statement. I don't own a Wii but I do own an Xbox 360 so I will be able to discuss PS3 Slim vs. Xbox 360 Elite and, hopefully, it may help a little those undecided between the two or those thinking about getting a PS3 as a second gaming console. Please be aware that, even though I own both consoles and I try to be as objective as possible, I do tend to favor the PS3.<br /><br />Parity<br />------<br />- Storage: 120 GB on both systems<br />- CD, DVD playback: both<br />- Bluetooth/IR: Bluetooth included with PS3, Infrared remote for Xbox<br />- Community: PSN/Home memberships are free, Xbox Live includes free Silver membership and one-month Gold subscription, paid thereafter<br /><br />Advantage PS3 Slim<br />------------------<br />- Blu-ray: PS3 only. Blu-ray disks aren't used for HD movie playback but to deliver games as well. Since they store several times more data than a DVD disk, PS3 games can be 'bigger' and be still delivered on one disk, eliminating the need for swapping during gameplay.<br />- WiFi: included with PS3, available as an add-on for Xbox.<br />- HDMI 1.3a on PS3 (more vivid colors, better sound) vs. HDMI 1.2 on Xbox<br />- Controller: wireless on both systems, rumble on both, PS3's only is motion sensitive, rechargeable batteries built into PS3's, Xbox rechargeable battery packs available for purchase.<br />- Integration with a handheld device: PS3 integrates with the PSP, the Xbox offers Zune integration. I would call it 'advantage PS3' because the Zune integration is limited to file transfers.<br />- Internal power supply: yes for the Slim, a large external 'brick' for the Xbox.<br />- Ability to upgrade the Hard Disk: the PS3 could use any cheap 2.5" SATA on the market (a 500GB can be had for $90 at the time of this writing and the existing PS3 disk can be recycled to upgrade a laptop or as external storage) without voiding the warranty. I am not aware Xbox HDD upgrades beyond 120GB but, judging by the 120GB upgrade HDD for the smaller models, they are likely to be proprietary, more expensive solutions.<br />- Slim comes with USB, Ethernet and Composite cables, Xbox has only Composite in the box.<br /><br />Advantage Xbox 360 Elite Fall 2009<br />----------------------------------<br />- Headset: not included with PS3 but any Bluetooth device will work, wired headset included with Xbox Elite.<br />- Ethernet: PS3 supports Gigabit Ethernet, Xbox is limited to 100BASET-T.<br />- USB ports: Xbox comes with 3, Slim has only 2.<br /><br />It seems that a PS3 Slim can be brought to parity with the Xbox 360 Elite by purchasing a Bluetooth headset (possibly for less than $10 and that would make the PS3 a superior choice since the Xbox headset is wired to the controller. For the amount, the PS3 will match and surpass Xbox feature for feature if we don't factor in exclusive Xbox games or unique Xbox Live features.<br /><br />To bring the Xbox 360 Elite to parity with the PS3 one would need: a WiFi adapter ($70) and rechargeable batteries ($10). I will not add the various cables to the list because, depending on setup, they may or may not be needed and PS3's Gigabit Ethernet is not likely to make a difference in anyone's gaming or movie streaming at this time. $80 would bring the Xbox closer to the PS3 but the Xbox won't support Blu-ray, does not have a motion sensitive controller, can't function without an external power supply and, Zune withstanding, it does not integrate with a hand-held gaming device. In addition, continuing the Xbox Live Gold beyond the initial month would be another $30-50 per year for the life of the Elite.<br /><br />I chose not to factor in the quality of available software because it's impossible to be even remotely objective when it comes to judge Sony's exclusives vs. Xbox exclusives. My guess is that, in the end, those who must have Halo will buy a Microsoft Xbox regardless of cost or other features and those who fall in love with Little Big Planet or Uncharted have no choice but a Sony PS3. The general consensus is that, at this time, the PS3 has the superior hardware (see above) while the Xbox has an advantage in exclusive titles and some exclusive content. In addition, many multiplatform games are developed on the Xbox first and then ported to the PS3. That can make the Xbox versions appear to be superior and, more importantly, the PS3 versions do not always take full advantage of PS3s superior hardware. This seems to be less the case as developers are becoming more familiar with the PS3 platform - the software gap, if there is one at this time, it is closing fast.<br /><br /><br /><br />ESSENTIAL ADD-ONS AND ACCESSORIES<br /><br />For those who decided that the PS3 Slim is what they wanted, the list below may help them budget for the extra purchases they may want to consider. There are surprisingly few extra a PS3 REALLY needs and I listed them in order from what I view as the more to the less important or needed. Those at the top are, in my view, more 'essential' than the ones at the bottom, but with the exception of the HDMI cable which is a must have for an HD TV set, you could easily do without the rest or get them later if you really feel that you want them.<br /><br />- HDMI CABLE - It's a must for anyone who already has an HD TV. It's not included in the box and I am not going to provide a link because there are dozens of vendors at Amazon, competing and that's a good thing because one can be had for only a few dollars. Just make sure it's HDMI 1.3. A 'High-Speed' rating is not necessarily a plus if the cable you need is only 3 ft. or 6 ft. long. All HDMI 1.3 cables should be High-Speed rated and only High-Speed cables support 1080p resolutions. At these lengths, paying a premium for 'quality' can't be justified because the odds for the digital signal to be misinterpreted are close to non-existent.<br /><br />- REMOTE CONTROL - Unless your HD TV supports CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) which allows for the user to command and control multiple CEC-enabled boxes with one remote control and for CEC capable devices to command and control each other, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M17AVO">Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote</a> could make the operation of the PS3 a lot easier when you are not playing a game. It's optimized for movie viewing but XMB navigation, running slide shows and shopping at the PSN store are easier with the remote control because it does not need two hands to be operated. In fact, it can be operated with one thumb.<br /><br />- WIRELESS HEADSET - This is the one important component that the Elite bundle includes (theirs is wired) and the PS3 does not. Any Bluetooth headset would do which is why I am not going to insert a link to Sony's product or to anyone else's.<br /><br />- SECOND DUALSHOCK 3 CONTROLLER - Even if you play solo only, a second controller may be charging while the other is in use.<br /><br />- USB PORT EXTENDER - Again, there are many competing offers. I would prefer one where the ports are powered. Some singing games may come with their own extenders.<br /><br />- PS3 EYE CAMERA - This is not exactly a 'must have' but it's definitely a 'very nice to have' as the Eye is not only a camera but also a stereo microphone - depending on your needs, it may eliminate the need for a headset. I obtained mine cheaply, with a used copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R3BLAI">Eye of Judgment</a>. If you decide to go that route, be VERY careful and ensure that the camera is indeed included before your order.<br /><br />- MEDIA CARD READERS - They would plug into a USB port and will allow your PS3 to read/write to Media/Multimedia/Secure Digital, Memory Stick (PRO), Compact Flash, or XD Picture cards. They can be had for anything from $1 to $20. <br /><br />________________________________________________<br /><br />Note 1: MY OWN BIAS<br /><br />We own a 'Classic' 60GB PS3, currently upgraded to 320GB, DualShock 3 and complemented with various peripherals: PS3 Eye, Logitech Driving Force GT Racing Wheel, Bluetooth keyboard attachment, headset... etc. We also own an Xbox 360 Elite, 3 PSP 3000's (got 3 kids) and a second-hand DS. We used to have a PS2 but we sold it shortly after purchasing the PS3. I've helped several of my neighbors purchase, install and upgrade their own PS3's. I am posting this review because I had the opportunity to test drive a PS3 Slim for several hours a couple of nights before the official launch - someone I know works at a store that sells gaming consoles.<br /><br />Speaking for myself only, I tend to favor the PS3 for several reasons and here they are:<br /><br />- WiFi - This is a major convenience for me. I hate 'wires' and the PS3 has the WiFi built in and it's VERY easy to set up.<br />- Blu-ray - I was an early adopter and I haven't bought 'new' DVDs in more than a year. Having the PS3 doubling up as a Blu-ray player is another major convenience for me.<br />- HDD Storage upgrade - I don't believe that 120GB is sufficient these days and our console has exceeded the 120GB threshold already after lots of downloaded games and movies and transferring thousands of photos and songs to it. A PS3 can be easily and inexpensively upgraded to 500GB today and this is a big plus.<br />- Little Big Planet - It's a Sony exclusive and my kids just love this game. They would probably run away and resettle with a family that has LBP if I got rid of the PS3.<br /><br /><br />________________________________________________<br /><br />Note 2: THE SLIM'S SPECS AND FEATURES<br /><br />- 45nm, 7-core Cell processor CPU<br />- RSX - Based on NV47 Chip (Nvidia GeForce 7800 Architecture) for graphics<br />- Updated HDMI chipset (bitstreams hi-res DTS-HD, TrueHD)<br />- 256MB XDR Main RAM and 256MB GDDR3 VRAM memory<br />- 120GB Hard disk - 2.5" SATA - can be replaced with any 2.5" SATA and a compatible 500GB HDD can be had for about $90 at the time I write this review<br />- Blu-ray 2.0 player (possibly still the best) that also plays DVDs and CDs<br />- Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T wired networking <br />- WiFi 802.11 b/g (from 10 Mbps up to 54 Mbps) - wireless networking I couldn't live without<br />- Bluetooth 2.0 for game controller, headsets, keyboards and so on<br />- Video resolution up to 1080p<br />- Audio supported: LPCM 7.1, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD, AAC<br />- Other outputs: HDMI, Optical, Composite AV<br />- Other I/O: 2 High-speed USB 2.0 ports<br />- Power: dual 120/240V<br />- Power consumption: 250W<br />- Weight: about 7 lbs.<br />- Dimensions: about 12" x 2.5" x 12" (my measurements)<br />- Included controller: DUALSHOCK 3<br />- Included cables: USB and Composite AV, power chord<br /><br />Additional features:<br /><br />- Displays JPEG stills.<br />- Multi-featured, surprisingly good slide show functionality.<br />- Plays MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4/h.264 videos.<br />- Bitstreams DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD to receiver<br />- Upconverts DVDs to 1080p over HDMI<br />- XMB in-game access.<br />- In-game and off-game text and voice chat (headset, keyboard or Eye are needed).<br />- Video chat with up to six people (PlayStation Eye is required)<br />- Can discover media servers on the home network and stream content from any DLNA-compliant device.<br />- Web browser (still has some usability and compatibility issues) but plays YouTube well.<br />- Google Web search.<br />- Remote play on a PSP connected to any wireless access point - play music, videos, show pics, turn on the PS3 remotely if on stand-by<br />- Upload PSP games purchased from the PSN Store to the PSP.<br />- Online software updates improve PS3 functionality and keep the Blu-ray player features current.<br />- Online third party updates.<br />- Online gameplay.<br />- Download and play PS3 games and demos from the PSN store.<br />- Download and play PSOne games.<br />- Download and play movies and shows from the PSN store.<br />- Supports HDMI Consumer Electronic Control (HDMI-CEC) - control the Slim through the remote of any CEC-enabled TV such as a Bravia.<br /><br />________________________________________________<br /><br />Note 3: HDD UPGRADE<br /><br />If you are on the upgrade path, less than $90 would buy you a 500GB drive. The one that I tested would be the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023MYNCE">500GB Scorpio Blue Mobile Sata 5400RPM 8MB 2.5IN</a> which replaced my laptop's 60GB drive and a friend's 80GB PS3 HDD. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 80GB or $160GB or 120GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKC102">StarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosure</a> worked for me. After I upgraded my own console to 320Gb, I used the free leftover drive as a backup device for family photos.

For me, a new experience!
Let me start out by saying that I'm currently 56 years old and everything I know about video game consoles can fit on a fingernail clipping.  A couple of years ago, my companion bought me a PS2, because she had recalled my mentioning in passing (after seeing advertisements for some pretty interesting sci-fi-themed games) that I was curious about what's going on in that medium.  The game technology seemed to have progressed light years since I last paid attention, sometime in the late 80s, early 90s, which went something like this: you start out with some objective, and then the game play steadily quickens until you eventually lose against the computer.  It was very dull.  After she bought me the PS2, the only game I bought was Grand Tourismo 4 (she had given me with the console itself Superman Returns, but I didn't like it), with which I relaxed by racing the realistically rendered cars around some impressively detailed tracks, but never getting into the more sophisticated levels of the game.  Then about four months ago, my son lent me Resident Evil 4.  Of course, you gamers know this was a benchmark in game development, and can understand why I became completely immersed in it.  It was truly a creepy experience.  You weren't just WATCHING a horror movie; you were IN it.  Here I was, at my age, suddenly finding myself lost for literally hours a day -- one weekend, twenty hours straight; my body ached -- then thinking about the game when I wasn't playing it, looking forward to the moment I could resume the story.  After I beat it, I went through it three more times.  Then I bought God of War II, quite by accident (I selected it for the price, a mere $20), unaware that this, too, was a hit game, and another benchmark.  The graphics were so good, so stunning, so grand and sweeping, I played it six times.  Again, hours seemed like minutes; I'd simply lose time.  I was now addicted, and taking into account how good a PS2 was, I figured that the PS3 -- with its Blu-ray technology -- had to be out-of-this-world incredible.  Four weeks ago, I bought this PS3 slim, and it has given me enjoyment that made it worth every penny, and then some.  <br /><br />I can't speak to the technical specifications of the PS3, or how it compares to other consoles.  I'm writing instead to other middle-aged customers who might have stumbled on this page, perhaps shopping for some young relative -- son or daughter; niece or nephew; or grandchild -- to suggest that you should consider buying one of these babies for yourself.  This is one powerful piece of entertainment technology.  Not only does it exceed my expectations as a game console, it's also a BD player, and using the WiFi connection, it permits access to the PlayStation Store, for free demos and exclusive content; plus BD live material, and downloading movies and TV episodes; and you can import your CDs to the PS3's hard drive, to create playlists or just randomize the tracks for playback.  It's become a virtual media center for me.  <br /><br />And the game play?  Oh, man.  The PS3 advances even further the features that make gaming so addictive.  To those of you who snuff that it's a juvenile waste of time, I suggest you ask yourself, is it any different from watching sitcoms or reality TV?  A video game requires you to REACT, to THINK, to ANALYZE.  That is NOT overstating the stimulative benefits.  While they are in fact merely games, game-play itself is a complete immersion in an experience, while requiring good hand-eye coordination and some mental agility.  All the games I've played so far included puzzles as part of the story, and it's a very satisfying feeling when you finally solve a particularly challenging one. <br /><br />If the middle-aged shopper I'm imagining I'm writing to is inclined to wonder if all that tapping on those buttons in specific patterns is difficult to learn, this is my honest answer: At first, yes, it is.  But eventually your fingers learn what button is where, and it becomes second nature, like typing.  To those even older, it's recommended by doctors that as you age, you need new stimuli to keep your acuity.  You won't find a more fun way to do so than this.  Ignore your previous misconception that video games are for teenagers.  An article in USA TODAY from 2004 stated that ". . . the average age of game players was 29 and the average age of buyers was 36, with men making up 59% of the playing audience."  So you can add about five years to those figures, making the average age of video game BUYERS about 40.  I have spent untold hours on my PS3, and connected to my 47" HDTV, it's the ultimate entertainment.  The graphics are sharp and clear, movement of characters is realistic, making it even easier to get totally engaged in the environments.  I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E8VB6O">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>, a great game with easily mastered moves, some tough puzzles, and a very dark, decayed ambiance.   <br /><br />True gamers who are reading this are probably chuckling right now, because this is all pretty much a no-duh to them.  Well, let me offer a hardy THANK YOU for supporting the industry with enough of your dollars to permit it to advance as an entertainment medium in such awesome bounds.  This is the next step toward the future of the ultimate video game experience.  Oh, what will the technology deliver?  A virtual reality, perhaps?             <br />_________________________________________

The best just got better!
As a proud owner of a PS3, I was closely following developments of when the rumored (and highly-anticipated) PS3 Slim would come out. After shelling [...] for the PS3 80GB back in 2008, I was really excited to hear that Sony not only announced a smaller version of the PS3, but also implemented a [long-overdue] $100 price cut. I immediately went out and bought the Slim as soon as possible, and am very happy with it so far. Here are my impressions:<br /> <br />COMPARED TO PLAYSTATION 3 "FAT"<br />A LOT SMALLER<br />I heard that it was smaller, but seeing is believing! The photos don't do the system justice, and it's not really till you see and feel the difference that you are impressed with it. If you can, go into your local game store and check it out for yourself! If you've previously owned a Playstation console, you already know the difference the slimmer version makes when compared to the original, bulky ones. What's really convenient is that the slimmer PS3 not only means your video gaming is more portable, but that you have a really convenient Blu-Ray player.<br /> <br />NOT A FINGERPRINT MAGNET<br />I love the sleek look of my PS3 Fat, but don't like how it constantly needs to be cleaned. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet! The matte finish on the Slim is much easier to maintain. That being said, it doesn't look as shiny and cool, but I think its convenience outweighs that.<br /> <br />MORE STORAGE<br />Storage was never an issue for me on my 80GB system, but for those who wanted more storage, you get 40GB more with this system (120GB in total). It may not seem like much, but you can hold MANY movies, pictures, and music albums with 120GB. If that's still not enough, you can always install a 2.5" hard drive yourself, or better yet, plug in an external hard drive in one of the USB ports. You can easily get a portable 500GB external hard drive for less than $100, or a bigger, bulkier one with around 1TB of storage for roughly the same. That being said, I think 120GB for $300 should be more than enough for most users, and is a significant improvement over the 80GB for $400 that people were paying just a few weeks ago!<br /> <br />STILL NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE<br />This is my one major gripe with the Playstation 3. It really wouldn't have killed Sony to include this feature, as the original Playstation 3's did in fact include backwards compatibility with older Playstation 2 games. A lot of people counter by either saying (1) it doesn't make sense to buy a PS3 to play PS2 games, (2) the graphics on the PS3 are better anyway so why bother with older games, and (3) including backwards compatibility would cannibalize PS3 game sales. <br /> <br />While those arguments might have their merits, I'm still frustrated that my massive PS2 library can't be played on the PS3, and was really hoping that Sony would include backwards compatibility on the Slim! I loved the fact the PS2 was backwards compatible with PS1 games, and really wish that Sony would reconsider this decision. <br /> <br />COMPARED TO OTHER SYSTEMS:<br />PS3 vs. WII<br />I think comparing the PS3 directly to the Wii is a bit like comparing apples to oranges, since they offer such different experiences. The Wii in my opinion is more family-friendly, while the PS3 is better for more graphics-intense games geared towards different gemographics. I'm a huge fan of Nintendo, and I love their very family-oriented game offerings. I own a DS and Wii and still love Mario as much as the days back when I played the original Nintendo (NES). In addition, I think Nintendo's motion-sensitive controllers for the Wii are very innovative and fun to play with! Unfortunately however, for most gamers, the difference in game quality is noticeable when comparing the two systems. The PS3 has AMAZING graphics. On an HD Television, you notice such crisp details while playing the PS3. The Wii features only Standard Definition output, which noticeably weakens it when compared to the other next-gen consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360. <br /> <br />PS3 vs. XBOX 360<br />Microsoft has an impressive gaming console in their Xbox 360 and there are some amazing titles exclusive to the Xbox, but in the end you get less bang for your buck when compared to the Playstation 3:<br /> <br />(1) Online gameplay: You can use the Playstation Network's online features without having to pay a subscription fee like you do for the Xbox. I was never a big online gamer but now I enjoy playing against opponents online.  <br />(2) Internet connectivity: Built-in wireless internet connectivity on the PS3 is a much better bet than having to buy a wireless network adapter for the Xbox. Of course you can simply rely on a wired Ethernet connection, but this might be inconvenient depending on your set-up.<br />(3) High-Def Video: The Playstation 3 doubles as a Blu-Ray player. Microsoft bet on the wrong horse when they were hoping that HD-DVD would come out the winner in the high-def format wars. If you want a Blu-Ray player/video game system combo, the PS3 is a great device.<br />(4) Failure rate: The Xbox 360 has an absurdly high failure rate, with estimates ranging between 30 to 50% ([...]).  I can't verify the numbers, but know from my friends who own the Xbox 360 that they've had a fair share of grief with their systems. <br /> <br />Microsoft does have a few edges, namely the upcoming Project Natal, unveiled at June's E3. While Natal may ultimately be one of the most amazing advances in video gaming, it unfortunately is still some time off from being implemented. That being said, the Playstation 3 is much more worth the cost than the Xbox 360 - at least for now. <br /> <br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br />[...] system that doubles as a Blu-Ray player. Keep in mind though that the bulk of money spent on the video game system will not be in the initial down payment, but the subsequent games, extra controllers (only comes bundled with one controller), and other peripherals/accessories. [...]. Sony's refusal to incorporate backwards-compatibility for PS2 games on the PS3, however, might make your gaming library obsolete in a few years, so if you have the money, you're best off going for the PS3 Slim. You won't regret it.

Great fun, even for an old fart
I was looking for a Blu Ray player and realized that if I paid just a little more, I'd also be able to play some excellent games. If you're looking for something that will play Blu Ray and Games, the purchase of a PS3 is truly a "no brainer" move. I now own the 360, Wii, and PS3. Each has its own qualities and drawbacks. What I really appreciate about the PS3 is they don't try to nickel and dime you to death.... Wi-Fi is included... as is a rechargeable controller (with the charger included)... as is online game play.<br /><br />The nice thing about the Blu Ray capabilities on the PS3, if you're old, is that it really provides you nice cover for getting a game console "No, I am not a 50 year-old who plays video games, I just wanted to watch Blu Ray, and I guess I picked up some games as well."

Best System on the Market
I already owned a original 60GB model that had PS2 backward compatibility.  I was planning on getting another BD player for my bedroom.  I was considering the new Samsung players when this was announced.  It's cheaper and it plays games plus it has a HDD.  It was a no-brainer for me.  The PlayStation 3 is far and away the best console or for that matter Blu-Ray player you can currently get for its price range.  There are many advantages to the 360 and the Samsung BD players, however if I had to have one without the others, my honest and objective recommendation is the new PS3. <br /><br />Like I've said it's a great bargain for a great system, but it is not without its shortcomings.<br /><br />-No PS2 Backward compatibility.  (important to me but not everyone)<br />-No Netflix (360 has Netflix and so do the Samsung BD players) (also, important to me but not everyone)<br />-Backup Utility is awkward (nobody uses FAT32 format anymore and it's actually a process to even format a HDD that way) (You can do it with Swissknife though)<br />-Online play isn't as good as 360's(but it IS free and is being improved even as I type this...)<br />-No mic jack on controller (Bluetooth Headsets are not as easy, so people don't bother.  The result is a lot less people are not talking in multi player games.  A plus side to this is that you don't have to listen to a bunch of 13 year olds screaming the N-word and insulting your mom).<br /><br />I hope I didn't complain too much about the system it really is a great machine and the best deal out there.  <br /><br /><br />

Best NETFLIX enabled blu-ray player ever!
I'm not much of a gamer. I got a sweet deal on an HDTV and wanted a blu-ray player and I have netflix. The PS3 slim works awesomely with netflix watch instantly feature. You can instantly watch everything on your instant queue and more movies. You do have to go online to add the movie you want to see to your queue if its not already on a list, but how convenient, the PS3 also can browse the web. <br /><br />It also streams media from computers on your wireless network. Works well with windows 7 using WMP, and on windows vista using a program called Tversity. You can instantly access your music and videos on your computer, and pictures. Tversity also lets you access youtube vids too.<br /><br />oh yea... and the games are awesome too :)<br />get MGS4<br /><br />bottom line, the PS3 slim is an awesome hub for a home theater setup, if you need a blu-ray player

PS3 Slim + Netflix = Freedom from Cable TV...
After much research, I purchased two PS3 Slim's for my HDTV's because they come with built-in Wi-Fi and a great Blu-Ray player, in addition to being an awesome gaming system.  Plus, the HDMI connections are easy and excellent quality.  I'm 62, and was looking for a box that would let me use the wide selection of Netflix instant download movies and programs.  I'm happy to report that the picture and sound quality of Netflix downloads is very good on the PS3.  Much faster and better than I expected.  Not hi-def, but better than regular TV.  And I have the Blu-Ray to watch movies by mail from Netflix at the highest quality.  Blu-Ray really is an awesome experience if you have a big HDTV and a surround sound system.  I use the Sony CT-500 sound bar and subwoofer that has amazing sound quality and separation.<br /><br />Sony markets the PS3 as an "entertainment system" and I agree that it serves this function very well for me.  I returned my hi-def cable boxes to Cox and am now saving $65 per month that was being wasted on crummy channels with endless commercials that I never watched.  Now I can get quality programming that I choose myself instantly on demand from Netflix without any commercials.  I can play, pause, and re-play a program as much as I like, just like playing a DVD.  Sony PS3 plus Netflix really is wonderful and cost-effective solution for users like me...<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />

If I had to do it all over again...
I'm going to try to hide my disgruntled ex-Xbox360 angst as I write this.  If you are in the same boat that I was, you own a 360, it broke, and you are considering switching to the PS3 (especially with the price drop), this review is for you. <br /><br />Side by side, the PS3 and the 360 have many similarities.  Graphically, they are close, although I think that the Sony edges out the 360 by a little.  Clarity and rendering seems smoother and more flawless.  Sound is improved, but the truth is, my 360 only had component outputs (no HDMI) and the PS3 is running straight HDMI signal.  So, perhaps its unfair, but I didnt have the choice with the Xbox (it was a first gen 360, I realize its an option now). <br /><br />Game catalogs both have their high points.  No one can deny Gears of War, but I am seeing a trend that the really good games are almost always multiplatform now, and the Sony has some that I can't deny are some of the best I've seen.  Upcoming PS3-only games like Uncharted 2 and God of War 3 I feel will seal the deal for me.  All my other favorites are available on both systems (GTA, Saints Row 2, Mercs 2, Assassins Creed, Bioshock), so there's really no loser there. <br /><br />Hardware-wise, the PS3 is the strong, silent type.  I mean, its like a Lexus to a Fast-and-Furious exhaust modified Civic as far as noise.  My 360 was unbelievably loud, and frankly distracted gameplay because of it.  Subtle, ambient surround-sound noises are heard easily with the Sony.  Also, it puts off little to no heat.  I'm not kidding in any way, my 360 used to raise the temp of my "game room" about 5 degrees or more, it was crazy.<br /><br />I wont get into longevity and long-term failure rates on both systems.  The data is out there, and the PS3 has a much higher success rate in this category.  Money doesnt grow on trees, and I really feel that I should only have to buy one console per generation of a system.  If I could do it all over again, I would've gone with the PS3 from the start. <br /><br />Now, I dont online-game, so if thats your thing, then you may take my advice with a grain of salt.  If you are like me and pretty much solo or co-op play on-site, then you won't miss "Live". <br /><br />I'm loving the specs, I'm loving the quietness, and I'm loving the Blu-ray player.  I can't recommend the Playstation 3 enough.

There can be only one......
I'm lucky enough to have a WII, Xbox 360 and a PS3 so I can be completely objective in reviewing all three....  All three have their own benefits, but if you're buying your first console, here's a quick review with my feedback.<br /><br />WII - more of a novelty system.  Great for the casual gamer or kids.  WII Sports and Mario Kart are my favorites and my kids (6 & 8) love it.  It's also a great system when we have company over because there's virtually no learning curve - simply make the motion and you're a pro!<br /><br />Xbox 360 - more of a system for hardcore gamers.  There's a few exclusive games that might be of interest (Halo, Mass Effect, Gears of War), but they seem to be getting fewer as most Xbox titles can now be found on the PS3.  Great online support with Xbox Live.  Out of the box the Xbox 360 is noticeably lacking in hardware to a PS3 - the Xbox is missing wifi, rechargeable controllers (the Xbox controller comes with 2 AA batteries and you can buy rechargeable controller batteries separately), blu ray, need to pay for Xbox Live (PSN is free).  I bought it for the exclusive games and online gaming.  Overall, a strong system, although not as good a value as the PS3 in my opinion.<br /><br />PS3 - In my opinion the clear cut winner (please keep in mind I have all three and am not being a "fanboy").  Out of the box it has everything the Xbox 360 is missing which is more bang for the buck.  Surprisingly, I think the PS3 is also tipping the scales at exclusive content.  My favorites are Killzone (great online), Uncharted, and Demon's Souls.  Other hot titles include Resistance, Little Big Planet, MLB The Show and just released Heavy Rain.  In my opinion the graphics, operating system, controls and functionality are better with the PS3.  Wifi, Blu Ray, rechargeable controller, and free Playstation Network (PSN) just is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />The WII and Xbox are both nice systems, but if you're only buying one - start with the PS3, you won't be disappointed!<br />

Phenomenal Console!!! I LOVE IT! Netflix Streaming Solid...
For weeks I was torn on whether to purchase the PS3 Slim or the XBOX 360 Elite. I own a Zune (soon to be upgraded to the new Zune HD) and it was a compelling consideration to have my Zune integrated with the XBOX. However, after much research it boiled down to the following:<br /><br />- Wireless LAN ** Included With PS3<br />- Blueray Player ** Included With PS3<br />- Free Netflix Streaming ** Included With PS3 (XBOX Requires GOLD Membership)<br />- Low Failure Rate ** Included With PS3<br />- Playstation Network ** Included With PS3 (XBOX is $50/year)<br />- User Replaceable Hard Drive ** Included With PS3 (XBOX uses MS proprietary HDD)<br /><br />The PS3 is a much better value when you consider all that Microsoft "chooses" not to include in the XBOX 360 platform. I'm most certain that the XBOX is a worthy opponent nonetheless, research and clear data led me to but one conclusion... The PS3 SLIM!!!!<br /><br />I purchased the PS3 primarily for the blueray capabilities and to function as a media server. Yet, I am certain that I will become hooked on the gaming capabilities as time goes on. Regarding the media server, I was streaming music WIRELESSLY within 30 minutes after connecting the PS3! DLNA works perfectly with my Western Digital My Book World Edition II. The network setup is amazingly easy and intuitive.<br /><br />Thanks Sony for producing such a phenomenal product and of course for the significant price reduction!!<br /><br />I definitely recommend the PS3 Slim.... go out and get you one too!!<br /><br />Good luck on your purchase...<br /><br />BTW, I did purchase from Amazon but I was one of the lucky ones who hooked one of the Black Friday Specials (hence, it does not show "Amazon Verified Purchase"). I posted the review here for more visibility...<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />UPDATE: December 22, 2009<br /><br />The Netflix Streaming is solid! You have to insert the Netflix Instant Streaming Disc to access the service but access is very smooth and seamless. The only watchout is that the Netflix streaming selections are not as extensive as their DVD/BD selection. It was hard to find recent releases that were available for PS3 Streaming.

Review of PS3 SLIM & PS3 SLIM VS PS3 FAT
I'll try to keep this as short as possible, I'll list the facts First about the ps3 slim, then I'll tell you what can you do with a PS3 and at the end I'll post my impressions about the PS3 Slim, so skip to the part you need if you do not want to read specs or impressions and only want to know what's the PS3 is capable of.<br /><br />*****************According to SONY ps3 slim is officially********************* : <br /><br />*32 percent smaller,36 percent lighter, and has 34 percent less power consumption than latest models <br />*it can stream bitstream Dolby TrueHD & DTS-HD audio (older models can only decode them to uncompressed PCM),<br />*it's identical to the PS3 fat feature wise expect the removal of install OS option (Only 2 guys on earth used it)<br />*it WONT play PS2 Games at all but it can play PS1 games (latest PS3 fat models also does not play PS2 games)<br />*Needs a $20~ stand to be stable in the vertical position (don't place it vertical without the stand, not safe)<br />*Got BRAVIA Sync unlike the Old PS3 (lets you control your PS3 via your TV remote control,if your TV support it)<br /><br />************So what can you do with a PS3?(Will list most important)*******************<br /><br />1-Play Next generation HD games and have access to the exclusive games (I highly recommend Valkyria Chronicles/Killzone2/MGS4/uncharted/GT5p as the top 5 exclusives in my opinion)<br />2-One of the best BluRay players at the market + One of the best DVD upscalers on the market with HDMI 1080p<br />3-120GB storage,you can download Demos/Videos/etc from Playstation network and play online FREE with your friends.<br />4-299$ Hardware that's built like a tank from a company that will support you for at least 10 years (Look at PS2)<br />5-Built in browser/wifi with Flash support (Youtube will work) with Internal Power supply in one package.<br />6-One of the best media players you can also stream media from your pc via wireless or ethernet.<br />7-It plays all PS1 games also you can also download PS1 games from playstation network many games are already available like Final Fantasy VII/Metal gear Solid/Resident evil/Tomb raider/etc.<br />8-Play pictures/Videos from your cameras easily, if your PC is not strong enough to play those 1080p videos the PS3 can do it easily.<br />9-Remember after all it's a game console in the first place and the games are really good on it, if you want to invest on a console and buy games over the years make sure the hardware does not fail on you and the PS3 hardware is as good as it gets when it comes to console reliability.<br /><br />Note: The PS3 have no hidden fees ,it does not require 50$ a year for online play like some others , it does not require 100$~ wireless add on, it have BluRay built it and the hard drive is easily upgradeable (It use 2.5SATA laptops hard drive)<br /><br />************* PS3 Slim impressions and PS3 Slim vs PS3 Fat ****************************<br /><br />*size* if you think PS3 slim is so slim and tiny you will be disappointment the console is still big so ps3 slim is not so slim really but compared to the BEAST old ps3 was i say PS3 slim is a step on the right direction it's about half the height of the PS3 FAT and it's lighter by like 2 kilo/4pounds.  <br /><br />*Temperature/Heat different :<br /><br />PS3 Slim DVD Playback  Temperature 42C Power Consumption 75W<br />PS3 Fat  DVD Playback, Temperature 45C Power Consumption 153W<br />PS3 Slim BD  Playback, Temperature 38C Power Consumption 86W<br />PS3 Fat  BD  Playback, Temperature 47C Power Consumption 160W<br /><br />(As you can see the PS3 slim is much better in here and it use much less power as what Sony claim plus the air coming out of the console is warm while PS3 fat air was HOT.<br /><br />*Fan noise check :<br /><br />Slim is quieter that's for sure it's so quite that i can actually hear the optical disc spinning sound, it was not possible with the old PS3 because the fan noise was so high(not xbox high but still high for my taste) that i can not hear the optical disc.(Compared to the 60GB PS3, i heard the 80GB PS3 were quieter though)  <br /><br />After playing with the PS3 slim for like 2 days i can honestly tell that if you do not care about PS2 playback you must get a PS3 slim it's much better than the old PS3 (Quieter/Smaller/as good as PS3 fat/etc), when i bought my old PS3 i thought i will need PS2 playback but honestly after like 2-3 years i have only used it like 5 times. and PS2 cost like 90$ New and 50$ Used in case you needed one.<br /><br />For importers : If you want to import the PS3 slim i can confirm that the POWER SUPPLY is universal it says 100-240V and 50/60Hz under the PSU package.<br /><br />Get the PS3 slim if you are a gamer or you will miss out a lot of all those great games people will talk about for generations after this one! and I hope this Review was helpful for you guys !

Slimmer & Better!
The new PS3 slim is quite an improvement over the older one in most ways <br /><br />First, let me tell you that i have owned both systems the orignal 40gb PS3 and this 120gb PS3 slim. <br /><br />The new ps3 slim is (obviously) lighter, thinner, and more compact overall. On the outside, the ps3 is now a flat black color, which is great for reducing unsightly finger prints. The buttons are no longer touch style (i was disappointed) and are now replaced with regular clicking buttons. <br /><br />The power scource is much more energy efficient and once you turn it in it actually feels smoother (and quiter) running then the original ps3. I also noticed my slim is much quiter, my original is at least twice as loud as the slim. Both systems play all PS3 games and bluray movies (bluray movies look amazing off the ps3 if you have the right HD equipment!) Some of the older PS3 systems are backwards compatible, the slim is not. So if your dying to play a collection of ps2 games you have, you might wanna go for an older systme that is backwards compatible. But im sure once you start playing ps3 games, you'll totally forget about your PS2 collection! <br /><br />Inside the ps3 slim is also a HUGE fan...(google it there's plenty of pictures# and thats likely what keeps it cool despite its compact figure. Even after playing some long runs on my ps3 slim, there's not more of a heat output then my orignal. PS3's dont really having a heating problem, leave that to the XBOX 360s. I do have one tip though, some ps3 slim users have been experiencing problems and saying their PS3 slims run hot. To prevent this, look at the power cable, on both ends there is white text on the actual cable, make sure on the side going in the ps3 and in the outlet, that the white text is facing upwards. I have NO clue why this is but it does run cooler when its put that way.<br /><br />Games are quite amazing and ps3 gameplay doesn't change from the orignal to the slim except for the fact that my ps3 slim loads maybe a second or two faster then my original. Online gaming is still the same, lag-free and fast if you have a high speed connection! #TIP: configure your router if you can to let your ps3 have priority on bandwith, it helps especially when downloading 1GB+ demo's) <br /><br />Hard drive swapping is still a breeze. A screw here and there and you just pop out the old one and in with the new! My original ps3 is running a 320gb Western Digital drive. If your looking for an adequate sized drive i recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011U65F2">Western Digital 320GB Scorpio Blue SATAII 5400RPM 2.5IN 8MB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive WD3200BEVT</a> You can get them for easily under $70 now, i've seen them as low as $50. It runs pretty cool and has lasted

From the 360 to PS3
I've had a 360 for over 2 years and am currently on on my 3rd. The first two had to be replaced, for free, after the RRoD. The DVD player on my latest 360 died and I didn't want to pay to have it repaired so I did it myself. And yes, I modded it. It only cost $50 to replace the DVD player and everything was just dandy. Borderlands came out and I wanted to play the game online with some work friends, so I coughed up the money for XBox live. Almost a week to the day of buying XBL my console got banned from XBL for being modded. Of course we were offered no refund for XBL. Needless to say I was a bit ticked off. I wouldn't have had to mod my 360 if they'd just build a solid device, but I was 0 for 3 on 360 consoles and just didn't want to spend the time and money shipping the thing out for repairs for the third time in less than 3 years. So I retired the 360 to the confines of storage and bought a PS3.<br /><br />I got the Slim and so far so good. The console is much quieter than the 360 and the foot print is a lot smaller than the 360. I traded in all my 360 games and stocked up on my staples, Bioshock, Assians Creed, Dragon Age etc. <br /><br />For me personally I find the failure rate of the 360s to be unacceptable. Most of the people I work with have both a 360 and PS3 and most of them are on their second or third 360, it's just a piece of junk in my opinion. So moving up to a PS3 buys me a bit more security in the fact that this device will perform and not die every year as the 360s do.

The best value for the price
Many of the other 4 and 5 star reviews have hit on the main points of this new PS3, yes its smaller, thiner and quiter then the previous model but what is lost on new buyers is how big of a deal this all is. When you read about the PS3 slim and its features it makes you think that the original PS3 must have been some poorly designed mess, when that could not be further from the truth. Part of what makes the new PS3 so amazing is that Sony was able to take all the great features of the PS3 like Blu-ray, WiFi, Free On line gaming, mind blowing graphics (from Sony's first party titles anyway), Full 1080p HD and HDMI and shrink it down to this size in just under 3 years. The PS3 was always a great value its just now an even greater value in a smaller more energy efficent package. The new exterior design is great as well, the mostly matte finish keeps finger prints and dust from being a eyesore while still adding subtle touches like back lit power and eject buttons that have hidden LED's when in use. The over all design is very user frinedly, and makes it easier to touch and use the system.<br /><br />Also when compairing both HD consoles the PS3 becomes an even bigger value:<br /><br />PS3 - 299.99 comes with:<br /><br />Blu-ray - standard<br /><br />HDMI 1.3 - standard<br /><br />Hard Drive - standard and fully/easily upgraded with any Laptop hard drive<br /><br />WiFi - Standard<br /><br />Wireless rechargeable bluetooth controller - standard<br /><br />Network gaming access - Free<br /><br />now compare Xbox 360 (black model, white arcade unit is further stripped down)<br />Blu-ray - NOT AVAILABLE<br /><br />HDMI - Standard on newer models<br /><br />Hard Drive - Standard on black units $80 to $180 extra for White Arcade units, not upgradeable with anything but Microsoft branded Hard drives.<br /><br />WiFi - $80 to $100 extra<br /><br />Wireless controller - Yes but the controller DOES NOT come with a recharageable battery, so add an aditional $20 to $30 for rechargeable battery and device to recharge it(depending on which option you choose)<br /><br />Network Gaming Access - 49.99 a year for gold membership otherwise you can not access content or play most games online.<br /><br />Do the math, PS3 costs 299.99 and includes everything you need to get started.<br /> Xbox 360 costs $480.00 to $500.00 just to offer SOME of what the PS3 does right out of the box at no aditional cost to you. Then factor in that the 360 will NEVER be able to play Blu-ray movies and that the hardware is still unreliable. In this economy getting more for less is important and the PS3 has that in spades.<br /><br />

Awesome Blu-ray disc player (That happens to be a great gaming system, too)
You'll have to pardon me if I gush, but this was a major upgrade from both my previous game system and previous DVD player. We finally made the leap to our first HDTV, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UVEZFE">Samsung LN46B750 46-Inch 1080p 240 Hz LCD HDTV with Charcoal Grey Touch of Color</a>, and after watching a few DVDs on our old player it became obvious that getting a real Blu-ray player was an absolute necessity. <br />I initially purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TK3D4A">Samsung BD-P1600 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player</a> because it was built to communicate directly with our TV. The Samsung Blu-ray player was a significant leap over our old DVD player, but only when playing BDs - on DVDs it left a lot to be desired.<br />My wife bought into the concept of getting the PS3 because of the high praise it gets as a BD player. All of the earlier concerns about noise from the fan, etc. seem to have been resolved. As a BD/DVD player, the thing is aweseome. I had to do some tweaking of the settings to get it to send an HDMI signal to the TV and a digital audio signal to the amp (next on the list of things to upgrade), and I get the feeling that I'm only using about 15% of the available functionality - but that functionality is, again, awesome.<br />Some key pros: <br />- The PS3 has visibly better upscaling on DVDs than the Samsung. <br />- Streaming Netflix over the PS3 is easy-as-pie. Unfortunate that it requires an extra BD from Netflix, and hopefully Sony will come up with a firmware update sooner than later. But for the time being it is pretty painless to simply put the BD in (it's also an easier way to get to that part of the menu for my wife).<br />- Setting the PS3 to communicate with my TV was easy. Not automatic, but easy.<br />- Games look incredible in full HD. Ridiculous. My wife walked in while I was playing Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time and asked me what movie I was watching. I've only logged about 6 hours of game time, so I don't have much experience with the PS3 to draw from. In that 6 hours I've managed to get characters stuck twice, eliminating my hopes for "perfect" gameplay, but I'm still blown away.<br />- Easy to connect to wireless network. It only took a few minutes to get the PS3 hooked up to our wireless network, even though we have our connection password protected.<br /><br />Some key cons:<br />- Sony doesn't include detailed instructions on how to use the controller as a BD remote. As a lifelong gamer I was able to fake the funk through most of it, but I was frustrated by my lack of control over BD playback. I broke down and spent the $20 on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M17AVO">Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote</a> and it made a world of difference.<br />- When set to interface with the TV it is impossible to turn the PS3 on without forcing the TV to switch over to that input. And since it isn't a Samsung product, when I power the PS3 down the TV doesn't automatically switch back to the satellite input. Not Sony's fault, obviously, but it did that with the Samsung BD player.<br />- Slow load time of games. Getting a game started is a 2-minute endeavor, which isn't a long time when you're riding a bus but is an eternity when you don't get much time to game in the day.<br />- Internet browsing: you can browse the Internet via the PS3, but without a wireless keyboard it is challenging, and surfing the web on my TV just gives me bad flashbacks to WebTV of the late 90's.<br /><br />Overall, we absolutely *love* the PS3. Now that we have the basics covered I'm starting to branch out and research all of the machine's capabilities. But the thing it does really well, that got it in the door of our house, is play Blu-ray discs and DVDs.

Upgrade Complete
I FINALLY upgraded to a PS3 this Christmas and I am incredibly happy I did.  While I have always and WILL always love my PS2 I had to see what the PS3 was all about.<br /><br />The new system offers so many applications and possibilities that the PS2 never could.  The online system is fun, though I don't use it as often as many do.  I enjoy being able to surf the net and have direct play from Netflix.  I also love the PlayStation store for upgrades for certain games.<br /><br />The size of the console seemed normal to me, though many still complain that it's large.  The PS2 wasn't the smallest console and this model is no different.  The Slim model is obviously smaller and uses far less energy than the larger PS3.  It doesn't make a sound while running.  There's no sound of fans, lasers moving, etc.<br /><br />I would have to say my favorite addition is the wireless controller.  I love that you can turn the console on and off through the controller and that some games (such as "Lair") use the Sixaxxis to it's fullest capacity.  My only complaint would be how you charge them.  If you don't spend the money on a charging pad you have to use a short USB cable that comes with the console.  While you can still play a game while charging you have to sit close enough so you don't pull it off your TV.<br /><br />The graphics on the PS3 are wonderful.  Every game I've played (Assassin's Creed 1 & 2, Eternal Sonata, Lair, Little Big Planet, etc.) are beautifully created with graphics that often suggest they could step out of your screen they look so real.  The sound if also amazing.<br /><br />The only other complaint I would have about the PS3 Slim is it's matte finish.  I do appreciate that it doesn't collect fingerprints like the larger models shines finish did, but the new finish is textured and therefore holds dust way too well.<br /><br />Overall the PS3 gets 5/5 stars.  I would rate it higher if I could.  I have been completely happy with the new console and often wonder what the heck took me so long when it came to buying it...oh...that's right...it used to cost $600.

Been there.  Done that.  Got the RRoD.
Alright, I'll keep this semi-short since there are plenty of good reviews for the PS3.  I've personally, as of now, owned all consoles of this current generation.  <br /><br />Wii - Great fun for the first few months, I sold it because I just couldn't find any more enjoyment out of it.  It's great for families, but for an average 20-something with nothing to do there isn't a whole lot going for it.<br /><br />XBox 360 - I have to admit I loved a lot of the XBox exclusives that are available and XBox Live is definitely ahead of the game as far as DLC and media are concerned.  However, the hardware is barely sub-par.  I went through 3 cycles of the infamous 'red ring of death' on the same system.  The quality of the hardware should exceed the quality of the software in all respects to give the customer a sense of pride in what they're purchasing.  No BD playback.  Pay-to-play/communicate with other users.  Constant battery replacements without built-in rechargables.  The list goes on and on.<br /><br />Finally, with warranty money from my XBox 360 and Amazon trade-in gift cards from my games I went with the console I should've bought 3 years ago - The PS3.<br /><br />I've only played a few games thus far, but they all appear staggeringly better defined on BD as opposed to the standard DVD format that is currently being used by the other guys.  I'm not a big fan of 'Playstation Home', but I understand it's currently in beta.  Also the PSN has a lot to make up for, but it's free.  Controllers are rechargeable via USB and have a better feel, in my opinion, than the XBox 360 controller.  The PS3 also has built-in wifi, not a proprietary accessory.  BD playback, Netflix streaming, better hardware, and increasing better software.  So far it's been a win-win with my PS3.

Excellent entertainment system!
I love our PS3.  I used our computer for gaming before but decided to give one of these a try as it is very expensive to put a good gaming system together only for them to up gaming requirements.  This system is amazing.  The games are awesome but I tell you we use it as much for movies as we do games.  We loved the blu ray player and watching the movies in pristine HD and that was great but then we discovered Netflix Watch Instantly and realized how much we've been missing.  There is so much to watch on there its incredible.  My personal favorite is the Rockford Files series I used to watch as a kid. You wont get this with XBox...unless you pay for their gold membership.  <br />This isnt a very indepth review but I wanted to point out how much there is to do on this system.  Its much more than games!  Get one and enjoy! <br />

PS3 Slim Delivers!
Perfect Xmas present for my family!<br />Of course, I had to try it out to make sure<br />it works. I've been trying it out probably <br />way too much since I purchased Guitar Hero<br />World Tour more recently. I originally bought <br />PS3 for games for my son when he visits, and<br />because it had Blue-ray for my wife & I.<br />Turned into my new toy, & hard to put down. <br />Works great with our new LG HDTV!<br />Delivered promptly and way worth the money!<br />Highly recommended.

Think of it as a Blu-Ray player that can be used for games
A PlayStation 3 is a Blu-Ray player, a music player, a video disc player, and many other things. Oh, yea: and you can play games on it. What more do you need?

Get ready to rumble, even with PS 2 games!
I was already extremely happy with the Sixaxis controller, but I could not resist getting the DualShock 3. Not only do you get the rumble, but also, it feels much better in your hands, even for those games that do not use this feature. The rumble function is fun, but on top of that, it helps with gameplay, because "feeling" what is happening provides a lot more feedback than just watching how your character or car reacts to the environment. <br /><br />The biggest surprise of all was that the rumble works with PS 2 games in the PS 3 system. I am currently playing through "God of War", a game which had the rumble capability in PS 2. I thought that it was unlikely that I was going to get this feature with this new controller in the PS 3, but it worked perfectly.<br /><br />I know that having to buy a new controller and basically discard the one that came with the system is not the ideal situation, but I have to say this product is really worth shedding the extra bucks.

Tested on Playstation 1, 2, and 3 games - it works GREAT on all of them!
Well folks, now that the dust has settled from the Sony vs. Immersion lawsuit, Playstation 3 owners are finally able to feel the vibe again!<br /><br />I purchased this controller today and I knew the only way to properly road-test it was on the game that made the Dualshock famous, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001X50M">Metal Gear Solid</a>. After booting up the game, I walked down the hallway and got spotted by a guard. As he shouted, "WHO'S THAT?" the controller jumped in my hand - and I knew this was a smart purchase. As the guards shot at me, I felt the feedback of the bullets, just as I had 10 years ago on my Sony Playstation.<br /><br />I picked out another old school Playstation game, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000I1BG">Tenchu: Stealth Assassins</a>. From Ayame's blades to Rikimaru's sword, each sword swipe and jump had excellent feedback.<br /><br />Okay, so my Playstation games worked out. But what about my Playstation 2 library?<br /><br />I popped in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XL3BA">God of War</a>, knowing I had to feel the swing of the Blades of Chaos. The controller vibrations felt a little lighter here, but the vibrations still occurred at the appropriate times.<br /><br />Then I chose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OSLAA">Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction</a>. Who better to test a vibration controller than the Sultan of Smash? All the power jumps and smashes had the vibrations intact, but they still felt a little on the light side.<br /><br />All right, so far I was two for two with my Playstation and Playstation 2 test subjects. But what about my Playstation 3 games? Could I possibly hit a trifecta?<br /><br />I put in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UW21A0">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a> and I decided to jump right into a heated firefight. The controller gave me feedback while shooting weapons and getting hit by enemy fire, but I knew my purchase was justified when Drake was near death: I FELT THE DUALSHOCK 3 PULSING IN SYNCH WITH DRAKE'S HEARTBEAT. It's one thing to hear that noise and know he's near death, it's quite another to feel the pulse in my own hands.<br /><br />Okay, so the feedback on the older games was there, but a little lighter than I remember. The reason? Well, when I decided to go wireless on my Playstation 2 system, I bought a Logitec Dualshock controller. It turns out, that controller takes two "AA" batteries, and the vibration motors inside the controller handles are slightly larger than the ones in the Dualshock 3. That's where I felt the difference.<br /><br />The Dualshock 3 vibrations may be slightly less than the Logitec controller, but it doesn't require the purchase of batteries. <br />The Dualshock 3 may be slightly heavier than the SixAxis, but it doesn't take up any extra space at all.<br /><br />Sure, the price is about $15 more than the SixAxis, but it's a worthy upgrade for the Playstation 3 gamer who kicks it old school as well as new school. The only other drawback is the lack of an additional USB cable - but we can use the one that came with the system itself.<br /><br />So what's the final verdict?<br /><br />Order it, plug it in, charge it up, and get ready for the inevitable downloads from the Playstation Store to make the older PS3 games Dualshock 3 compatible. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend a feedback peripheral without providing my own feedback...<br /><br />Enjoy!

Should've been rumble from the start.
The Playstation 2's highly regarded DualShock 2 controller was considered by many to be the best videogame controller of all time.  So when you've got a winning design there's no need to change anything.  However, because of a legal battle with Immersion over rumble technology, Sony was forced to offer their Sixaxis controller without rumble.  The Sixaxis had the same Dualshock design but it felt too lightweight and cheap.  Thankfully the lawsuit has been settled and rumble has come back to the Playstation.<br /><br />For the most part, the DualShock 3 is almost identical to its PS2 precessor.  But it has all the features of the original Sixaxis controller in addition to rumble.  The controller is still wireless, can be charged by plugging it into your PS3 (or PC), rumble is compatible with all PS1 and PS2 games, and the PS3 supports up to 7 controllers at the same time via bluetooth.  Rumble in the DualShock 3 seems more responsive in regards to the location of its vibration depending on which side you get hit on during the games.  I don't know if this is something in the design or if it's the developers doing it for the games but I welcome it.<br /><br />All in all this is currently the best designed controller on the market right now.  The PS2's DS2 was incredible so "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here.  I'll be enjoying rumble in my PS3 games from now on.

Welcome to the Rumble.
For the past year and a half something has been missing. You don't know what it is but theirs a void and somehow you want to fill it if only you could figure out what it is. You've played Resistance, Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, and Uncharted but something doesn't feel the same. Well worry no more your fears can now be relieved. Rumble is back to bring many of the PS3 best games to life. Granted we shouldn't have had to wait for this controller and its been a painful wait for Sony to settle the lawsuit and get the dualshock 3 into our gamer hands. But at least now its here and without it your truly missing out on that last bit of immersion games have been giving us for many years now.<br /><br />Its not a new feature, of course, but its a necessary one. As a PS3 owner I've missed it and I've taken issue with Sony leaving it out of the sixaxis. No we can have our rumble and feel it too. The controller has a great weighty feel to it. Still includes the motion sensing of the original sixaxis controller. The rumble works on all of the best games, except for Call of Duty 4 but I'm sure a patch will be available in the future. You really can't ask for more. Its rechargable without the need to buy anything extra. Consider all the batteries you don't have to buy and it pays for itself.

Worth the money
This is the controller you should have if you love PS3. I imported one months ago and have loved it. Made Resistance Fall of Man way more fun to play since the rumble puts you more into the game. Drakes Fortune is totally programed around it. Also the sixaxis functions seems more refined in this controller. I noticed it when playing Lair.

Best Controller Ever Made in My Opinion
Honestly, words cannot say how much more I love this controller compared to the Sixaxis wireless controller for the PS3. I actually got my DualShock 3 imported from Japan back in February and have used it all the time on my PS3. I have only played with the Dual Shock for PS2 and PS1 games though and not PS3 games yet since I only have 2 games that do not support rumble for the system. I can say that the Rumbling feature is 100% the same as the Dual Shock 2 for the PS2! <br /><br />First off, the weight difference is significant compared to the Sixaxis. You can tell no doubt which controller is which once you pick up both a Sixaxis and Dual Shock 3.<br /><br />Second, they now have 3 different colors for the controller which is pretty sweet cause now you can buy the controller in Silver, Black, and White.<br /><br />Now, to review on the rumbling itself, well, IT'S AWESOME!!! It's 100% accurate once something happens in a game where the controller is supposed to rumble and it gives you that feeling of awesomeness when playing games that have the rumble feature.<br /><br />The ONLY con I have to say about this controller is that sometimes it can drain the battery a bit quickly, but hey, I would take this controller 100 times as much compared to the Sixaxis.<br /><br />Overall, no doubt this product deserves 100 stars, but I can only give it 5.

Very Happy
What a great addition to an already great system.  Have had the PS3 since it came out.  Got my new DualShock controller today and immedately played ToyHome 2nd Gear.  <br /><br />The new controller is very nice with this game.  When your car or runs into something, you can really tell!<br /><br />I also like the fact the controller is a little heavier.  I think it makes turning the cards a little more realistic<br /><br />

Excellent Controller, but Slightky Different From What I Expected
This is regarding the Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller for PS3.  Let's start off with the fact that the controller works great.  It's got a slightly duller finish versus the original that came with my PS3, and it's lighter as well.  Light doesn't mean cheap though, as I've been using it for about 3 weeks straight with no ill effects.  There's only one caveat though, being that it didn't come with a mini-USB cable like the original controller did(shipped in the box).  Obviously I already had a cable, it's just that there was no mention of this on the Amazon page before I purchased it.  Other than that, I'm extremely satisfied.

Wireless Perfection
If you've used a Sony Playstation at any point over the last 10 or so years you pretty much know what to expect with the Dualshock 3. The size, shape and layout of the DS3 is almost identical to the original Dualshock controller that was released for the Playstation 1. Chances are if you liked using any of the previous Sony brand controllers you'll also enjoy using the Dualshock 3. Similarly, if any of the previous Dualshock controllers weren't quite right for you then you'll probably dislike the DS3. <br /><br />Slight changes have been made to the shoulder buttons and the addition of a'PS' button allows for quick start-up and shutdown of the PS3 as well as access to the PS3 X-Cross Media Bar. <br /><br />The L2 & R2 shoulder buttons are now less 'button' and more 'trigger'. Personally I'm mixed on the new layout. The trigger design works great in certain games such as racing games; but can be less than perfect for platforming or action games. <br /><br />The DS3 features the exact same motion sensitivity featured in the Sony SIXAXIS controller for the PS3. The major addition of the DS3 being the rumble feature. In using the DS3 for approximately 6 months it has become my controller of choice. Simply put the DS3 offers a level of immersion into games that the SIXAXIS cannot offer. The actual amount of rumble varies from game to game and many games even offer the ability to adjust the rumble feedback. <br /><br />Also improved over the SIXAXIS is the feel of the DS3 controller. Because of the added weight afforded by the rumble mechanism the DS3 feels heavier and more appropriate than the lightweight SIXAXIS. <br /><br />Because the DS3 is wireless it relies on a built-in battery to power the controller. Battery life is comparable to that afforded by the SIXAXIS which is approximately 8-10 hours. In my experience charging the DS3 to a full charge takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br /><br />The DS3 relies on Blutooth technology to power the wireless feature. Range is excellent and advertised to be about 30ft. Suffice to say that I've never experienced a problem with regards to wireless range. <br /><br />All told the DS3 is the premier Playstation controller. Well built and sturdy the controller will last through many gaming sessions. I highly recommend the DS3 to any gamer.

Solid Red Plastic Looks Great
I was so pleased to learn that Sony resolved their legal issue with "Dual Shock" rumble.  Now this feels so much like the controller I have grown used to.  It has a good weight to it now and the rumble and new six axis features work very well together.  Actually I had a Wii and the six axis features of the Wiimote (like in MarioKart) seem to be not as precise or user friendly as Sony's are.<br /><br />As for the red color, I was worried it was painted, but no the plastic is through and through red, solid red.  And the red is the God of War red (in my opinion) so it is pleasant on the eye.<br /><br />I am still not very pleased with the L3 and R3 buttons, they feel awkward, but I couldn't really tell you how to better implement these extra buttons either.

It's a controller, what can you say?
The dualshock Playstation controller has been my favorite controller design since it first came out for the PS1. Now that it is wireless with the PS3 it is even better. Nothing bad to say about it.

you get what you pay for
this controller works perfectly. i recently purchased a much less expensive controller from a supposedly good source only to find it was different than expected and did not work well with my console. the controller that i purchased from amazon is the factory original replacement, made to work with my system, and it works flawlessly. to really save money, buy the correct item the first time for a really good price.

Solid Controller, My Personal Favorite Controller of All Time
When Sony came into the video game scene many years ago with the PSX aka PSOne, they created one of the best controllers ever made.  The shoulder buttons are very comfortable and easy to press within a split second, great for games that require fast reaction time.  The four face buttons are spaced perfectly, and the overall design of the controller fits the hand perfectly.  Sony hit the bulls-eye with the PSOne Dualshock controller, and they transferred this design over to the PS2.  The design was still so popular that Sony could not resist transferring it over again.  The added benefit of the dualshock controller on the PS3 is the added freedom of wireless.<br /><br />The controller is easy to adapt to for Sony console veterans, making the upgrade to the PlayStation 3 even less painless then it already is.  The PlayStation 3 sticks to Sony's winning formula, utilizing familiar buttons, and the same layout as controllers before it.  Players will easily recognize the mapping of the controllers, with trademark "square", "triangle", "circle" and "x" buttons that Sony fans have become accustomed to.  The PlayStation 3 also follows the tried and true method of the Xbox 360 controller by placing a "home" icon on the controller.  The "home" icon is located in the center of the controller, and upon pressing it the player will view the PlayStation 3 XMB.  The XMB is the main navigational source for the PS3, displaying the contents of the console's hard-drive and disc-drive.  Holding the button down for a longer period of time will allow either the controller or the console to be turned off remotely.<br /><br />The controller easily syncs with the console and has a great battery life as well.  The controller also comes packaged with a USB cable that you can use to charge the controller with in case of long gaming sessions where the battery may begin to run low.  The only drawback with this is the length of cable is not long enough to actually allow the gamer to sit at a decent distance from the console while charging the controller.  Replacing and upgrading the chord with one of a better length is a wise choice, and one that I highly recommend.  <br /><br />The Dualshock 3 returns to the heavier weight that players are used to feeling from the controllers; ditching the lightweight design of the Six Axis.  This makes the controller "feel" better to hold, making it sturdier as well.  The major reason that I prefer this controller overall the other controllers that have been released is because of the directional pad.  The d-pad is perfect on the Sony controllers.  It allows for precision and accuracy in every genre of gaming.  I was disappointed when Sony launched the PS3 and its controller lacked rumble capability, however, with this new release the Dualshock design is back and better than ever.

New Colors Options Amazing
I purchased both the Red color and the Blue Color (at the time of this writing only the blue one has arrived).<br /><br />I must say that the Metallic Blue Dual Shock 3 looks more impressive in person than the image seems to convey.  The image doesnt convey the fact that it is metallic blue.  Metallic blue in this case means that the actually controlloer looks almost nearly like a dark shade of blue but has the "subtle sparks" in it that makes it shimmer and shine when one rotates it around in the lighting.<br /><br />Performance wise it is the same that we expect with all of our DualShock 3's.  Perfect feel for comfort, strong vibrant vibration, and great sixaxis motion control translation (on games that support them). <br /><br />The only other minor thing is that the "DualShock 3" logo and the "Sixaxis" logo are in a brighter blue on that front end of the DualShock 3.  I dont think it adds or distracts from the aesthetics since it is in an odd position on the DualShock 3 for this Metallic Blue color.<br /><br />EDIT:  Deep Red Color arrived today and it looks exactly like the picture.  Saying deep red is quite a stretch for it is a brilliant red but doesnt look quite luminous. <br /><br /><br />These are a worthwhile purchase if you want to add a DualShock 3 color other than Black to your collection.

Perfect.
Again...not much more detail I can provide in a review....<br />These are the real deal and built well by Sony.<br />Amazon pricing is much better then retail...and with low shipping costs and savings on TAX...this is the place to buy em.<br />

Works like the Dualshock 2 but wireless
This is a sturdy controller made by Sony, and is the official controller.  It is bluetooth, syncs instantly, and works with all games.  Not all games will be dualshock vibration compatible, but the controller works with all games on the PS3.  <br /><br />When playing vibration intensive games like Call of Duty World at War, you will feel how great and powerful the vibration is.  The constant gunfire will vibrate till your hands get numb. <br /><br /> If you are looking to get another PS3 controller, get the Sony made one.  It's trusted, and guaranteed to work.

Classics die hard
Who didn't cringe a bit when Sony unveiled the unsightly, boomerang controller with the PS3, oh so many years ago?  So when it was revealed that the controller was going to be the same shape & function as the DualShock 2, I let out a huge sigh of relief.  But my relief was tempered by the announcement that there was to be no 'shock' in the new wireless controller.  "Oh well," I thought, "At least it still 'looks' like the dual shock."  But then I heard that the reason for no 'shock' was that it wasn't compatible with the sixaxis feature.  Now I'm no electronics engineer, but I know enough to know that there are ways to counter such incompatibilities.  <br /><br />I thought correctly when they released the DualShock 3, Sony's next gen gamer's Excalibur.  Same awesome design that fits oh so perfectly in my hand, same game enhancing vibration function as the DS2, and now with the sixaxis control feature & it's wireless!  What more do I need to say about it?  Sure there are other after market controllers out there for less money, but why?

Rumble is Back !!
Finally the dualshock is back, and this time better than ever (wireless, with sixaxis). There is no doubt the rumble adds alot of fun to gameplay. The controller itself is heavier and feels just right. I didn't notice any problems in battery life, got about 8 hours so far and still has full bars. This also works with all PS1/PS2 games (requires firmware 2.00).  I tried this with uncharted and warhawk so far, both games uses the rumble feature perfectly.  Even though i beat uncharted already, this time i really found it a lot better with rumble. I reccomend this for all PS3 owners, and especially if you're getting the one and only MGS4.

This is a  very good, good, good controller

Rumble, The ONLY Way To Go!
I just got my Dualshock 3 Controller today and let me tell you it was everything I had hoped for! The weight is so much better than the Sixaxis Controller, I feel like im holding a real controller not a lite weight piece of junk. As for the Rumble Feature.... it's Perfect! It Added so much more of a connection to the game when I was playing Warhawk today, feeling the recoil of the weapons really gave me a rush and also let me know what I was missing without the Rumble Feature. In Short don't waste time, go drop the $55.00 and get what you should of when you first purchased your PS3!

Supersized Slim - consider the alternatives
&lt; BEGIN REVIEW ><br /><br />Briefly, the PS3-250 is the exact original PS3 'Slim' with a twice as large hard disk.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to actually see and use a PS3-250 on the Sunday prior to its launch. As I expected, the only difference between the ps3-250 and the PS3-120 is the larger disk with everything else the same. Many reviews of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J4VQ">PS3-120 are HERE</a>.<br /><br />&lt; END OF REVIEW ><br /><br /><br /><br />Once the decision was made to get a PS3, 2 important questions might be:<br /><br />- Which model to buy? PS3-120 or PS3-250?<br /><br />- To upgrade or not to upgrade to a 500/640GB PS3?<br /><br />Based on personal experience and the experience of other PS3 owners that I know, the options are the following - remember, these are my views:<br /><br /><br /><br />PS3-120, no upgrade<br />---------------------<br />Buy a PS3-120 and do not upgrade if you use it mainly to play movies and you rarely download games from the PSN store. It will take you very far and it should have sufficient room for storing thousands of pictures and a lot of music besides it playing Blu-ray content and CDs.<br /><br />I found that 120GB would not be enough for me. After a couple of years of use, with a few downloaded games, many more demos, lots of pictures and songs and some videos the kids made with the PS3 Eye we've breached the 120GB threshold. I would not worry about that if all I wanted was one of the better Blu-ray players. In addition, anybody comfortable with backing up/restoring the PS3 and upgrading the disk can postpone the upgrade step for later.<br /><br /><br />PS3-250, no upgrade<br />---------------------<br />Buy a PS3-250 and do not upgrade if you do plan to download a few movies and games but not a lot of them AND/or you don't feel comfortable with upgrading your PS3 yourself.<br /><br />Anyone who is not an almost-exclusive movie viewer and doesn't want to mess with screws and OEM disks should buy the PS3-250. It should have enough capacity to last for quite a few years with good disk space management (delete the demos and downloads you no longer need).<br /><br /><br />PS3-120 upgrade to 500/640GB<br />------------------------------<br />Buy a PS3-120 and upgrade it to 500/640GB IF you don't mind swapping the PS3's disk. You get to upgrade your PS3-120 to quadruple capacity for very little expense and probably for less than a PS3-250 would cost you (see next paragraph). This should buy you peace of mind for the rest of your PS3's lifespan.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a 500GB HDD such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023MYNCE">500GB Scorpio Blue Mobile Sata 5400RPM 8MB 2.5IN</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P3KO8I">Western Digital 640 GB SATA OEM Notebook Hard Drive WD6400BEVT (Scorpio Blue)</a> if you don't mind the extra expense can be had for about 90 dollars at the time I am writing this. That would make a 500GB upgraded PS3-120 appear a little more expensive than the PS3-250 BUT you are left with a brand-new 120GB HDD (the drive originally in the PS3) when you are done and you can either sell it or use it as an external USB-powered backup drive or maybe to upgrade your laptop's drive. This would effectively set the price of the 500GB upgraded console to match that of the PS3-250.<br /><br />There are many online guides that detail the process. I will post a couple URL's in a comment to this review.<br /><br /><br />PS3-250 upgrade to 500/640GB (not recommended)<br />------------------------------------------------<br />Do NOT buy a PS3-250 if you are planning to upgrade it to 500/640GB unless you really need a spare 250GB external HDD instead of a spare 120GB HDD and think that the price difference is worth the larger spare drive.<br /><br /><br /><br />EVALUATION<br /><br />The PS3-250 while not for everyone, deserves its 5 stars. In my view, there is enough value added by doubling the storage capacity to justify the price difference over the PS3-120.<br /><br /><br />______________________________________<br /><br />NOTE: If you want to upgrade you are better off if you upgrade immediately.<br /><br />This way you avoid the backup/restore hassles and therefore greatly simplify the process. I would include the upgrade HDD on the same order with the new PS3 and maybe add a HDD enclosure if planning to use the drive I removed from the PS3 as an external drive.

250 vs. 120 PS3
I had no idea which unit to buy, the 120 or the 250 GB Playstation 3.  I ended up with the 250 out of fear that the 120 would leave me desiring more space later.  If you don't know anything, here is what I see so far.  On the Playstation network, you can download game demos and marketing videos for games free.  I haven't found myself doing this a lot yet.  Of course, you can also delete them easily after you watch them.<br /><br />Most playable games even old ones cost to download so I have decided to just buy a couple of the popular ones and am hooked on those and the stunning DVD and Blu Ray movie quality for now.  You are not going to be able to download games like Modern Warefare 2 to your hard drive from the PS network that I can see.  WHen you buy a game at the store or here on amazon in disc format, you have to install it first.  This may take some hard drive space.  So far, one game I have takes nearly 3 GB and another takes up less than 1 GB but the games also called for an update download which I don't know how much space that took.  At this rate, you could install maybe 100 store bought disc format games.  <br /><br />Playing movies on disc doesn't seem to take hard drive space.  You can download movies from the Playstation network.  If you do much of this, I image you'll need more space but the movies I was interested in cost the same amount to buy from amazon or wal-mart as to download so if you can wait to go to the store or recieve a package, you don't need to download it.  You can rent movies also.  I imagine this is a download that is disabled after a time period or after it is viewed or something.  You can also download TV shows like "The Office" for $2 an eposode.  If you want to do a lot of that, maybe the bigger HD is a good idea.<br /><br />I am thinking you would do well with just the 120GB unless you know you are going to make a collection of movies and TV shows and low priced downloadable games on your Playstation.<br /><br />You can also save photos on the Playstation as well as video.  If this is part of your plan, well again more space may help.  The PS3 has USB ports where I believe you could load photos and home movies from to view on your TV.<br /><br />You can also access your applications on the www like facebook.<br /><br />Bare in mind that there are a lot of folkes out there with older PS3's that have only 40 and 80 GB drives who love their playstation and don't feel the need for the 250 GB drive.<br /><br />I don't feel upset that I spent the extra $50 to get the larger drive because it might be useful later, but if I knew then what I know now, I would have been comfortable buying the 120 for my purposes which is playing a small number of games (not a small amount of time, just a small number of games because they cost a lot) and watching some Blu Ray movies.<br /><br />If you still find it hard to make a decision, ask yourself if you want to spend more money because both models are the same except the HD size which you can upgrade later.  By the time you buy the unit, HD cable, a game, maybe another controller and remote control for Blu Ray, you'll be in deep on the expense and maybe another $50 isn't acceptable.<br /><br />It is a very good and fun product.  After I spent all the money on what I needed, I debated on hooking it up or sending it back because it was a lot of money; I'm very glad I hooked it up and delt with the expense.  It is everything I hoped.

Great value, great upgrade
Hi there,<br /><br />Let me give you some background: <br /><br />I purchased a PS3 60 GB model at launch back in November 2006.  I have loved everything about it ever since.  I even upgraded the hard drive to a 250 GB hard drive about a year and a half ago.<br /><br />Why did I choose to purchase this new, slim, 250 GB model?<br /><br />Honestly, it's a great deal for what you get.  It's cooler (temperature wise), more energy efficient, and it takes up MUCH less space than my previous model.  (Not to mention the much nicer, matte black finish as opposed to the older piano black finish which is a scratch/fingerprint magnet.)<br /><br />Thinking about the new 120 GB vs. this 250 GB model?  Maybe this will help:<br /><br />Originally, I had planned to buy the 120 GB model and upgrade to a 250 GB or 320 GB hard drive myself.  However, at the $349.99 price point, there's no need to perform the upgrade myself.  For a quality Western Digital or Seagate 250 GB hard drive, you'll be spending anywhere from $50 to $70 plus shipping and/or tax, and for a 320 GB hard drive you'll be spending upwards of $75.  Honestly, there really isn't any reason for that with this model.  Why go through the hassle when Sony offers a great package at the perfect price point?<br /><br />I for one am happy with my purchase which I received today from Amazon and am happily inagurating it with the GI Joe: Rise of Cobra blu-ray.  For almost anyone that I can think of, the 250 GB hard drive will be more than enough space.  However, should the need arise in a year or two (or three), a 500 GB hard drive will be dirt cheap and easy enough to install.

Amazing - Perfect All In One
Prior to getting the PS3, we had a Sony BluRay player, an Apple TV and a PC hooked up to our Sony Bravia LCD TV.  PC was used for Netflix and backing up the Apple TV, Apple TV was used to rent and buy movies, and the Sony BluRay Player simply played BluRay DVDs.  After learning about the functionality of the PS3, I was sold.<br /><br />We've had it for about 2 weeks now and I am ever impressed with it's capabilities and quality.  Keep in mind, this is the first type of gaming system like this we've owned (we do have a Wii but I put this in a different class).  Here's my take on the various functions and their quality, smoothness and quickness of processing/playing.<br /><br />Gaming - Amazing quality with no hesitations at all (playing Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 2) and I've been playing quite a bit since we first got it.  Like the Wii, you can download old games like Mortal Kombat II and new ones for PS3 and the PSP.  Initially, I didn't think I was going to play that much but the graphics and the games have been really cool.  Not much of an online player at the moment but it seems that most have this option available.  Even Mortal Kombat II.  You can create user profiles on the PS3 which automatically link to saved game data.  Automatic and very nice. Create additional users so they can advance at their own pace.<br /><br />BluRay - Discs load quicker than the Sony BluRay player we bought about 9-12 months ago.  Thoroughly impressed with the quality of the picture.  You can also play older discs and they'll work just fine.<br /><br />Netflix - You'll need to get a disc from Netflix to be able to do this.  We've watched Instant Watch movies via PC/Internet on our TV and the quality wasn't too bad.  I say acceptable and sometimes the movie would freeze for a few seconds.  On average about two freezes per movie.  We were expecting the same thing via the PS3 but were dead wrong.  The quality is AMAZING and there has not been one hiccup in the video.  This really impressed us...and I'm a picky [...] so don't take that compliment lightly. :)<br /><br />Renting/Buying Movies/Shows via PlayStation Store - Lots of shows available for viewing, including the current season of whatever season you're into.  We don't rent these but it's nice to know we can in case the DVR gets goofed up for some reason.  As for movies, the files are larger compared to Apple TV/iTunes downloads but with this the quailty is much better.  HD movies are available but they're pretty big, about 6 GB!  If you're buying movies then it's worth the wait and the extra 5 dollars. SD movies are still good quality for basic rentals.  However, if you have a good cable connection you may want to rely on your On Demand Rentals to bypass waiting for long HD downloads.  Again, PS Store is good for purchases and I encourage it to save on materials/resources...go green where you can. :)  Only downfall with buying/renting movies this way is that the files don't have chapter markers so you can advance through sections of the movie like you can with a DVD. Hopefully they change this.<br /><br />Internet - If you need to access the web you can but you'll probably want to pick up the Logitech keyboard to do this.  The speed of browsing isn't too fast and the viewing area isn't the largest.  I'll walk over to my computer to do a search rather than use the PS3.<br /><br />Photos/Music - Depending on your computer setup (Mac or PC) you may need to get some additional software in order to turn your computer into a media server.  Then, through your wireless network you can access the music and play it through the PS3.  Same goes for photos...or you can load the photos onto the PS3 directly, same goes for the music.  Really amazing features but take a little research on what file formats are compatible, etc.<br /><br />PS3 Backup - With an external drive attached, you can back up the PS3, which is great.<br /><br />Overall, I say go for the 250GB if you're into being green like me and wish to download games, movies and load photos and music.  This device is truly an all-in-one and like I said, I'm picky.  Not to mention I understand technology pretty well.  If, after taking a realistic inventory, you will use all or the majority of the services, grab one of these suckers.  I'd also recommend going Sony for your TV and surround sound.  They all work really well together.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Blu-Ray, Netflix, Games, oh my!
By now, the PS3 has been extensively reviewed and this latest iteration (the "slim") has been out in the 120gb format for 2 months now (since September 1st, 2009).<br /><br />To summarize the benefits:<br />- Slimmer, lighter, and more energy efficient than the prior "fat" PS3<br />- Blu-ray player built-in<br />- Netflix streaming (yay!)<br />- Free online service (vs. subscription based X-box live)<br /><br />The negatives:<br />- No backwards compatibility with PS2 games<br />- Bluetooth remote only (and not included, so need to purchase <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M17AVO">a remote</a> to use as a dvd/blu-ray player, no IR (but a number of bluetooth-to-IR solutions like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267S7XW">Logitech Harmony Adapter</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AUG6OW">Infra-red to Bluetooth Adapter</a>)<br />- No more Linux support<br /><br />With Blu-ray player prices now dropping to the $100-$150 range, the PS3 makes for an expensive option as a Blu-ray player only.  As a home media center player/HTPC device, it really shines and is a great deal (you can't build a HTPC with a blu-ray player for less).  It IS somewhat limited, however, as a HTPC as its browser is not up to par.  Too bad Sony dropped linux support for the PS3.  The addition of Netflix streaming (currently requiring a disc but supposedly becoming native in a future firmware update) just ices this cake.<br /><br />edit to address the HD upgrade issue:<br />Yes, you can buy the 120gb for $50 less and, yes, you can install whatever capacity 2.5" hard drive you'd like fairly easily as long as you're willing to pay for a new hard drive.  BUT, considering that (1.) you'd still have to spend extra money (more than the $50 difference), (2.) spend time and effort to upgrade and (3.) you'd then have an extra 120gb hard drive afterwards to go through the hassle of ebaying (unless you turn it into another usb/backup drive--I've got too many as it is).  I find that it is just not worth it.  Spend the extra $50, get the 250gb installed by Sony and warrantied by Sony.

The PS3 does everything!!!
I originally wrote a review on the original 60 gb PS3 right after it launched in November, 2006. Like the original 60 gb the new PS3 slim 250 gb is almost as good once you get past its few flaws. The new Playstation 3 has the same specifications as the previous models, but it's 32% smaller, 36% lighter and 33% more energy-efficient than the regular Playstation 3. It sports a slightly different look and the touch buttons are now replaced with real buttons. I have to say the SONY Playstation 3 is one amazing system. With a 250 gb hard drive you will have plenty of memory to download a ton of stuff. One of the most welcome features is the PS3 Slims ability to bit stream both Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. As for the games we are finally starting to see the true potential of this amazing system. You get an amazing blu-ray player that is future proof thanks to the system being able to receive firmware updates via the web. If you have a 1080p HDTV you will be amazed at the picture quality which is up to six times more detailed than DVD. You also get theater quality sound and picture that DVD, cable, satellite HD, and even apple TV just can't touch because of their bandwidth limitations. If you have standard DVDs the PS3 upscales them to 1080p which brings all your DVDs to life. Don't expect blu-ray quality from watching DVDs, but do expect them to look much better and sharper because they are being upscaled to look better on your HDTV. I like the fact that the system has online connectivity and that it also has a built in browser should you just want to surf the internet. Most of all I like the fact that you get built in wi-fi. if you all ready have internet access you just have to set this up with your wi-fi router, or if your lucky enough you might be able to pick up free wi-fi if you don't have internet access. You can download your favorite music/videos to the ps3 hard drive and if available online it will display the artist names and songs. You can even connect a USB keyboard (along with almost any type of USB device) to make surfing the internet faster and more enjoyable. With the recently launched Playstation Store you can play demos, download classic PS1 and PS2 (and some new PS3 games) games, get wallpapers, and watch blu-ray and new movie trailers. With the new virtual world Home you can create a virtual character and explore the virtual world. If your friends have a PS3 you can meet them in home and Play virtual Pool, bowling, or invite them in to a PS3 game to play with you. You can rent movies (some in HD) from an always growing catalog and purchase many of them. The things that this new PS3 lacks from the original 60 gb model is SACD support, it only has 2 USB vs. the 4 on the original. The top left part of this PS3 doesn't open up like the old one because this one lacks the memory card slots. The good thing is that this PS3 is so much quieter and takes up less space than my original 60 gb because it uses a smaller chip which now makes it use less electricity. That was my biggest annoyance with the original PS3 was that it got a bit loud sometimes when watching movies or playing games which I felt a bit distracting. This new model is as quit as a mouse. The PS3 does everything. It plays CDs, DVDs, and, blu-ray discs. You get video chat, an internet browser, digital photo viewing, Playstation store movie rental (and video game) and purchases, and now Netflix streaming. The PS3 will likely be your home entertainment centerpiece. I have to say I am very happy with giving the Playstation 3 a chance and I highly recommend it for anyone who appreciates a great game system with some awesome entertainment features. With the new PS3 slim and a long overdue price cut SONY is back in the game, and with new games like Uncharted 2 and may other exclusives this is going to be the start of the new Playstation revolution. This system may be lacking some of the original PS3 60 gb features, but it is still one awesome entertainment powerhouse that I highly recommend!

An Excellent Choice For Those Who Waited To Get A PS3
Other than not being able to play PS2 games, the slim 250 GB is a great choice. For $350, you get a unit that is highly capable of playing awesome games, and BluRays + DVD movies.<br /><br />It's far more power efficient and weighs less than the "fat" design using a much more sleeker motherboard along with a smaller CELL Processor.<br /><br />The unit also doesn't have a "power brick" unlike some of it's competitors ahem*microsfot*ahem which is great. The power supply unit is built right into the PS3 yet the PS3 is still relatively light in weight.<br /><br />When in use, the slim PS3 is relatively quiet. You will notice that it will get a bit warm after a while, but that is normal since the unit is smaller, and the plastic casing of the unit is closer to all the circuitry.<br /><br />Unlike the "fat" model, Sony went with a matte finish on the top and bottom (no finger print magnet like the "fat" while giving it a glossy shiny on the sides. The disc tray area has a glossy finish as well. <br /><br />A big change from the "fat" model is that the Eject and Power buttons are now physically buttons as opposed to touch sensitive ones.<br /><br />With the PS3, you get access to the PlayStation Network where you can purchase digital copies of games from the PSone era along with PSN exclusive titles such as Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 and more!<br /><br />Hopefully, Sony will release a software download or include in a firmware update to enable PS2 games. <br /><br />Overall, I'm glad that I waited to get this PS3. There is a slightly cheaper 120 GB model but I'd definitely get the 250 GB model because you will eventually fill up the hard drive with a lot of stuff from game saves (PS3, PS1, and PS2), game installation files (for quicker load times; if a game offers the options), and content downloaded from the PlayStation Network.

Two Year Holdout Takes the Plunge
I've been kicking the tires and debating which high end game platform to purchase for the last two years or longer since both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 hit the market.   <br /><br />I jumped on the Nintendo Wii bandwagon the day it launched as I'm a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda series and this was a must have for me.  I have been playing most games on it such as the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series as well as the Mario titles however I get bored of most of the games pretty easily.   There have been many times over the last two years that I filled a cart with the 'starter' pieces of both systems, and deleted the cart instead of pushing the button.<br /><br />In the end, I chose the PS3 for the following reasons:<br /><br />1)  More of my friends that had both systems were buying games now for the PS3 when the titles were on both PS3/Xbox<br />2)  For the $349 price Point I get both online game play and wireless networking included in the game vs. an additional $150 at purchase and $50 a year afterwords<br />3)  Bluray Movie Playing.  <br /><br />Having got four titles with the purchase as part of my order I am very happy with my purchase.  I got 'kid friendly' games such as Little big Planet and Ratchet and Clank as well as some of the more mature titles of Call of Duty: MW2 and Borderlands.<br /><br />My only complaint is there is no mention that the HDMI requires some kind of copy protection crap to work.   If your TV is High Definition this doesn't guarantee it will work.  I've got a 2001 57" CRT Projection HDTV that does up to 1080i and has a DVI port.  I've been using my satellite DVR and other devices switched through an Outlaw 990 Pre-Amp for years with on issues.  The PS3 fired up and gave me a nice big black screen with no error messages or anything.  It took me an hour of troubleshooting and web surfing to figure out that my TV doesn't have this HDCP copy protection junk so it won't work with my PS3.   Being one to understand digital rights protection concerns at the same time this is stupid and it should at least give you a message out that port to the display what is going on.  no picture isn't enough.<br /><br />Other than this I had no issues getting the unit up & running on the PSN and playing some games locally and online using my wireless network.

Decision time. Xbox360 or PS3?
My bonus came in. Just enough to buy either an xbox elite or a playstation 3 slim. choices are very good as long as you do your research. I combed the web on both machines and the Red Ring of Death (RROD) and noise and heat complaints and comments can be found by multiple reviewers ON THE XBOX 360 in general. <br /><br />So, I decided to check this out myself with a visit to the local Gamestop store to see and hear both machines side by side. Sure enough, there was the XBOX in it's stand sounding like a jet engine even in it's plastic see through enclosure and then I looked over at the PS3 sitting on it's stand perfectly quiet but still running a beautiful demo, everything about it said "quality" from it's beautiful finish and straight tight and perfectly fitted buttons, edges and tastefully contrasting smooth shinny surfaces and matt black case, tiny sharp lights indicating she was running and all was well and will remain so. The PS3 is a work of art in technology and fit and finish and quality. The poor xbox 360 looked positively stone age compared to this latest generation. <br /><br />So, before deciding on playstation I remembered some words of advice, buy the maching based on it's games and not technology and I remembered how IBM and OS/2 were the better technical combination rather than Microsoft and their Windows product but anyone buying OS/2 soon found themselves without the best software. So checked out the games for each machine...Xbox had the most but PS3 had the best made for PS3 games and quality is better than quantity so I then had one more decision to make, 120 gig PS3 or 250 gig for only $49.95 more? <br /><br />Then I remembered another lesson I learned in the past, one can never had too much disk space and for fifty bucks more I more than double the space and double the future fun...it's a bargain, the 250 gig PS3 is the real bargain. <br /><br />Now please excuse me while I get back to saving the universe in the incredible gameplay and larger than life galaxy of "Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction " a made for PS3 game that clearly needs a  blu ray disc to hold this matching work of art. <br /><br />My apologies to Xbox owners.

Excellent
I didn't want the games only console...I wanted something which can play my hi def video files... which can play the downloaded movies in various formats directly on my TV...thru which I can see the online tv episodes... thru which I can see my photo albums....<br /><br />and PS3 meets all the criteria.. and it's one excellent machine...it gives you so many options...<br /><br />I can plug in my pen drive.. or USB hard disk... I haven't tried my digicam but I am sure it will recognize that as welll....<br /><br />the day I first used the PS3, then itself I said to myself it's fully worth the price... and I couldn't have got the better deal....<br /><br />it's been more than a month and I am still LOVING it....

PS3 as Bluray Player
We purchased the PS3 to use as Blu-ray Player.  It is excellent for this use and best of all with the WiFi connection we were able to link it to our Netflix account and have been streaming movies.  A+++ for this use.

Netflix rock ...in this thing!
I received the console today and activated my netflix account today...well I received the netflix disk first. I am very impressed with the clarity of the movies. I have a 46" sharp aquos, full HD @1080P with with 120Hz Fine Motion Enhanced.<br /><br />The feel and look of this console is solid. It commands a lot of respect in my entertainment center. Setup was a breeze. System updates was quick.<br /><br />What else to say...this thing rocks! Get one if you can.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0H738">PlayStation 3 250 GB</a>

Obviously...it's a next-gen console.
I believe that people who own a 360, and people who just own this (a PS3) should just get along and see the real threat...the Nintendo Wii lol. Anyways, I've had this system for a good week now, and I am just in awe how rich colors are, and how much fun Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is on the PS3. Sony has yet again out-done themselves. Does this mean that the PS3 is superior than the XBOX 360? No, it just means that it is more versatile than the XBOX 360. Look at it this way, if you're an advent gamer, who prides his or herself in buying a next-gen console that will fulfill their craving for explosions, high-intense moments, and out-of-this-world graphics, then I suggest both systems, because you'll never be satisfied owning just one and not the other...kinda like Married w/ Children (cheap pop!).<br /><br />The PS3 is a must buy this holiday season simply because changes are coming in the form of exclusive titles being port over from *coughs* XBOX 360 (don't listen to the fan boys about it not happening, it's a billion-dollar business, and profits must be had...case and point Metal Gear Solid Rising), update to the chat & party system (you'll experience XBOX Live like chatting and party-gaming), and even more unknown, yet high anticipated titles being released (i.e. Hard Rain and Mag). I've own every Playstation that Sony has ever made (some even from Japan), and I've been happy with every one of them. What people fail to see is that Sony has set trends that others either improve, meet, and may beat, yet Sony has never made a bad system no one wants to buy. This is a Blu-Ray player, video-game system, web-browser, and media player all-in-one. Your son will never leave his room, your daughter will love Zach Efron and the Twlight Sagas in full 1080P, your husband will secretly be playing Uncharted while you're sleeping, and your wife won't admit that she loves Killzone 2 while having unlocked a 100% on it. This is an awesome machine that does it all! I have both a 360 and a PS3 now, and I must say that there's a slight difference, but nothing huge that makes one system better than the other. This system is perfect for those with an XBOX 360, or just getting a new system. I highly recommend picking this, Uncharted 2, Killzone 2, and Infamous this Christmas...best decision I've ever made. I recommend the 250GB PS3 Slim only to those who download a lot of extra content, but not enough to shoot past 100GBs. Another reason why I like the PS3...you can swap-out your hard drive to upgrade to a 500GB hard drive! Just make sure is a SATA notebook hard drive with 5400RPMs, b/c anything else will not work with Sony's PS3 OS.<br /><br />BTW! Make sure you pick-up an XtremeMac HDMI cable (or any HDMI 1.3 Category 2 cable will do...I just like XtremeMac's accessories...BTW do not be too cheap w/ HDMI cables, make sure it's a Category 2...trust me), or Sony's Component Cable as Sony was too cheap to give you a Hi-Def cable. To me this was the only negative, but this, taking-out the backwards capability (playing PS1 and PS2 games on the PS3), removing extra USB ports, and taking-out the memory slots helped keep the cost affordable so they could help out us very "thrifty" gamers lol.

Sony does it again
Another good system to add to my sony collection. The playstation is a wonderful system that at first i didnt like but got hooked on since the first Playstation. Naughty Dog and Insomniac, creators of the crash bandicoot, jak and daxter, spyro the dragon and ratchet and clank series, still follow Sony with games that are a must have. The trophy idea is a fun system to try to just collect as many trophies as one can to level up. Fast downloadable which doesn't interfere with gameplay since you can download it on the background. Interestingly enough, the ps3 has printer features which you can connect your printer to the ps3, not sure how, haven't tried it. <br /><br />The slogan "It only does everything" is sort of true since it can't play ps2 games but the online accesibility is fast and reliable. <br />The downloadable content is well done, however more games should be added like the call of duty series from the ps2. <br /><br />The fan and noise issues aren't that bad as people suggest. The heat isnt as strong as the xbox360 pro, but havent checked the elite to compare it with. <br /><br />Online gameplay seems cool however some disconnection issues may occur. For online chatting with your friends I would reccomend the accesories though they arent needed but help with communication. Bluetooth connection allows you to use your bluetooth headsets so no need to buy the playstation headset. <br />Overall it is a great console with many features. Like all systems it has its features and the lacks. But if youre into gaming mainly single player or co-op or maybe even online without paying 50 dollars yearly, it is a good console to buy. <br /><br />The extended warranty sony gives to the console is unbeatable by any non-online retailer. 100 dollars for 4 years. However I'd recommend squaretrade.

Great Addition!
Bought the ps3 and haven't looked back. With its additional blu-ray playing ability and wi-fi capability, the ps3 (at the moment) is most definitely the ultimate entertainment system.

Well worth it
I was debating whether or not to buy a new system for the longest time, and then I finally saw this and said I need to get one. Very fast respond time and enough memory for a long time make this machine a must for anyone looking to upgrade your system. I got this machine, another controller, charging dock for the controllers, and seven games (08-09) for under the orignal price of the PS3 (600 dollars). I recommend it.

Great price for a powerful machine!
I have never owned a Playstation in my life.  I had played off of the original playstation like ten years ago.  I have always been an Xbox/PC fan, but decided that I needed a playstation 3 so that I could play Heavy Rain when it comes out.  Good thing I waited, because this awesome slim version came out with all this memory.  The machine is delightful!  The internet is free (unlike Xbox Live) and it looks great in HD on my big screen TV.  It also plays blue-ray flawlessly.  If you are going to get a Playstation 3, go with this model!!

Double the Pleasure Double the Fun
I bought the PlayStation for the Blu-Ray player.  It is one of the best players on the market.  You can buy a player cheaper but you don't get the added feature of being able to play games.  I was not a game player when I bought the machine but I received a game for Christmas and I must admit it is a nice additional feature.  Some of the new games are quite sophisticated and fun to play.  So with this device you can play old DVD's, Blu-Ray DVD's and get games as well. Not a bad deal for the price.

GREAT SYSTEM BUT wha happen to the HDD
Well the ps3 is awesome. SO far so good.IT runs quite and it gets warm after a few hours of play time. The sync capability is so awesome if your tv has that feature. The only negative thing about it is that when you check the system settings and look at system information the Free space was at 232. I checked it before i downloaded some stuff at i think it said 219/232. But now I am at 197 and i haven't even downloaded that many stuff yet. I have no idea where some of those gigs are going. If you can, check it out how many gigs you have before you download anything.

A True Multi Media Console
This is simply the best console available right now. 1080p Resolution, runs all my blu ray movies at fast speeds with no lag. Has tons of hard drive space for my movies and photos as well as downloaded content from the playstation store. Free online along with some of the best gaming titles of the year. 2010 is going to be the year for PS3 with games like MAG, Gran Turismo 5, and God of War III going exclusive, there's no reason not to own one!

PS3 250GB
Bought as a gift for a close pal who hesitated getting a Blu-Ray for his HD home theater.  Sorry I didn't get one for myself, especially now that Blu-Ray movies are down to $13.  The firmware update feature makes this one of the best ways to go.  Serious video guys want menus to tweak the picture, serious movie fans want to sit and enjoy the film.  The second group should be using one of these, plus it plays games!

[Anyone remembers the old "I am not going to spend a lot for this muffler" commercial?]<br /><br />I'd like to begin by making it clear that any HDMI 1.3 cable will work with a PS3 and that this specific HDMI cable will work with any device that needs one, be it a PS3 or not.<br /><br />The 3-6 ft. are the optimum lengths to connect most electronics. I am actually using 3 ft. cables whenever the connected devices happen to be very close to each other.<br /><br />Just in case someone may feel guilty for not paying a lot more for a premium brand, it should be stated that at this lengths - 3-6 ft., you will get as good a service from a no-brand cable as you would from a super-expensive rip-off. An HDMI 1.3x cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out.<br /><br />The FUD campaigns, trying to attract buyers toward the more expensive brands make a series of claims. I will address them, as they may apply to this specific cable.<br /><br />- Signal attenuation is less over a more expensive cable. - TRUE, BUT that's irrelevant on a 3-6 ft. length. The HDMI consortium stated that even the cables that were not 'certified' as 'Category 2' or 'High-Speed' will meet the requirements at lengths of 6 ft. or less.  At 3-6 ft., it would be a waste to consider an 'expensive' alternative. In addition, the newer devices have sufficient processing power and are sensitive enough to properly interpret even the more ambiguous 'digits' they receive.<br /><br />- The expensive cables are better engineered and their contacts are less likely to break. - TRUE, BUT how many times is one going to plug/unplug an HDMI cable in and out of an HDMI socket over the cable's lifetime? 5 times? 10 times? The 'better engineered' claim has no practical importance. If your cable works on 'day one' the odds are that it will be left in the back of your box for many months or years before it is unplugged and plugged back in. If this cable is purchased for home use, the 'better engineered' claim should not be of a major concern.<br /><br />- The more expensive cables are 'future proof'. - NOT TRUE. Claims are made that, if you buy the more expensive wires you won't have to buy new ones when 'new standards' emerge because the more expensive wire will support them. This is untrue on 2 different levels. First, your cheap cable was purchased to work with some very specific devices which need HDMI 1.3 and will never support the 'new standard'. The new standards will be supported by new electronic devices but, for as long as you keep the existing ones, you will still need this cable to connect them. Second, the emerging HDMI 1.4 specs call for new features such as an Ethernet channel and an audio return channel, both of which can't be supported by the existing HDMI 1.3 cables so, no matter how large a bandwidth the existing expensive cables may support, it won't matter because you still won't able to use them if you are to take full advantage of an HDMI 1.4 device so... there goes your $5 invesment or... your $200, depending on your having purchased a 'cheap' or a 'top of the line' HDMI cable.<br /><br />________________________________________<br /><br />Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by both this cable and its more expensive alternatives.<br /><br />Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz)	340<br />Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s)	10.2<br />Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16<br />Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86<br />Maximum Color Depth (bit/px)	48<br /><br />Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px		25601600p75<br />Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px		25601600p60<br />Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px		1920x1200p75<br />Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px		19201200p60<br /><br />sRGB					<br />YCbCr					<br />8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capability					<br />Blu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolution					<br />Consumer Electronic Control (CEC)					<br />DVD-Audio support					<br />Super Audio CD (DSD) support					<br />Deep Color					<br />xvYCC					<br />Auto lip-sync					<br />Dolby TrueHD bitstream capable					<br />DTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capable					<br />Updated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)<br />________________________________________<br /><br />My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more. I took home one of the 'expensive' ones once because the salesman promised to take it back if I wasn't amazed by the difference. It made zero difference and I returned it.

Good Buys
This is going to be short but sweet. These generic HDMI cables are exponentially cheaper and work just as well as the $100+ Playstation name brand. Save your money!

Works very well.
First of this is my first review on amazon though I have purchased an abundant amount of items from this website.  I felt compelled to write this review because this HDMI cable does work excellently.  I bought a 55 inch HDTV for Black Friday and couldn't wait to try it out with my Playstation 3.  As a result I bought a Phillips 30 dollar 3ft long HDMI cable even though I had this one on the way. I was amazed by the clear and crisp quality the Phillips HDMI cable provided and worried that an 18 cent cable won't be able to match up.  However it did and thankfully the Phillips HDMI cable can be returned. You won't go wrong if you decide to purchase this cable.

WORKS EXACTLY LIKE THE EXPENSIVE ONES!
I SPENT OVER $70 FOR MY FIRST HDMI CABLE AT BESTBUY LAST YEAR FOR MY PS3, SOMEONE STEPPED ON IT AND BROKE ONE OF THE ENDS, I WAS IN NO POSITION TO BUY ANOTHER $70 CABLE.  I FIGURED WHY NOT TAKE A CHANCE SINCE THE PRICE WAS EXTREMELY CHEAP.  AND IT WORKS EXACTLY!!!! LIKE THE $70 CABLE.  IF YOU NEED A HDMI CABLE AND WONDER IF THE PRICE IS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE...ITS TRUE!  I BOUGHT IT FOR MY PS3 AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY!

No need to spend $99, I get a full 1080p with a $6 cable.<br />

Great HDMI cable for a cheap price!
I seen the review that Michael Lende posted about this product and I put them to the test because at first I was iffy on wanting to use a cable that could short out or harm my tv or PS3. In my opinion his review wasn't fair, he received a bad cable and the company should've responded to his email's about the product.<br /><br />When buying an item like this, no matter where you buy it, you always risk the chance of buying something that can malfunction. It just happens. If you plan on using this cable for gaming purposes, especially for your PS3, it does not black your screen and cut while messaging someone on the Playstation Network and this cable works fine with the PS3's online capabilities. I previously used a $40 Philips HDMI cable, my only problem with it was that it was too short and I didn't want to pay another $15+ to replace it with a longer one. To compare these two cables is simple, they produce the same picture quality and is durable. Only difference is the length. To find an HDMI cable at this price that works just as good as your high end manufacturers is honestly hard to find. This is an awesome buy if you can't afford to buy the more pricey HDMI cables.<br />

Great Cable
This cable is a must-buy! It works great everywhere! I've been using it for almost anything, for my PS3, my new 1080p TV, my laptop... I don't think a store cable will be any better than this one because they definitely cannot beat this price!

Not a game (weird review questions) - great cable, though.
HDMI cables can cost up through (and probably beyond) $80 for 6ft. CRAZY! This little cable performs great (connects between my PS3 and my 1080p TV) for much less. Shipment was a little slow but it got here.

Great Cable for Great Price
I bought this cable to hook up WD HD TV to a 54" HDTV and it worked great.  The price was only little over 3 bucks for this HDMI cable.  The picture quality was at 1080p and it was perfect.  I'm very satisfied with the cable.  One thine I'm not sure of is whether this cable is AWG 24 or 28.  But hey, it's working.

WILL YOU JOIN THE SPARTAN ARMY?
If you don't then you will be missing out on, easily, one of GREATEST games of all time! I thought I was blown away by Uncharted 2. I was but I am even more so with God Of War 3. Unbelievably, God Of War 3 floored me from the 30 minute opening sequence to the mind blowing finale. How did Sony Santa Monica pull this off? The SCALE of this game will boggle the mind and make your jaw hit the floor! When I first played the demo some 3 months ago I was in awe. After having played through every luscious drop of GOW 3 I am spellbound beyond belief. If I could only use one word to describe this game: EPIC! Remember the old home arcade system Neo Geo and SNK's motto for it "Bigger, Badder, Better"? This applies to GOW 3 in spades.<br /><br />Upon first sight of GOW 3 you'll notice that the high def graphics are probably the best, on any system anywhere, computer gaming rigs included. Sony really tapped into the "true" power of the PS3 with this one. Some of the things I saw in this game is making me think it was all a dream because it just isn't possible in games, right? Wrong. Seeing the gigantic titans filling up the whole screen in perfect graphical splendor, on a 50 in. plasma, all the while Kratos is scaling it, and fighting a boss(Poseidon) on it, is completely amazing. Gamers, this is what we live for! The detail of not just the titans, the environments, and the Ghost of Sparta himself, but the minor enemies, such as the skeleton warriors, is astonishing. And seeing 15 or so of these skeleton warriors pile on Kratos and then seeing him violently power them off is unbelievably cool and empowering. It almost makes you feel like a god! The sheer power you feel controlling Kratos and watching him annihilate everything in his path in the name of vengeance will cast a spell over you.<br /><br />The combat control is much the same as before, if not better. In other words, the control is flawless and if ain't broke don't fix it philosphy applies here. There are timed button presses for the boss battles(quick timed events). And bosses there will be. Some of them are absolutely enormous, such as Hades. Dealing death to the bosses is quite a sight. Impale them. Check! Rip off body parts. Check! Let blood and guts flow like a river. Check! This is one of the goriest and most violently graphic games I've seen. EVER! Kratos can still have sex in GOW 3! Always a welcome addition. Even one scene with a goddess! I think what might impress me most besides the scale of the game, is the number of enemies that can be on screen at one time. At times, there had to be close to 50 or more on screen. That is incredible considering it's running at 60 FPS the entire time with no slowdown. All of that even when there are cyclopses and minotaurs on the same screen, along with a titan in the background. Ridiculously amazing!<br /><br />The story, sadly, was the most disappointing part of the game. It seemed a bit convoluted; like too much was going on with too many different characters. The story is not bad mind you and it`s easy to follow, it just feels like it's taking a major backseat to everything else. Still, it takes nothing away from the greatness of GOW 3. The puzzles in the game are challenging without being overly so and some of them very clever and ingenious. More than a few I was a bit stumped by. All in all it took me about 10 to 12 hours to roll through this masterpiece. I don't really remember how long it took me to go through each of the first two, so I can't compare length. While a bit short, for my taste, it was still one hell of a magnificent ride! The camera still can't be controlled by the player, but that has never bothered me and I think it was put to even better use this time around. It seems the angles and various shots are Hollywoodesque, if that makes any sense. <br /><br />Weapons! The Cestus easily steals the show of the several new ones that you'll earn. The Cestus is completely WICKED! The combo moves are spectacular and more so than ever before and you can now swap weapons on the D-pad in the middle of one. When surrounded by a bunch of baddies and knowing you have different button options to pound the pulp out of them is especially gratifying. The use of the bow and arrow is easy and very useful. Very cool shooting the harpies with it and grabbing on to them to further your progress across chasms or to the top of places well out of your reach. I like the fact that now the bow quickly recharges after each use. I love being able to pick up enemies and charge with them, using them as a battering ram on other baddies. Completely awesome! Controlling the cyclops is amazing as well; swinging him around and pulping your enemies is gleefully sadistic. It must be experienced! You level up your health and magic much the same way as the two previous GOW's via feathers, stones, and now, minotaur horns.<br /><br />The music is excellent! But hasn't the music always been excellent in the series? The voice acting IMHO is top notch. Seems even better than before. The action and pace of the game are relentless. Something new(and amazing) and unique is always happening to keep you glued to the screen; even if it happens only once. There is so much more I could go on talking about with this stunning, amazing, and breathtaking game known as God Of War 3, but I`d be here for a while and then you`d be bored;) <br /><br />I don't care what genre of games you like or whether or not you even like GOW 3 type games, this is a game that absolutely MUST be experienced. I won't say this is my favorite game of all time, but it's right there at the top with Uncharted 2, Modern Warfare 2, Metal Gear 4, and Resident Evil 4. I don't care if you have to get an extra job(gulp), rob a convenient store(gasp) or steal if off your friend(yeah!) you have got to get this SOON! I've been playing games for 30+ years(since the days of Colecovision) and I've never been this AMAZED by a game! There is so much diversity, so much to see, so much so tightly packed in such a spectacular game that it will make you wonder how they pulled it oof. Folks, the next generation of gaming has arrived and I am stunned, blown away, mesmerized and spellbound by what Sony Santa Monica created. My hat goes off to them for they are a TRULY talented team! Kudos of accolades go to Stig Asmussen for his brilliant direction of this game and for making it so much more than I thought possible.<br /><br />This seems to be the end of this GOW saga and I hope we'll see more of Kratos in the future, because this is only a scratch on the video game surface of the great things the future could hold for the Ghost of Sparta. I am truly moved! <br /><br />It's a 10/10 experience!<br /><br />ARE YOU GOING TO JOIN THE SPARTAN ARMY NOW?<br /><br /><br /><br />SIDE NOTE(or bottom note) - I'm not sure why this game was released earlier than it's scheduled March 16th release date. I had originally preordered GOW 3 on Amazon, but after I found I could get it nearly a week earlier on eBay I cancelled my Amazon pre-order. Not that I'm complaining about any of that. The same thing happened with Modern Warfare 2. I'd like to know how people are getting these games so early. The guy I bought my copy from on eBay said he'd had his copies since March 6th,. He wouldn't elaborate as to where he got them. I received mine on March 11th. I had to pay and arm and a leg for it, but it was worth every dime.

Oh my God .....
I have seen my share of games throughout my life. I'm almost 30 years old and video games have been one of my life's greatest hobbies. I have enjoyed playing video games more than anything else. But never did I dreamed more than 15 yrs ago when playing in an Game Gear from Sega that I would experience such a thing.<br /><br />God of War 3 is simply breathtaking. It is as epic as any movie. It has no equal in the video game world.<br /><br />The graphics, the music, the superb gameplay everything combines into a massive juggernaut that will rock you to the core. GOW3 deserves its place among the all time greats like Tetris, Super Mario, etc. <br /><br />In the hack-n-slash genre, it reigns supreme. In the all-time great, it can be debated if it takes the top spot, but no one will leave this game feeling the same.<br /><br />We live in a truly amazing World where a treasure such as this can be purchased for such a paltry sum.

Easily a GOTY contender
God of War 3 opens with a massive bang; starting right off from God of War 2, we find Kratos scaling Mount Olympus going after Zeus with the 4 Titans climbing up the mountain ready to cause havoc. From there it's basically a whirlwind of a nearly 40 minute setpiece involving characters on a massive scale, an epic boss fight and some light platforming to break up the action. In a way, this sequence sets up for what you're going to be playing for this roughly 10 hour game (the save point before the long final boss/ending sequence has me at 9 hours 31 minutes) which is graphically gorgeous, refined gameplay from previously and an impressive sense of scale. From there, game doesn't quite match the heights but it's still an incredibly solid adventure but in a way that's kind of the problem with a massive opening sequence; the rest of the game just doesn't have it again but does perform really adequately with what it does show. So 3 years in the making, new director, new system...how does the 3rd installment hold up? Pretty damn well, have to say.<br /><br />Story: As I said before, the game starts you off with Kratos going after Zeus but naturally like God of War 2 or Metroid games, certain things happen that force you to essentially restart from scratch and we go into a tale of Kratos wanting to enact vengeance and near literally kills everyone who stands in his way. From there we will meet familiar gods, battle massive titans and go in and around Mount Olympus as we make our way back to Zeus. Best thing about the story is the pacing which like Uncharted 2, seems to do a really great job at making you feel like you're actually progressing in the game instead of hitting these weird slow areas (remember finding those stupid Sirens in the sandstorm in the first one?) but the opening sequence with Poseidon opens with a bang and it settles into a nice groove and while there isn't anything as jaw-dropping of a scene afterwards, game never lets up and you might find yourself playing longer than you thought you were.<br /><br />Graphics: I'll get one negative out of the way as far as graphically: this game didn't constantly stun me like Uncharted 2 which front to back looks phenomenal. In this game, you'll find parts that'll want to make you go "holy ****" but then other parts look pretty with nice detail until something pops up that makes you say wow again. There, can I talk about how awesome this game looks? And you'll see it right there in the main menu screen which now has the almost iconic Kratos staring at you only this time the detail on his model is really impressive. And there's my favorite thing which is the lighting, especially in low-light situations and having your weapons briefly illuminate the room looks amazing. One cutscene did stutter and lip sync on one line was off though it might've been because a trophy was unlocked at that point but it's easy to see why this game was highly anticipated on the graphics front.<br /><br />Sound/Music: Naturally the word "epic" will be tossed around here and for good measure in that while I won't exactly be humming these tunes anytime, the grandiose music perfectly sets the tone with its big choir parts, percussion and intense orchestra. Old familiar sounds are back, weapons and that loud bang you get when doing a big strong attack's still there though the Helios head still makes that bizarre scream everytime you take it out which can potentially get grating. With regards to voice acting, some familiar faces pop up making you go "wait...did they hire...?" so we have Rip Torn providing voice for Hephaestus, Hercules' Kevin Sorbo as who else but Hercules and Malcolm McDowell as Daedalus, father to Icarus. Would've been nice to see who did other voices as well such as Zeus, Hera, Gaia or something since only a select few are chosen in the special features.<br /><br />Gameplay: One thing I never liked about previous God of War games is that there's always these weird parts in the game that get put in to not necessarily ruin it but kind of make you wish other things were put in instead. None of the puzzles are that taxing to the brain which is good since I always felt God of War puzzles were too vague in their how-to-solve solutions. Combat feels more tactician based here where it doesn't require a real sense of precision but just mashing square and the occasional triangle will only get you so far and in fact certain enemies are way more vulnerable to certain weapons than others. That being said I still find the controls to not be as super responsive as I saw in Bayonetta. If I wanted her to jump, she jumped; dodge, she dodged but here you'll be tapping that right analog stick to get out of the way and for some reason, Kratos just doesn't move while other times he dodges out of the way. But the powerups and skills are actually useful and the battles, except for one duel involving a new unbelievably annoying enemy type and a dog that spits out other dogs grated on my nerves. The game also has some backtracking which is odd because I remember in previous God of Wars I did that very little and if I did it's because I went somewhere to give me something that'll turn on something but in this game you'll literally re-see areas more than once because that's what the story needs. Minor gripe but in God of War 1, I always felt like I was moving forward and seeing what else the game had in store for me; here it feels like a slight hub world.<br /><br />One improvement over previous games is how the QTE events work. Whereas before a big Triangle or Circle would show up in the center of the screen, the prompts now show up on their respective corners in relation to where they are on the controller (Circle is Right, Triangle's up etc) so thanks to your eye's weird peripheral vision, you can actually tell which side of the screen a prompt showed up in which keeps your eyes focused on the fantastically gory kills Kratos can do. Also the "mash Circle" prompts feel a lot more forgiving now and as an example, take the Minotaur. Remember how in God of War 1, you climbed on his chest and tried to run a blade down his mouth? Well I remember my hand hurting because regardless of how fast I was pressing, it still felt like Kratos took way too long to jab that knife in there but now it feels quicker and doesn't require insane amounts of speed to get done. My one issue is in regards to the R1 prompts in the levels themselves in that they either took me a bit of time to actually access them (I'll end up running around a save point until the prompt came up sometimes) or in one case, I had to open a door to rescue someone from being smooshed yet for some reason the game didn't actually let me grab that thing despite my pressing R1. Some might not notice it but that's what I saw anyway.<br /><br />Upon completing the game, you'll be rewarded with the super hard Titan mode, Challenge of the Gods where you got to perform certain tasks in an arena like killing everyone with no weapons used or making sure enemies don't respawn past a certain limit. They're kind of fun but there's only 7 or so and they can be potentially frustrating. There's also a combat arena which I assume is meant as a kind of testing area to hone your fighting skills though it would've been cool if it acted as a quasi-Horde mode where you had to see how long you can survive. Also unlocked are the traditional God of War making-of videos which I think seriously needs to become a staple in games since we never really get to see the talent or even hardships a team can face so for example in these videos, we see the sudden departure of Cory Balrog, director of God of War 2 and the "promotion" of new director Stig Asmussen, their jitters about unveiling an E3 demo which still needs to be reworked 2 weeks before the event and all in all, they're great looks into a game company known for talent but we don't quite see enough of it in other developers and if we do, it's usually those talking head interviews about all the cool stuff we're doing. Plus they're usually in Collector's Editions.<br /><br />Is God of War 3 the absolute best game of 2010? It's certainly one of the top ones but considering the almost wallet-busting array of games coming out this year, there's no doubt many will remember this game but whether it wins, it can be likely but keep in mind Mass Effect 2 came out this year, Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid and possibly Zelda are out, Halo Reach might even be more than just a shinier Halo 3 and if the Last Guardian comes out this year than that's my automatic GOTY but whereas God of War 3 is pretty short, it's a pretty balls-to-the-wall experience that everyone needs to play at least once.

"The End Begins..."
Thanks for reading my first review here on Amazon. I normally don't review stuff like this online but I can't get this game out of my head. I've had my jaw hit the floor more times in the first couple hours than I've ever had in an entire game before. When people describe this game as epic, they are not just using some cliche word everyone on the internet throws around. The cover of God of War 3 should be in the dictionary next to the word.<br /><br />First, I highly suggest anyone new to the series to go ahead and pick up the God of War Collection. It is some of the best the PS2 has to offer for only $30. It will bring you up to date on the story and help you get aquainted with the combat system so you can jump right into part 3 no problem. This brings me to my next point, difficulty. I'm hearing the term "button-masher" thrown around quite a lot in regards to this game and while this might be true for the easy and normal difficulties, it couldn't be further from the truth on Titan (hard) mode. Having beaten the two previous games recently, I started GoW3 on Titan difficutly. There is no way you can spam the same combos and expect to make it anywhere. For those familiar with the previous instances of God of War, or for you hack-n-slash pros out there, I highly suggest starting off on Titan mode. This will provide a much greater challenge and get you ready to play on Chaos mode after you've unlocked it.<br /><br />For the most part, the gameplay remains unchanged from the previous titles. If it ain't broke don't fix it right? However, there are a few differences that greatly enhance the experiece. For starters, the QTEs now put the button prompts in relation to their location on the controller (triangle appears at the top of the screen, X on the bottom ect.). This allows the player to view whatever violent act Kratos is performing at the time without having the button prompt cover it all. Another great change is the ability to switch weapons on the fly, mid combo. This allows for a lot of creativiy to be used in how you dispatch each enemy. Lastly, one of my favorite additions to the combat system is the combat grapple. Kratos will fling both blades into an enemy and pull himself towards them. This greatly increases combo variety and makes it easier to string together lots and lots of hits.<br /><br />When it comes to presentation in video games, God of War 3 takes the cake. You can tell a lot of work was put into making the game look amazing. I must have spent the first 10 minutes just staring at how detailed Kratos looks. The boss battles and level design redefine what scale is in games today. Some people might be put off by the fixed camera, but this allows the directors of the game to give you breathtaking views and truly show off all the hard work they put into making this one of the most visually pleasing experiences you will ever have. All the trailers and screens you could watch won't hold a candle to how this game looks live on a nice 1080p TV set. <br /><br />In closing, God of War 3 is one of most amazing experiences you can find in gaming today. Other games might have a little more depth to their combat systems, but none of them put together the entire package of gameplay, graphics, sound, story, and overall fun. If you've been on the edge about picking up a PS3, let Kratos make that decision for you. Do yourself a favor and BUY this game!!!

G o W 3 is a System seller
<br />I got a PS3 for this game, great investment;  reality i am just starting the game, but man in the first chapter is bar none the best graphics i have ever seen in a video game, yes even Uncharted 2 and Mass Effect2 ; and the gameplay is godly smooth, well i will update the review later on , but until now is incredible and awesome,  i never thought i will see this types of greatness in my time. Buy it guys , if you dont own a PS3 is about time you get it , you are missing one unique experience.

5 stars, can I give more, epic end to one of the best titles ever!
Picked up GOW1 before out of pure curiosity - from then on, got hooked to the whole saga!  And after nearly 3 years of waiting and and a well-worth-it-$6/hr gameplay, this is one of the best PS3 games ever, up there with MGS4, MW1&2.  Stunning graphics (even GOW1&2's graphics harnessed the PS2's full potential and even exceeded most PS3 games!) on this one, makes you feel so small in the enormous run of things.<br /><br />7.1 audio - makes me want to cry.  I am quite surprised why this did not receive a THX rating, unlike Resistance FOM1.<br /><br />In GOW1, I never would have imagined killing a god in Ares, but in this one, never imagined killing BOTH god and titan, and the makers for this one were smart enough to give you 1st person views of this.  Even sex with a goddess...hah!<br /><br />GOW as a rule usually has very physical button-mashing demands, but this one toned it down a bit to allow the player more focus on the images.  Even the placing of timed buttons during mini-games was very smart - allowed me to focus on the beautiful images during these fights.<br /><br />The brilliance of the makers of this series is also with the storyline - very well done, you start with a titan, an area in the underworld - go through an epic journey - all to end up in the original place.  Very smart, and make you feel accomplishing so much in the grand run of things.<br /><br />Kudos SCE Sta Monica - well done game.<br /><br />PS - btw, there are so many Kratos wannabes out there, unfortunately I did purchase Dante's Inferno and demoed Dark World or something like that - YOU ALL ARE NOT WORTHY.  Just the pure brilliance that the control system, graphics, story line, puzzle difficulty, interpretation of Greek mythology - JUST UNPARALLELED AND OUTSTANDING.

Don't get scared away by the "hack and slash" label
This game is far more than a "hack and slash" game. I was wary of buying it because - not having played the previous games - I figured it would be hours of killing squishy masses while you steamroll all the way to the end credits. I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of the actual game.<br /><br />Sure, you blow up legions of minor creatures, but that's a sort of mini-game between the actual content. The bosses are tough. The gameplay is a blend of cinematic and action easily on par with Uncharted 2. The gameplay itself is incredibly varied, outright epic in the sheer number of situations tossed at you.<br /><br />And far from pushing random buttons.. you need to use proper ability combos, though how you decide to tackle a particular situation is up to you. Just as an example, there's a fight somewhat early on where you're up against a Gorgon (Medusa was a Gorgon, to give you an idea of what they look like) while harpies drop bomb-like things on you from the air. You have to jump/dodge to avoid what the harpies are dropping on you, while keeping the Gorgon occupied, as else she'll cast a spell that turns everyone in front of her to stone (and if you don't break out of that fast enough, anything can kill you in one hit). If you kill the harpies first (which requires latching on to them in turn, jumping up and tossing them onto the ground, etc.), a Minotaur spawns. If you kill her, another Minotaur and another set of harpies spawn. It's up to you to decide what order to take all of them out in. But here's an example of how the combat is up to you.. you can keep the Gorgon alive and go stand by the newly spawned Minotaur, wait for her to cast the stone spell, and jump/dive out of the way to turn the *Minotaur* to stone, taking him out in just a few hits (if you kill him the normal way, you get health, so it's up to you - kill him fast by risking getting hit with a powerful spell, or slowly and get some health out of it). The depth of combat is amazing!<br /><br />There are also standard adventure game style puzzles, much like Uncharted 2 (complete with moving objects around, blowing things up, jumping/climbing/swinging around like a monkey, and some that are very difficult to figure out - I'd recommend spending the 15 mins wondering "what the hell am I supposed to do here?! is this a bug?" instead of looking them up online, it's worth it).<br /><br />There are RPG elements as well. You can upgrade your weapons in any order you want, collect items from somewhat hidden areas (explore, explore, explore!) which will increase your health/item ability (which boosts how long you can shoot your bow before waiting for it to recharge, for example)/mana (spells! you cast spells!), and gather new weapons and abilities as you go.<br /><br />The graphics are also on par with (or very close to) Uncharted 2. The music, storyline, etc. help create an amazing atmosphere. The environments, like the rest of the game, will dazzle you with their depth and variety. I would suggest spending 5 minutes watching the storyline so far (dozens of videos on YouTube) to really get into it.<br /><br />It's an amazing game. Having mastered the notoriously-difficult Demons Souls, I'd have to say that playing this on Hard is much more difficult than Demons Souls ever was. Dismissing this as a hack and slash game is a huge mistake. This is a must-buy game for the PS3.

HD at its best trust me!!!<br />3 - Amazing in general, this should win every honor because I am still blown away.

Xbox what?
Hey, this for all the haters out there especially the reviewer who gave the game 1 star. Oh my God! If you haven't played God of War 1 and 2 then I strongly suggest you do so before playing the game. Coming in fresh on this one will leave you wondering what's going on and who's who. As for all my God of War fans out there this is the answer to our prayers! GOW 3 surpasses my wildest expectations and I've only played it for 30 minutes (had to study for exam). Everything from the graphics to the beautiful graphics are top noch! I manage to fight Psoideon(sorry if I spelled his name wrong) and let me tell you...Kratos has never finished off an enemy more brutally! Keepin it short....God of War 3 is now my favorite game! Haters need to admit it...Sony got this on lock! Peace!

Finished GOW3 yesterday - best of the 3!
I finished God of War 3 last night (Wed) after purchasing it Tuesday morning. I'm not going to go into lengthy detail other than to say that the game is spectacular! I had the misfortune (or fortune, depending on how you look at it) of being sick, so was able to play most of two days without having to work. It's on par with the other two games as far as length - took about 10 to 12 hours to beat, but I also try not to rush through a game just to finish it, so take that into consideration.<br /><br />A lot of the old elements that made the first two games great are still in this one - story, graphics, voice-acting, music, game-play - and in many cases, are improved upon. Some minor alterations in game-play are fantastic, making the game much more enjoyable (when you have to push a particular button, instead of just showing you that button, it also appears on the screen in its relative position. For instance, the game will prompt you to push a 'triangle' it not only appears on the screen, it appears at the top of the screen, making it easier to determine what you need to push in the heat of battle and at the same time allowing you to actually watch the battle on the screen instead of focusing on the next button).<br /><br />Anyway, the point is - the game is fantastic. Lots of fun. Very well done in all areas. Best of the three GOW titles. Best game I've played in a while. I was actually sad when it was over. Left me wanting more, for sure.

GOW3 is GOTY10
God of War 3 will be Game of the Year for 2010! Don't believe any reviews lower than 4. Basically anything given here in Amazon 3 stars and down for GOW3 is straight up nitpicking at anything to sour an awesome game experience. I know its your own opinions, but when I hear someone low star review because... oh so much blood?? oh the camera is fixed?? oh is a button smasher?? If you didnt know this before picking up the game, then is your own fault. GOW has blood, and a lot of it, ripping apart your oponent and smashing them against walls are the way you get ahead. Hence the M for mature rating.. The camera is fixed in the most theatrical way possible, for me surpases the previous games. It is more than just a button smasher hack and slash game, you have puzzles to solve, places or bosses to climb... You also level up your weapons at a right pace. Huge..... I mean HUGE!!!!! Boss fights!! Id say all of the boss fights are EPIC! The graphics are definitely on par if not surpasses Uncharted 2 graphics no less. Music fits the game perfect. You have to play GOW 1 & 2 to apreciate the story a bit better. But even if you didnt play the previous God of War games, it can still be understood for the most part. GOW3 for me its the best one in the series, more blood, more action, bigger boss fights and eyecandy graphics. This is definitely the reason to get a PS3 if you haven't already.

God of War 3
The graphics are amazing!  Excellent music and game control.  I've been playing video games for 20 years and have not seen one game that can match the fluid graphics of God of War 3 besides uncharted 2.  No glitches and very smooth graphics when zooming in.  No more pixels!  The water looks like real water. The giant bosses and camera zooming are unbelievable. Excellent lighting effects.  God of War 3 really used the playstation's cell processor to its potential.  Very fast load times also.  <br /><br />PERFECT 5 OUT OF 5!

Hack and slash perfection
As great as I believe this game is, it is definitely overhyped at this point.  I just want to temper expectations and say it is not the greatest game of all time--it is definitely game of the year material.  For all the fans of God of War, you know exactly what you're getting but at a level of polish, detail and scope that has never been seen before.  However, the gameplay is basically the same as the previous 2 iterations, not that that is a bad thing, just that you've been there before, except this time they're throwing more moving parts in there and increasing the resolution.  Now, for all those who are new to the franchise, you will definitely be impressed by the game, but if hack and slash games are not your deal, then you will soon move on once the credits roll.  Expect combos, quick time events, puzzles, massive amounts of blood and gore, and jaw dropping graphics.  Just don't expect a revolution in gaming, because the bottom line is it's GOW 1 and 2 on a new canvas.  With all that said, it is definitely staying in my collection as the showcase piece for the PS3.

Lesson Learned: Don't P***-Off Kratos
The Good, Bad, and Ugly Breakdown of the third installment of the God of War Series (not counting the PSP Chains of Olympus).<br /><br />This being the first time Kratos has graced the PS3 (not counting remakes of course! I'm talking about straight to PS3), it was a very welcome change. The first two were such fun on the PS2 and when GOWII came out it was amazing what the designers were able to do to maximize the look & feel of the game. And when GOWIII came to the PS3, it did not disappoint. <br /><br />__The Good__<br />The visuals/graphics, the gameplay, the moving story and the timing of the flow of the story as it unfolds. The creators had a lot of fun showing your placement in retrospect of where you are. If you're on Mt. Olympus, they'll zoom into show Gaia scaling its walls, and zoom in even further to show Kratos hanging on to her forearm, battling hordes of enemies that have been thrown there. <br />The weapons are a lot of fun and I found myself actually needing to use them at times, and each weapon has a corresponding power. I like the way this was done. When you have the "Blades of Exile" (upgraded from your Athena's Blades from GOWII), you can call upon your Spartan breathren to aid you, and the other weapons have associated powers that can only be used while they are selected. <br />For me, normal difficulty was just right for a first go through. Took around 10 hours or so. And the optional challenges at the end aren't too bad at all, definitely do-able.<br /><br />__The Bad__<br />Won't ruin the story or reveal any spoilers here, but there was an "odd" part in the game towards the end that took a loooong time to traverse. While it is visually interesting/appealing, and the game artists probably thought it would add something to the game to have Kratos swim and swim and swim while in this "different" medium, it took a long time and didn't add anything to the game. Could have truncated the sequence by a couple of minutes and still had the desired artistic/dramatic effect I think.<br />Also, made me wish there were more "fun" trophies to obtain. Most of them you gain just by playing through once and are story related. However, I am playing through again to get the "Nice Tan" trophy (Blind 100 enemies)<br /><br />__The Ugly__<br />There are some very ugly creatures in the game, and Kratos definitely gets to meet all of them... and kill them. Pretty much everything dies due to this Spartan's revenge/wrath.<br />There was a comment uttered while watching Kratos on his path, "Wow, this guy sure is a d**k." There are some jabs at his cruelty in the game, it gets to be quite comical, especially while reading some notes left behind by previous "acquaintances" of Kratos.<br /><br />__Summary__<br />All in all, a very fun game. Very gory (I achieved the "buckets of blood" trophy VERY quickly) and some of the puzzles while playing through can be somewhat challenging, might take a little thinking outside of the box to be able to solve, but most are pretty straight forward with the standard, turn crank / beat the clock. The Labyrinth in particular is full of interesting challenges, including groups of enemies that you have to employ different tactics to be able to defeat.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this game. But also would recommend playing GOW, and GOWII before playing this game to get the full effect and the inside jokes/running gags.

The Ghost of Sparta Returns
Almost 3 years exactly after the release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6SPHI">God of War 2 for the PS2</a>, and on the heals of the release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NN7AKU">God of War I & II</a> for the PS3, finally, comes God of War III. And what a game this is with dramatic visual upgrades to its predecessors in the series. Hard to believe, I know, because I & II looked so good already. But....<br /><br />This may be the best looking game I have ever seen on the PS3. There is so much going on and so much to look at that there is replay value in just that alone. The game is presented in native 1080i (an upgrade from the Collection's 720p presentation), and the picture is just flawless. The game's DTS Surround audio will fill the room and rumble you right out home theater seat. <br /><br />Gameplay, while familiar to anyone that's played the first two in the series, never gets old or too familiar. I'm not a big fan of timed button presses and button mashing; I mostly just like shooting, but man God of War III is fun to play. My gaming horizons have officially been broadened. God of War III is one well put together game. The Quick Time Executions are easier, MUCH easier, than the first two in the series, because the buttons to press appear in the corresponding portions of your TV screen (i.e. a triangle execution appears on the top of the screen, square on the left, etc.). Analog L & R stick rotation QTEs are still a pain in the ash-covered neck though.<br /><br />Remember the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZOL2">Clash of the Titans</a> (with its remake scheduled for April 2010)? God of War III is that but you're IN the movie. You are Kratos, a former captain in the Spartan army and fallen God of War that now sets out to kill Zeus, the ruler of Mount Olympus. The game starts right where God of War II left off, and there will be blood! I'd highly recommend playing the I & II Collection prior to playing III, but by no means is it necessary. You can always go back and play the originals as prequels.<br /><br />The story is well told and flows like a well written book (or movie!). There are tons of cool mythological monsters and you get a fair selection of weapons to kill them with. The repetitiveness of battling some of the same monsters throughout the game is limited by some of the ways that you can execute...well...executions. The kills often look a little different depending on which weapon or brutal attacks you make. Ah, yes, nothing like ripping the privates off of an anatomically correct ogre! <br /><br />After playing so many 'next gen' 3rd person games released for the PS3 (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UW21A0">Uncharted</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1TC0U">Dead Space</a>) I was looking for God of War III to upgrade the controls to be able to look around at the scenery and my surroundings with the R stick while walking and moving around from room to room and during battles. But just like the older PS2 games the R stick is for rolling and evading enemies which is kind of a negative if I had to come up with one. God of War III has added "magical pedestals" here and there (according to the manual, but I haven't found one) that you need to be standing on that allow a full look around, although with a game that's so visually stunning I'm surprised that "looking" wasn't totally integrated into the entire playthrough of the game.<br /><br />My only other complaint would be the relatively long in-betweens from save point to save point. Nothing worse than getting through a particularly tough battle or puzzle only to find that the next save point is still 5 or 10 minutes away, but my loving wife says that it's time to head out to dinner, we're already late. Ever seen a grown man cry? Game makers need to take an example from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NIP3EG">Bioshock series</a> that let's you save anywhere and everywhere!<br /><br />A few complaints have been lodged about the game being too short...about 10 hours for a veteran gamer. But I'm no vet, and even if I was I can't see EVER finishing this game in under 10 hours. No, there are hours of entertainment in God of War III. On the Easy setting one could clock in at obver 10 hours; I'd recommend at minimum the Normal setting because the Easy setting is a walk in the park...even for me.<br /><br />For the few and far between that haven't played I & II, just play the Collection as soon as you're done with III, and after that you'll be ready for another go-around with III. That should take until just about summer, no? And like I said earlier, even if you don't need or want to play I & II, there's a ton of replay value in God of War III. <br /><br />Tremendously fun game. By the Gods, add it to your cart!<br />

This game is INSANE!
I am about an hour into the game and it has exceeded my expectations in everyway. From the very beginning it's like a rollercoaster ride. I honestly can't see how somebody could give this game a bad review!!! I had to make this review especially when I seen the negative reviews. It makes you ask yourself what games do these guys play???<br /><br />Anyway I have played my fair share of games and like everybody else that gave this game a perfect score I know a bad a$$ game when I see it. I have played both the previous God of War games and both of them were great. I knew they were going to raise the bar on this one.<br /><br />If you are a person that enjoys top notch graphics, Greek mythology, kicking some a$$, perfect controls and a good story then this is the game for you!<br />

One of the Best Games Ever!
I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  This game is amazing.  If you don't own a copy, go pick one up!  If you don't own a PS3, go pick up a PS3 with this game!  The graphics are the best and the game-play is so smooth.  Welp, that's all I want to say for now, back to playing GOW3... ;)<br /><br />Oh and one other thing...Playstation rules! :)

Most Amazing Game Ever Made
PlayStation 3 has had some pretty amazing games this generation, however, nothing could have prepared me for the greatness that is God of War 3. The graphics, sense of scale, no load times, framerate that never bogs down, and fluidity of combat never ceases to amaze me. The weapons you ungraciously rip from other bosses' cold, dead hands are all a blast to use, a couple of personal favorites being the Claws of Hades and the Nemean Cestus. The items are are fun to use, and recharge with their own meter, so you don't have to limit their use. The magic attacks are weapon specific and appropriately epic and effective. <br />Epic. That is an appropriate word to sum up this gem of a game from Sony Santa Monica. This is easily the best game this generation so far, with uncharted 2 coming in a (close) second.<br />If you have any doubts about this game, do yourself a favor and play it. Let me know how you feel after the cronos fight. I'm pretty sure you will agree.

EPIC JUST PURE EPIC!!!
After playing God of War 1 and 2 in HD, I was truly curious how one can make improvements to this series. Graphics were already phenomenal. Its heck&slash combat system is very balanced (Not as challenging as Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry games, but also you can't button mash, at least not on the difficult modes). And finally, if you have played 1&2 , you know these games are PURE EPIC. I mean they will take you from heights of Mount Olympus to the depths of Hades. Whether it is Pandora's Box or Sister of Fates, Kratos will finish his objectives and kill everyone in his path in the most brutal way possible providing you ENDLESS ENTERTAINMENT.<br /><br />I mean what can you possibly improve?<br /><br />So I play God of War 3 and man, Santa Monica studio lives up to its name.<br /><br />-MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN GRAPHICS, CHARACTER AND ENEMY DESIGNS<br />Yes my friends. These graphics can go head to head with games such as Uncharted 2<br /><br />-LOVE THE NEW WEAPONS and GADGETS.<br />Each boss you defeat rewards you with a new weapon or a gadget. And this are in addition to the weapons and gadgets you gained in GOW 2.<br /><br />-LOADS AND LOADS OF AWESOME BOSSES<br />You pretty much face all the GODS AND TITANS in this game at one point or the other. These battles are spectacular and very rewarding.<br /><br />-PUZZLES<br />Again, one would think, what can you possible add that was not done in one and 2. Answer is Deadlius. YES PLAY AND FIND OUT.<br /><br />-VERY SAD, YET SATISFYING STORY<br />A great way to finish trilogy. Won't spoil it for you. BE SURE TO CAREFULLY WATCH THE ENDING :)<br /><br />In summary, the GAME IS EPIC. If you played 1 &2  then it is a MUST BUY. If you did not play 1 & 2 then purchase the trilogy. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

Masterpiece-Definitely, Perfection-let's see...
The first GOW game I played was gow2, after I finished I declared it the best game ever. I had some personal problems with it but it was the best game for me. How can it ever be topped? By creating gow3!God of War III is a masterpiece, every element of it was done with the greatest care and precision. Everything about it is stunning and exemplary... I just love this game. Here's why. <br /><br />Story: GOW 3 starts off where GOW 2 finished. Enough about what you've seen in other reviews, what you might not expect is getting a deeper look into the character of Kratos. We know about the past and the motivations of Kratos, in this game we go deeper into his psyche and explore his state of mind as he rages war against Zeus and the rest of the olympians. We see more rage and brutality (i never thought that was possible) and a we get a look at a paternal side of Kratos further in the story. Furthermore this story is tightly-knit. Everything is explained in a coherent manner. Nothing is contrived, gratuitous or left out. It's nice to see that a well-developed story is emphasized in a game like this. It's a simple a revenge story that would be complete without the emphasis, but it just adds to the greatness of this game. <br /><br />Characters: Kratos is bad-ass as ever and I explained what he's like earlier, the other characters and their voice actors deliver top-notch performances. (Except for Aphrodite) I don't know what else to say about them. I'm speechless. I get rage whenever I'm supposed to feel rage against them (especially Zeus) and I'm sympathetic and intrigued when sympathetic characters appear. A++. <br /><br />Graphics: Absolutely jaw dropping. it's hard to tell the difference between a pre-rendered cutscene and gameplay footage. There is no screen tearing,no slow-down anywhere. The level of detail surpasses great PS3 exclusives like Uncharted 2 and MGS4. During battle, when it get more intense, you can actually see Kratos' muscles tense up as he delivers damage. Blood sticks to him and any other enemy when is spews all of the place. (This happens often.) The scale of this game is the crowning achievement of this game. The fighting on Gaia is one of the most heart-pounding fights I've ever had. It looks amazing, it feels amazing, you cannot miss that experience. <br /><br />Gameplay: If it aint broke, don't fix it... Build upon it! That's the philosophy with this game. They raised the level of perfection in this game. It's more fluid, intuitive, and just a hell of alot of fun just killing waves of enemies. Buy the game, see how fun it is, it's worth more than $60.  <br /><br />Replayability: That's not a real word but it should be. You can play this game over and over again with the items and skins you've unlocked and you'll have a different experience everytime. The challenges outside the game are quite hard though, a few are irritating and there is one that is just pointless but it does not diminish the game's greatness.<br /><br />All in all, BUY THIS GAME NOW!! DO NOT MISS OUT ON ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES OF ALL TIME. That's right I said it, ALL TIME! Past, present, future, this game surpasses all! <br /><br />Note:For me there is just one negative. I'm being honest about this game so I have to put up a negative comment when it comes up. Some of the olympians are TOO easy to kill. In the first game, Ares was ridiculously hard to kill. In the second one, you don't kill any olympians (except the sisters of fate) mostly the heroes, and they had satisfying battles (and deaths. especially theseus). In this game, the olympians, (even though they're supposed to be stronger) are killed very easily. I won't give up any spoilers but 2 die by a broken neck and one dies by losing a NON-VITAL  organ. What the hell? That's too easy. Great game anyway. It's fun to watch them die.

PS3 Has goty locked up again
First let's clear the xbox fans outta here, the game is short if you don't look for extra items that need to be found, for enhancement of the 2nd play through. Also stop comparing it to another ps3 exclusive U2 (that's how you can tell) because they compare the graphics. No ps3 fan is going to compare 2 ps3 exclusive titles, only xbox fans. The game is epic. The boss battles are top notch. Graphics are sick to say the least. Storyline is great, (stop listening to ign). Well worth more than a rental and clearly a system seller. Controls are awesome and haven't changed much but what god of war fan wants them changed? If you have played any of the previous installments, you see the enhancements and changes that were made. I had a 360, matter of fact I've had 5(rrod, check the games I've sold on amazon) so no fanboy here, just realism. This game is unbelievable and anybody who plays it, you are in for a truly epic experience. Great job Sony. Xbox fanboys, stop giving it low scores, you did the same thing with U2 and we see how that turned out, GOTY, history is repeating itself.

In one word...EPIC.
Let me start by saying that I have played the other 'hack and slash' games such as Dante's Inferno and Bayonetta and although they are good, they cannot hold a candle to the quality of God of War 3. The sheer amount of action and brutality is enough to amaze even the most jaded cynics, topped with graphics and sound that are on a whole different level compared to any other console games. Some may complain about the length but I do not see any reason why you wouldn't want to play through this game multiple times just for the mesmerizing experience. Not for the faint of heart, there are some intense scenes of violence in this game that would make even the most hardcore gore fans blush. Do not hesitate, pick this game up today!<br /><br />Graphics:10<br />Control:10<br />Sound:10<br />Fun Factor:10

Stop reading reviews.... BUY THIS NOW!
Ok....... This is by far my most favorite PS3 game. Like almost everyone, I have been waiting very patiently for the release of this game. I even went out and bought GoW2 for the PS2 just to play it on my PS3, and I don't even own a PS2 anymore! That's gotta tell you something....... <br /><br />The graphics, the gameplay, the blood, they're all there!<br /><br />Buy this game, I promise you that you won't regret it!<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />The only con I have about this game is the fact that I cannot take off work tomorrow to play it all day! BUY IT NOW!

One of the best game i have ever played. PERIOD.
The graphics are the best ive ever seen, the gameplay is soo fun, addicting and satisfying. The puzzles bosses EVERYTHING just screams epic sauce and quality.<br /><br />If there was a definition for Epic. It would say God of War 3.

Great Game Great Story
Ok, I'll make this simple, this is a great game.  Alot of people are so spoiled with greatness, they forget how to actually have fun.  The graphics are great, the controls are fluid, there are great power up and levels, each boss battle is different and fun, the puzzle arent hard but a great change of pace, and the story is always good.  So the bottom line is people need to learn how to take all that technical stuff out of their reviews and just need to learn how to have fun again.  If you want to have fun, have a good story, with amazing graphics, this is the game for you.  This is my favorite game right now at this moment, I love it :-)

Not just a button masher. This is an instant classic.
I'll keep my review short and sweet. I was very afraid that this game was going to be one giant, no skill button masher like all of the low star reviewers stated. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that you do need a bit of skill to pull off many of the maneuvers in this game. There are lots of clever puzzles to solve and the fights really pull you in and captivate you to make it more than just a "button mashing" experience. The graphics and sound are some of the best the industry has to offer. I've seen screenshots, but you have to play the game and experience it first hand to really appreciate the awesome graphics and frame rate. I have nothing but good to say about this game. It's a destined classic. Even if you're not traditionally into these kinds of games (like me) you should at least check it out. It might really surprise you, especially if you're into mythology, beautiful graphics, top notch controls, superb gameplay, and/or graphic ultraviolence! This is a very colorful title that every PS3 owner needs to check out.

A Great Choice from an Xbox 360 Owner...
Having owned a PS3 and an Xbox 360, I can say without bias that both are great systems and we should all be excited at the competition for this generation of video game consoles.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The 40gb Ps3 comes with increased Wireless and Bluetooth range and reliability, and new components that reduce energy by 32.5% of previous models. The heat difference between this and other models is incredible. This things runs very cool for hours. <br /><br />All PS3 models can connect to the internet for online gaming, shopping, web-browsing, and even medical research for Stanford when you aren't playing. It is nice that the PS3's user-base tends to be older and it doesn't come with a headset, so you don't get much of the 9-year-olds running around screaming during games. And the PS3 has better sound features and hard drive space than the entry level xbox 360. <br /><br />Another huge feature is that the PS3 plays hi-definition movies on a format called blu-ray. I just purchased an HDTV and the picture of Blu-Ray movies is 3D-like and incredible. Games are also played on Blu-Ray discs and several games have already maxed out on Blu_Ray's massive storage capacity. In other words, as HDTV's become more popular, this format will likely become the medium that people watch new movies on. The games on PS3 in the very near future will not fit on the DVD discs that the xbox uses. Another great thing is that the PS3 upscales regular DVD's, which means all DVD's, despite their age, look OUTSTANDING on my television.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />But the 40gb PS3 doesn't get everything right. While the 40gb model plays 100% of PS1 games it can NOT play PS2 games like other models can. But after playing recent PS3 games like Call of Duty 4, I realized I don't want to play my old PS2 games anymore, since they just can't compare to this experience. <br /><br />Second, it doesn't let you keep your music playing once you launch a program, enter the store, or go to a settings menu. And you can't message friends in a game like the 360 can. What's more, Sony's store has a hideous interface (especially on Standard Definition TVs), is clumsy, and needs a serious redesign. The good news is that, it's not nearly as bad as everyone claims and it should get an overhaul this holiday season once Sony launches a new interface. Also, unlike Xbox, the service is free, which is awesome and has caused me to buy several great inexpensive games from the PS store. <br /><br />Another issue is that the PS3 uses new Cell processor technology so developers have to invest a lot of time to learn how to use the PS3. This has meant that the games for both the 360 and PS3 have tended to look much better on the 360 with the PS3 versions being half-hearted ports. However, developers like Midway, Capcom, and many more are starting to realize this problem, get the hang of things, and prioritize PS3 development first. So recent PS3 games like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune are looking spectacular.<br /><br />And finally, this model only has two USB ports and they don't include an HDMI cord OR component cables in the PS3 box. So you HAVE to buy one of them separately otherwise the picture will look terrible on an HD or digital TV. They also don't include an ethernet cable, which was a surprise.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />This generation of game consoles is a win-win and I was on the fence for a year before getting and then returning my xbox for a PS3. The main factors for me were quality assurance, longevity, and value. The PS3 simply feels like it is a more sleek higher end unit. It has never frozen on me like my 360, and has a 1% failure rate as opposed to the 33% failure rate for the 360. Further, the PS3 is projected by many financial analysts as lasting for a long time. The xbox 360 might be outdated by late 2009, but the PS3 has a ton of untapped potential.<br /><br />Several recent exclusive games like Lair, Heavenly Sword, and Ratchet and Clank have looked incredible despite the product being less than a year old. And in my opinion, they look better and have more characters and action on screen than any game I've ever played on another console. And finally, feature for feature, the PS3 is a way better deal than the xbox 360. You get a Hi-Def player, wireless capability, an optional use as a home computer, a web browser, media center, cutting-edge video game machine, and 5 free blu-ray movies if you fill out the rebate form before the January deadline. <br /><br />In addition, the VARIETY of games on PS3 is astounding. There are Playstation Eye Camera games that let your body movements interact with the game, Sixaxis controller games that focus on tilting your hands to steer, the whole gamut of traditional game types, arcade games you can download from the Playstation store, and revolutionary games like Echochrome, Little Big Planet, and the Home social network. There is something for everyone which I feel is a balance that isn't struck as well with the PS3's competitors.<br /><br />While both the 360 and PS3 are great systems, the PS3 definitely is a better long-term investment because it can do so much more than just play video games and will only get better with each firmware update. To put it in two words, the PS3 really is "future proof."

Why I chose 40GB over 80GB.
By now, everyone knows the details of the system. I had to chose between the 40GB and 80GB system. For me, it was easy. I don't need any of the extra features of the 80GB system. (limited PS2 compatibility, extra USB, card reader, Motostorm game etc.)I also didn't need the 80GB because I upgraded the 40GB HD with a faster 120GB HD, and it only cost me an extra $55. The 40GB system also has the 65nm Cell Processor. So for less than the 80GB system, I have a faster, quieter, cooler, and more energy efficient 120GB system.

Very impressed by a current Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii owner
I have both the Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii. I never thought I would buy a PS 3 but after hanging out at the stores to long during the Holiday shopping I ended up buying one. I must say, so far I'm very impressed. Its easy to see why Sony was charging a lot for this when it first came out, this thing is loaded and the fit/finish seems top notch. Compared to the Xbox 360 the PS3 seems very well thought out. The Xbox some days seems like something I built in my basement. The Xbox is so loud when you are playing a game. I can't figure out why MS would think anyone would want to watch a movie through their HD-DVD player as you would have to turn the movie sound way up to block out the 360's fans. <br /><br />The PS graphics are very very good, and the blu ray dvd is just an added bonus to a very good game system for the new lower prices. Also, its nice to have the on-line game play be free, compared to the Xbox $50 a year. It's not that the xbox is bad, the PS3 is just more refined. I also expect fewer problems with the PS3 than the Xbox. I have only had one issue with the xbox, the tv connector cable went bad, but I know several people who have had 2-3 360's just die on them. <br /><br />The Wii shouldn't be compared to the PS3 or the Xbox. Its a great game system with the innovative controlers and the easy to play games. Its the only system my wife will play and she never played games before. That is the beauty of the Wii, it truly is a game system for everyone. <br /><br />So far I see a lot of pro's for the PS3 and a couple of cons. <br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Graphics<br />Blu Ray DVD<br />Wireless internet connectin built in<br />Rechargeable wireless controler<br />Very quiet <br />Doesn't run very hot<br />build quality<br />free on-line game playing<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Not many games yet<br />No hdmi cable included.

The ONLY PS3 would run QUIET enough for movie viewing!
All the news I read said 60GB was the only way to go if you wanted a PS3 with backward compatibility. Therefore, I rush into nearest BestBuy to get a 60GB when I saw online news said 60GB was sold out in most of retail stores on 11/02/2007.<br /><br />I was not very happy when I realized my new PS3 was running HOT and LOUD, believe me it was very LOUD. I exchanged it for another 60GB next day. This one was a little better, IMO; however, it was still running HOT and LOUD. I went to Target, and got another 60GB. This one was not any better. I told myself this had to be a design flaw but I would give it for another try. Therefore, I returned it and bought another 60GB from Target again. Four out of four, they were all running HOT and LOUD. I gave up at this point, and returned the last one purchased from Target. At this point I almost wanted to learn to live with the noise since I enjoyed the Blu-ray so much and had some fun playing those demo games. <br /><br />I went online and did some more research. I found 40GB should consume a lot less energy than 60GB and 80GB. IMO Energy = Heat; therefore, I was in BestBuy again on 11/10/2007 with my family and bought a 40GB. Installed it in the evening, watched a regular SD DVD and left it on over night for downloading. WOW, it ran much quieter and it was even running quieter than my HR20-100 (a DIRECTV HD DVR). Off course, I return the last 60GB I had the following day.<br /><br /><br />My decision metrics:<br /><br />1. Can I watch movies with the PS3 running so LOUD? <br />NO WAY!<br /><br />2. How important is the backward compatibility to me?<br />I can keep my PS2 connected to TV, still; however, I should move on and focus on PS3 ONLY for game playing.<br /><br />3. Do I need two more USB ports and memory card slots? <br />Not such a big deal.<br /><br />4. Is 40GB big enough?<br />I DON'T care.<br /><br /><br />I would buy another PS3 when it starts using 65nm processor rather than the current 90nm in the near future. Now 40GB is the only way to go IMO. I hope my journey to a 'QUIET' PS3 can help you make your decision on your future purchase.

A Leap Forward in So Many Ways!
For all of you considering the PS3 this is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to home entertainment. Gaming and multimedia are taken to the next level. <br /><br />First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with. I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is. The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty. I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome. Connecting the PS3 was the easy part. Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console. Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect. From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs. The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing. You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound. New to any video game console is HDMI output. This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio. HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture. It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound. So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers. On the front end you get two USB ports. This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer. The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times. Which is similar to the other consoles. I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review. <br /><br />I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same. <br /><br />You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3. This allows for each person to go online with their information. Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant. <br /><br />Next is the system settings. This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system. You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v. You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections. The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use. <br /><br />The PS3 also has a photo viewer.  You can download pictures by using your camera and connecting it via USB. I haven't checked to see how viable this option is.  Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature. One of the features takes your pictures and gracefully places them onto a blank canvas. I think the slide shows are best when you set them to music.<br /><br />Next is the music player.  You can download your pics via CD which is rather quick.  I have done this numerous times putting quite a music collection on my PS3.   Although Sony has talked about having downloads via the internet which I think would go over very well. You can listen to music while viewing a feature that uses colors and textures. It is your standard music viewer...nothing special there. <br /><br />I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3. The Bluray player. Most of you now know what a Bluray player is and does. I have viewed numerous movies on it. I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's. One a 1080p and a 1080i. I really did not notice much of a picture difference. After viewing a few movies on the XBox 360 hddvd player and the PS3 Bluray player I really did not notice much of a difference. One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition. Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition. The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier. The regular DVD movies are upscaled on your HDTV allowing an excellent picture. For many of the new movies it is almost difficult to notice a difference in a DVD picture and Blu-ray picture. <br /><br />Now would be the gameplay part of the interface. This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded. This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate. One feature that is sadly missing from the 40 gig is backwards compatibility.  Although you can still play PSone games, PS2 games are a no go.   As far as the games go I have played numerous games plus several demos. The games that are non exclusive like Madden Football are deficent on the PS3 compared to XBox 360 counterparts. The game speed is smooth and polished. The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank is quite impressive. The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces. Game demos like Motorstorm and Gran Turismo HD show what the PS3 is capable of. Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games this holiday season and beyond. I have also enjoyed the few full games that are downloadable. The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99. What I have enjoyed is online gaming. With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees. The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing. I also believe you can use your PS2 headset via USB. The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360. <br /><br />Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3. On the interface online is a big part. From the browser to having friends and checking your mail. Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store. Which is obviously not very unique. The 360 has a market which could be considered the pedigree for consoles. The Wii is limited to just classic video games. The Playstation store is decent right now with very numerous items to download. You have games, demos, and movie trailers. The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP). After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP. Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play. When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP. All you need is a wifi connection. I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable. I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP. The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby. It did not work for me then. Only when the PS3 was on and set for remote play. <br /><br />There are also two features that are becoming more apparent for owners. Folding at Home is a beneficial program that works with Stanford University. The program runs when your PS3 is idle. What it does is run computations that help scientists work for many cures to diseases. A beneficial plus to the PS3. I can vouch for having my PS3 on nonstop 24 hours a day 7 days a week for many months without any problems. Secondly I want to talk about HOME. No not your real home but the PS3 program that will be available early 2008. This program will be a virtual online social interface allowing you to meet numerous other PS3 players. I have been allowed to participate on the Beta version and I must say this has extreme potential. <br /><br />2008 will be an exciting year for PS3 owners. The experience is already excellent with over a dozen very good games. The PS3 will have over a half dozen superb games releasing next year. Games like Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy are just the beginning. If any of these games suit you it would be an excellent reason to own a PS3. <br /><br />In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience. I feel the $400 is well worth it for the features you get. Wifi, Bluray, HDMI, and of course the game playing. <br />I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this. The games are here and the experience is superb. If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.

A Very Awesome System

Just like the 80GB with these differences
See my 80GB review for a full and detailed look atht ePS3, it's capabilities and games. The 40GB was a very smart move for Sony. Let's first address what detracters will say is a problem. Lack of backward compatibility with PS2 titles. First, almost all people who own PS2 games currently, own a PS2. The disadvantage is they can't sell it off and have to support running two consoles. Of course, selling it won't net you the $100 price drop this PS3 gives you so financially it's still advantages. Some XBox owners will use this as a point to detract people from going with the PS3. They fail to mention that the XBox core edition also has no backward compatibility. In fact, it doesn't even have a hard drive. The XBox premium edition has somewhat poor backward compatibility as well.<br /><br />Really, people are buying PS3s to play PS3 games and watch high definition Blu-ray movies. For $399 you get two in one. Back to that in a second. What else in the 40GB missing? It's missing memory card readers. Rarely to people use these. Most people use USB and/or already have a USB memory card reader for their PC which will work fine for the PS3.<br /><br />It also has 2 USB slots instead for 4 but USB hubs are dirt cheap. Lastly, it uses a 65nm process instead of a 90nm meaning the chips are smaller and use less power. This is good.<br /><br />It has all the same movie and gaming capability, built in wireless internet, Blu-ray, HDMI 1.3, etc...<br /><br />So for $399 you get a high definition player and a next-gen console with wireless internet. The cost of this for the 360 would be:<br />1. $349 for premium (20GB) 360<br />2. $179 for HD-DVD player<br />3. $100 for wireless internet<br />Total: $628<br /><br />That's expensive! If you don't need wireless internet you're still paying $528! You might as well go get a cheaper HD-DVD drive on Ebay but of course now you probably have multiple consoles and movie players.<br /><br />Of course the PS3 upscales regular DVDs to 1080p as well so you can get rid of your old DVD player.<br /><br />Some people will argue the games aren't there yet. See my 80GB review for details on that. Here's some quick examples of great games for the PS3 in stores now or released before the end of 2007:<br /><br />I've rated each game from 1-5. I've excluded many games and tried to focus on the games I like.<br /><br />1. Heavenly Sword (Exclusive to PS3) 4/5, incredible game, just too short.<br />2. Warhawk (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5<br />3. Folklore (Exclusive to PS3) 4/5<br />4. Guitar Hero III 4/5<br />5. Eye of Judgement (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5 - Niche audience<br />6. Haze (Exclusive to PS3) Not out yet<br />7. Ratchet & Clank Future (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5<br />8. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (Exclusive to PS3) Not out yet<br />9. UT3 (Maybe for this year) (Timed exclusive to PS3) - only console version that supports PC mods, and mouse/keyboard<br />10. Ghost Recon ADW2 5/5<br />11. Rainbow Vegas Six 5/5<br />12. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 5/5<br />13. Fight Night Round 3 5/5<br />14. Super Stardust HD 5/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $10)<br />15. Everyday Shooter 5/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $10)<br />16. Calling all Cars 4/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $6)<br />17. Super Puzzle Fighter HD Remix 4/5<br />18. Madden 08 4/5<br />19. NHL 2K8 4/5<br />20. NBA 2K8 5/5<br />21. MLB 07: The Show 4/5<br /><br />And there's a lot more to come. For instance Gran Turismo 5 Proglogue is free this year, with Gran Turismo 5 coming out next year. Little Big Planet may be the biggest and most innovative title since Mario and will be out in January/February time frame. And of course there's Metal Gear Solid 4. This game looks incredible and will undoubtly be the biggest game of 2008.<br /><br />Good luck with your purchases!

Very happy with our PS3 - A review by an over 50 game player
I think that I fall into a minority of gamers .. gamers over 50. No kids.<br /><br />This is not the first game console we've had. In the past we've had Super Nintendo, N64, PS1, Xbox and PS2.<br /><br />I thought it might be time to upgrade and step up to the next generation.<br /><br />At first I was not sure I would get a PS3. Certainly a year ago, when it was released in late 2006, the price was too high and downright silly for a game system.<br /><br />Recently I had started looking at the Xbox 360 which on the surface, appears to be cheaper than the 40 GB Playstation 3. However, on further analysis, I realized that the PS3 came with more features "standard," such as wireless network connectivity. Once I started added on the "extras" that would be required to bring the Xbox 360 on par with the PS3, the price of the PS3 seemed much more reasonable.<br /><br />I was surprised that the 40 GB PS3 is not backwards compatible with PS2 games, but that was not a showstopper for us. We don't tend to hold onto games after we play them. We tend to trade them in. We also still have our PS2 which we'll hold onto for a little while.<br /><br />I have to say that now that I have the PS3, I love it. I am using it with a Samsung 40" LCD HD TV. It is fantastic. I have it connected via HDMI.<br /><br />I also have to say that connecting it to my wireless network, a Mac Airport network was incredibly easy. Updating the PS3 firmware via download couldn't have been simpler.<br /><br />I also downloaded and installed Medialink software from a company called Nullriver and am now streaming music from iTunes and viewing photos from iPhoto both from our Macs. The software was only $20 and again, everything was very easy.<br /><br />Right now we are playing "Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction" and "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune" and loving both of them.<br /><br />It is amazing to play games in HD and we really love the wireless controller.<br /><br />So, if you are considering a PS3, we would highly recommend it. We're glad we upgraded and are very happy with it.<br /><br /><br />

40 GB - Best Version available! PS3 40GB. Highly Recommended!
I'm writing a review based on the 2 new PS3 versions available because I'm already convinced this is way better than Xbox 360 in play and value and plenty of other people will do that for you.  Some of us just need advice on PS3 vs. PS3!<br /><br />I think this new 40GB is the Best version available.  Who cares if it cannot play PS2 games, like the 80GB version  -- I didn't drop $400++ to play yesterday's technology.  Save the $100 for a great game/bluray of your choice vs. the included Motorstorm included with the 80GB version which is only an okay game.  Also, I don't really need the extra hard drive space and if I did, I would probably need much more space than the extra 40gb.  For example, if in the future I decide to rip video to it -- I would need much more than the total 80gb and would be looking for an external hard drive solution anyway.  What about 80gb having flash drive slots?  I wouldn't use this and if I needed to there are usb to flash options for a few bucks.  As to the old 60GB version, don't waste your time...noisy, bigger, and gets hot...this cannot be good for longevity.<br /><br />If you buy a game with any PS3 version, I highly recommend getting one that was made in August of 2007 or later.  These 2nd generation games make much better use of the PS3's awesome power and play.  Many older games were rushed to the market.  The good news is that a ton of new games are coming out now and in the next few months.<br /><br />  <br />

My Xbox can be purchsed used on Amazon now!
My Xbox system is now available for purchase used here on amazon!<br /><br />Why? <br /><br />1.) I finally got some serious time in on a PS3 when a friend went on vacation and let me borrow it for a few weeks. My conclusion is that the systems are near identical in game performance.<br /><br />2.) There is significantly less network lag when online gaming with the PS3 compared to the Xbox.  And no, its not just my location because I am using both systems from the same location on the same connection.<br /><br />3.) No online gaming fees!<br /><br />4.) The amount of 12 yr. old smack talk is all but gone in the online games.  So refreshing not to have people yelling into their headset all game long for no good reason (note to Xbox parents- get your children some exercise and a prescription for that ADD).<br /><br />5.) Blu-Ray has apparently won the HD player wars.  Since blu-ray comes included (not as an add-on) this is huge.  It upscales all my old dvds to 1080p and they all look amazing now.<br /><br />The bang for the buck is so much greater with the PS3 that I have to switch. Also when you look at the system potential of the hardware provided, the PS3 will be performing at a much higher level in terms of gaming than the Xbox360 when the game developers start doing their jobs.  My only complaint is that the games available for PS3 are not as extensive as the Xbox360....yet.  But as it seems most new system buyers are going with the PS3 just because of the blu-ray player (it is about the cheapest blu-ray player you can get at the moment and you get an ultimate gaming system included at no extra cost) this should rapidly start to change as the numbers start to balance out between Xbox 360 and PS3 owners. <br /><br />Just my $0.02 hope it helps.

Execellent Choice For Gamers
I just got this and its an excellent choice for a lot of gamers. I think people are getting too much worked over about the Backwards Compatibility. I have my PS2 so I really don't need the BC. However if you do, the 80 GB is still around. Plus I bought this system to play PS3 games. I got Ratchet and Clank with this, and so far I can see why the reviews are stellar. Just an awesome game. Plus the blu ray player is unbelievable. I have a 720p tv so not the greated HD tv but the clarity is really good. The spidey movie with this really showed off the special effects. <br /><br />Now some critics. They removed some USB and memory card readers but for me its not a big deal. I only need one to charge my controller and another one for a wireless keyboard. All though I never planned on using it, some of the other buyers might and should again look to the higher model. But I feel as if this model is perfect for a lot gamers who want to play PS3 games and watch BD movies on the side. Plus its 100 bucks cheaper which I used to get Ratchet and Clank and Rainbow Six Vegas which was on sale. <br /><br />All in all I think this is good model for gamers who are in a similar situation as myself. Who need this to play PS3 games and BDs. I definitely recommend this to any one looking into it.

Sold my XBOX 360 and bought the 40GB PS3
My XBOX 360 had good games and all, but the PS3 is getting all the better upcoming games. I was also worried about the hardware failing and getting the three red lights of death. No worries now. This system is much more quiet than the XBOX, has a sleek look (unlike the bulky 360) and the blu-ray player looks so good on my 1080p LCD. With most of the good games (Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty 4, etc.) coming out for both systems, and the great Ratchet and Clank, as well as, the soon to be released Uncharted, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />I was a huge supporter of the XBOX and the XBOX 360, but now I have joined the "dark side" and I'm glad I did. The dark side is just so much cooler.

Not Xbox or PS3, Xbox AND PS3
Much is made of the decision of whether to get the Playstation 3 or the Xbox 360, as if nobody in their right mind would own both. If you're on a budget and can truly only afford one of the systems, then yes you have a tough decision to make. But very often, people spend $1500+ on their HDTV and hundreds more on a decent surround sound setup, and then get to the PS3 vs Xbox 360 decision as if now is the appropriate time to skimp. If you are into both videogames and movies, it is appropriate to buy both. The Xbox justifies its ~$400 cost with its lineup of exclusives that any self-respecting videogame enthusiast would be sorry to miss, as well as its superior online multiplayer system (Xbox Live). The PS3 justifies its ~$400 cost with its own strong exclusive titles, as well as, and this is very important, its utility as a Blu-Ray movie player.<br /><br />If you have spent a lot of money on an HDTV, it is all going to waste unless you have the high definition content to display on it. An HDTV does not necessarily make standard definition television or DVDs look any better. In fact, play a DVD on your old 32" tube and then on your new 56" HDTV, it probably looks better on the smaller screen, because DVDs are only encoded at 720x480 resolution. HD content, in comparison, is encoded at up to 1920x1080 resolution. Its about 6x the number of pixels, and a day-and-night difference on larger screens.<br /><br />So understanding that you need HD content to actually take advantage of all that money you spent on your HD television, look to what the possible sources are: <br /><br />-HD television: where your local television stations send HDTV free over the air. Also, Digital Cable and Satellite, where for an extra fee you can get your local channels in HD, as well as HD versions of many cable and premium channels such as ESPN, Discovery Channel, HBO, etc. These are all usually broadcast in either 720p or 1080i. Either of which is a HUGE improvement over the old 480i signals.<br /><br />-Xbox 360 and PS3 videogames: these are usually programmed at around 720p (1280x720) resolution, which is again a huge improvement that is very noticable.<br /><br />-Blu-ray disk movies: the successor to DVD movies, these are all encoded at 1080p "full HD". If you want to be able to take advantage of all that money you spent on your HDTV display while watching home movies, a Blu-ray disk player is a must. And a Playstation 3 is probably the best overall Blu-ray disk player in the market.<br /><br />Why is the Playstation 3 the best? Because at $400, its equal in price to the very cheapest stand-alone Blu-ray players, while offering generally superior performance in terms of compatibility, speed, and picture quality. Of those other Blu-ray players you can buy for the same price as a PS3, some will only output 720p resolution, while the PS3 supports full 1080p. Some Blu-ray players will take MINUTES to load disks with complex interactive features, while the PS3s powerful processor will allow it to load the same disk in SECONDS. As far as I know, NONE of the standalone Blu-ray players available for $400 support the Blu-ray 2.0 specification which adds support for online features of disks, including streaming movie previews and content downloads. The PS3 does. <br /><br />So basically, my argument for the PS3 goes as this:<br />-All that money you spent on your HDTV was wasted if you don't have HDTV content to play on it.<br />-Blu-ray is the only way to get HD home video content<br />-Standalone Blu-ray players start in price at $400, but those entry-level models are far inferior to what you get in the PS3.<br />-So in the end, the PS3 more than justifies itself as an excellent Blu-ray player that is also an excellent videogame system. Even if you have an Xbox360 and prefer to purchase most games for it because of the superior online support (such is the case for myself), the PS3 is still easily justified because of the Blu-ray functionality and because it has its own strong lineup of exclusive titles.

Don't wait for the Panasonic DMP-BD50 or the Sony BDP-S550; Just Get a PS3!!!
I'm a highdefinition enthusiast. I bought a first generation blu-ray player, as well as an hd-dvd player. They were both great and got me in the game. After about a year or more I decided that I wanted to get two fully functioning high def players and move on to just focusing on movies to buy. So, before they were gone I got the HD-DVD A35 and now the PS3 40gb. <br /><br />Regarding the PS3 40gb. I really was hesitant to buy a "gaming machine." I waited and waited as long as I could too for the release of either the Panasonic DMP-BD50 or Sony BDP-S550, but after finally testing a PS3 out at a friends house I realized that why waste my time and aggravation. <br /><br />While there are a number of perks that could be said about those upcoming stand-alone players, the bd-java enhanced blu-ray discs are way ahead of the hardware, except for the PS3. There will always be updates down the road to the specs for blu-ray and its extra features. I knew when investing in the PS3 that I'd be safe and could enjoy anything and everything right now. <br /><br />It's cost effective and efficient at doing just about everything. The blu-ray playback performance continues to be refined, and while people may argue night and day between bitstreaming their high-def audio through their receiver it really isn't worth the aggravation. Just get a yamaha 661 I believe, the $399 model, along with the PS3 and go hdmi pcm. It's uncompressed, regardless. And it sounds amazing. <br /><br />Also, with the PS3's most recent update the DTS-HD Master Audio decoding is remarkable, and if you don't get one of those new receivers for bitstreaming you won't have to worry about all of the decoding issues and popping noises that a lot of those most current receivers are experiencing. <br /><br />I can't stress enough how glad I am that I went the PS3 route; those fearing a "gaming machine" and blu-ray quality between the two need not worry. I'm coming from the Sony BDP-S1 and the PS3 is better in performance, especially with the black levels. Sure, I'd like my analogue audio connections for 5.1, but the hassle-free hdmi to hdmi is not only conveniant but far more practical as far as wires go. <br /><br />If you must wait for those new stand-alones because of wanting the latest and greatest or you have the money to spare for the perks then by all means, but if you want to focus on what movies you want and don't want to worry about Profile this or Profile that, as well as the loading times for first generation blu-ray players then jump on the PS3 bandwagon. I don't play games, am a film enthusiast and am glad that I can move on as far as hardware is concerned. <br /><br />The PS3 is everything I wanted and more, and Amazon is amazing with shipping information and delivery time.<br /><br />P.S. One change to this review is that I'd bump it down to 4stars due to the noise of the fan. Even the 40gb PS3's have noise from the fan. If you don't want any noise go with a standalone blu-ray. If you want a game machine and a future proof player, as far as blu-ray specs are concerned, and you can stand the noise of the fan then this player is for you. <br />

Blu-Ray Playback
First, I am not a gamer!!!  My intent was to soly find the best blu-ray dvd player available for the money.  I read several reviews and discussed the item with some individuals I consdiered to be credible.  The amazing thing was they spoke highly of the Playstation 3.  I have had it for several weeks now!!  It is simply amazing (as a player)! I make no judgement as a game console! That I leave to the gamers!!  I use it with the Samsung LNT4671F LCD!! They make a perfect match!!!<br /><br />Larry

Playstation 3 - Review
This is a playstation 3 (40Gb) review - 5 stars<br /><br />1. a HD video player - and all my old DVDs look better<br />2. a music player - solid system sound<br />3. a HD gaming player - love the wireless controls<br />4. a linux desktop - loaded Ubuntu 7.10 with Fedora 8 next<br />5. a 1080p internet browser - enlarges for my 80 year old mother.<br /><br />All 5 for the price of a cheap PC or an expensive DVD player.<br /><br />Bought this at the last minute for the kids to play with on Christmas day. Bought Planet Earth, Motor Storm and Rachet & Clank. <br /><br />I am not a gamer but I and everyone had a lot of fun with Motor Storm, but the kids who like shooting games really enjoyed Rachet & Clank. During dinner - with no sound - I ran Planet Earth on our 42 inch 1080p plasma - and no one could believe the clearity and detail - like we were eagles (angels?) flying over our spectacular earth.<br /><br />Loaded linux Ubuntu/PS3 in a manner of minutes. Like the PS3 its applications are set up for 1080i/p so when an application is run you do not need to squint the eyes. For example the cards on the blackjack game are about 5" inches tall on the 42 inch 1080p.<br /><br />If something is better than this Blue-Ray device - it could not look like real life - because this looks like real life on the 1080p.<br /><br />Oh, yeah:<br /><br />6. And the thing sets up in minutes.

Needed a Blu Ray Player.
When Sunshine came out in theaters, I knew I needed to upgrade my setup to get the full sound experience I had in that theater (since Sunshine will never be on LaserDisc). So I did my research and found that the PS3 seemed to be the stablest future proof Blu Ray player. And with an harddrive that can hold the occasional upgrade, this system will be my only CD DVD Blu Ray player for years to come. I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />**Edit: June 5th, 2008**<br />My system died a bit ago. <br />Allow me to pass on some sagely advice: DON'T TURN IT OFF IN THE BACK! Turns out I corrupted my hard disc and had to send it to Sony to have it fixed. They sent me a coffin and I'm awaiting its return now.<br /><br />Their customer service has been nothing but helpful and have been nothing but helpful. I do not fault the system for human error, it's still a fantastic machine. Just remember, treat it like a COMPUTER not a CONSOLE and you'll be fine.<br /><br />**Edit: June 9th, 2008**<br />Got my replacement console in the mail today. Works like a charm! And just in time for MGS4!

Is going to soon be the system that is remembered in 7th generation...
This is the system of tomorrow. I had serious doubts about the PS3 when it first came out, and I believe Sony rushed it. The game developers weren't ready and the technology was too expensive for the mass market because of including Blu-Ray. If it wasn't for the success of the PS2 and the fact that Sony is a household name, not to mention a rich company, kept sales of the PS3 afloat when it had no great games and was too expensive. Now the price has dropped and the game selection is growing at such a rapid rate that it's killer games will soon outpace those of the XBox 360. The XBox's zenith ended after the Halo 3, Bioshock, and Mass Effect concentrated releases. Now all the XBox has left is Fable 2, while the PS3 is just getting started. In my mind the XBox 360 is not a next generation console, it was a transion console of sorts, just polishing old technology. If there is a new XBox this Winter or Fall, this will most likely be what I consider Microsoft's next generation console. The PS3 is the console with a future, and it is becoming clearer with every passing month. I'm not going to get into the Wii I personally believe it's gimmicky and is just a trend like the Prius. Blu-Ray is also becoming more of a blessing and less of a curse for the PS3, as it's allowing the PS3 exclusive games to include more data than ever imagined just a few years ago. Up to 50 gigabytes and growing! Hypothetically 200 gigabytes. 200! That's 25 times more than the XBox's and Wii's dual layer DVD's! Although the PS3 started off slow, it will soon surpass the XBox 360 and/or it's successor with time. The Wii will, if we are all lucky, will crash in sales like the gimmick it is.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-40 GB HDD (If you ask me, this is plenty, plus you can switch it out for a bigger one)<br />-Blu-Ray (Already a committed user, I love it, it blows DVD away)<br />-No loud fan (The XBox 360 has a very noisy fan)<br />-Built in power brick (XBox 360 has a massive one that takes up precious room)<br />-Sleek design (Nice curves, touch sensitive buttons, glossy black, chrome trim. It looks awesome)<br />-Discs don't scratch (I've had a few XBox 360 games be ruined by scratches, the same with DVD's, but Blu-Ray discs have a super-hard coating that prevents them from being scratched. Love it.)<br />-Slew of upcoming great games (Gran Turismo [looks awesome, even though it's just a prologue], Metal Gear Solid, MLB '08: The Show, God of War 2, Killzone 2, etc.)<br />-Most games are cross-system now (Most XBox games you should be able to play on PS3 as well)<br />-Motion-sensing controllers (Also the new Dualshock 3's with rumble)<br />-Web-Browser (Can surf the web)<br />-Can store a lot of photos and music (I don't think the XBox 360 can even store photos)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Playstation Network isn't that good (XBox live is better at the moment, Sony lacks online experience, XBox started it for consoles)<br />-Expensive games vs. Wii (XBox prices are the same)<br />-That's basically it!

It was worth the switch
I purchased this March 4, 08.  I was one of the Toshiba HD DVD people (and still enjoy the HD DVDs' I have) and have to say I am really pleased with the PS3.  The upconversion is excellent. I have a samsung upconversion that doesn't look anywhere near as good as this blu ray player. The blu ray movies look as good on this player as the HD DVD, I don't see any difference. Also, to top it off, while I have never been a game boy....I am enjoying the games that I can play on the PS3.  As a soon to be 43 yr old it seems a little complicated, however, I can't wait for my 5 yr old nephew to come over and show me the ropes LOL.  The PS3 has been well worth the purchase...keeping me up late at night...!!!!!

Best Blu-Ray Player Without Excessive Lag Time
If you are in the market for a Blu-Ray payer then I would highly suggest a PS3 and also the Sony PS3 Blu-Ray remote! I recently purchased a Sony Blu-Ray player that took 2-3 minutes to load movies and when using the PS3 the same disks only took 5 seconds to load!!  Besides the PS3 has SO much more to offer like gaming and WiFi for latest firmware updates and content downloading.  You can also upload photos via the USB connector and select from one of many templates for viewing your photos! Connecting a USB keyboard for Internet browsing is another option! The internal HDD is a Serial-ATA which can be easily removed if you want to purchase a larger drive for expansion.

Why I bought this over the Xbox360
I am not a huge gamer, I have not bought a gaming console ever, I always played PC games (because the graphics are generally higher resolution and I like Real time strategy games) but this "next gen" series of consoles, i.e. Wii, PS3, and Xbox360 drew my interest.  So this review is from the perspective of not being a "fanboy" of any of the systems.  <br /><br />My first foray into the gaming consoles led me initially to the Wii.  I had an NES as a kid and had a soft spot for Nintendo having spent hundreds of hours playing Super Mario Bros and Zelda.  I ended up buying a Wii back in December 2006 because it was innovative, cheap, and good for playing with friends or at a party.  No doubt the Wii is fun to play and has a lot of potential, but its full potential still seems to be untapped even as of May 2008, which is disappointing.  Sure, there are some new games that are capitalizing on the motion control system, but it seems like at this point, there should be some excellent sports games that take full advantage of the wii remote, and having played many of them, it doesnt seem like developers have really figured out what to do with the wii remote yet.  <br /><br />In any event, eventually I wanted a system that would allow me to use the full potential of my HD TV and the Wii was not it (max resolution 480p in 16:9 format).  The Wii's doesnt' cut it, it just doesn't have the horsepower.  (Not that the lack of horsepower doesnt make it fun.)  So with that in mind, one is left with two choices, the Xbox360, and the PS3.  <br /><br />Why I chose the PS3 over the Xbox360<br /><br />1.  Two Words - Blu Ray.  Now that Blu Ray is the winner of the High Def movie war, the PS3 appears to be a much greater value in comparison to the Xbox 360.  Here is a list of things you get with the PS3, that you do not get with the Xbox 360 Elite (the top o' the line 360)  Blu Ray Player - stand alone blu ray players are still $300 right now.  So for $100 more you get a top of the line gaming console.  If you want a blu ray player, I really dont know why you would buy a standalone player instead of the PS3, especially since the PS3's firmware can be updated regulalry, and is now Blu Ray 2.0 compliant.  The PS3's Blu Ray player is very good, I am sure there are better, but there are none better for $400.  The 360 supported HD-DVD, and had a add on peripheral drive, but since no one is producing movies in HD-DVD anymore, it isnt really going to help for the future.  <br /><br />2.  Built-in wireless networking - the PS3 has built in wireless, the Xbox360, even the Elite, requires a $80 wireless adapter. I still can't believe the Xbox360 doesn't have built in wireless, even the $250 Wii has that.  <br /><br />3.  PS3 uses bluetooth technology.  You can use any bluetooth headset with the PS3 instead of buying a proprietary headset (although the Xbox360 does come with a headset).<br /><br />4.  Sixaxis controller - senses tilt movement, so in games in which you are flying, you tilt the controller in the direction you want to go, very cool.<br /><br />5.  Plug and play hard drive. The PS3 comes with a 40GB hard drive.  However, if this is not big enough, you can easily replace it with any standard notebook hard drive with the same specs.  It is plug and play, very simple.  The 360 uses a proprietary hard drive that cannot be replaced.<br /><br />6.  Low hardware failure rate.  The Xbox 360 is notorious for extremely high hardware failure rates (some say more than 30%) although most people I know that have one have had their hardware fail.  <br /><br />7.  Free online gaming.  Microsoft charges for Xbox live, I believe the price is around $50 year.  Sony's online gaming is free.  Granted the xbox360 has the most established online gaming community in its Xbox Live and is the gold standard for online console gaming For a non hard core gamer, the lack of the well established online community was not a big deal, especially since Sony's is free.<br /><br />Cons of the 40 GB PS3:<br /><br />1. Online gaming community and online service not as established as Xbox Live.  <br />2. Doesn't have the same exclusive titles as the 360 such as the Halo franchise.<br />3. Smaller game library (although this is getting better by the month).<br />4.  Not backwards compatible with Playstation2 games.  (Not an issue for me since I didnt own any.)<br />5.  Only 2 USB ports.

Breathtaking and Powerful Media Centre System
The console market was always about that one exclusive title that was a make or break deal for buying a console. Things have changed and these transformations are important. Brand names in technology used to mean quality but in today's world the same companies get their components from the same parts of the globe that are using the same factory workforces. It is not about components any longer, it is all about architecture, design and implementation. <br /><br />When games developers announced that the 360 was about to get games that were once exclusive to the PS2 console it seemed that the Playstation 3 would be a hard sell especially at its announced price. When Sony revealed delays that amounted to a year and dropped the new design of the controller many thought it would be the end of the PS3 with the sale of HD-DVD format through an early 360 release crushing Blu-ray out of the market. However it didn't happen like that and if anything the tables have turned dramatically. The 360 had two drawbacks. The first was that the hardware architecture was causing overheating problems and the second was that it didn't ship with a HD-DVD drive. That was all the news Sony needed to deliver on a solid gaming rig with Blu-ray... and then much more. <br /><br />It is hard to call the PS3 a games console. It is more like a media centre. In fact it is the media centre that Microsoft wanted us to have, so in many ways Bill Gates has been given a double whammy by Sony. If you want a games console with a highly sophisticated media centre, then the PS3 is the one to get. Let me explain how good it gets. I have a PC upstairs with a lot of DivX, Xvid, DVDs, MP3s, AVIs and WAVs I would like to play on my television. With the PS3, a wireless router and a little time to configure a setup with the free Tversity media server on my PC (you may have to search on the Internet for the right configuration but it goes like this - set PS3 to Wireless with automatic connection, write down the IP and DNS Servers, then change to manual and enter these in manually and disable UPnP. Port forward in the router with the new assigned IP (Ports: 80(TCP), 443(TCP),5223(TCP), 3478(UDP), 3479(UDP), 3658(UDP)). Also in router UPnP check disable. This solves any disconnection issues and your media centre is now up and running). You can watch or listen to virtually anything through this system. I was blown away by how good these files looked over the 54G wireless. It was like watching it on normal television and without any artefacts or frame skipping. The PS3 is also Internet ready with a browser and you can download and install software that runs on the internal hard drive. Then you have social features such as the PS3 community, chat (needs a bluetooth headset), friends and email. There is a way more under the bonnet than just a game's engine. Microsoft has been left standing by what should have been their thing.<br /><br />The controller is more robust than the PS2 controller and has lots of new features. The first is that it is wireless and charges directly from the system (no batteries). There is a new middle button that activates system functions. It comes with motion sensor `Sixaxis' and the L2, R2 buttons have a lovely downward curve feature. You can easily see if your controller needs recharging by the front flashing red lights and having lots of controllers is an effortless affair now. You can also run these wired through USB if you want.<br /><br />The graphics are up there with a high end PC. Playing GTA IV on this machine was a jaw-dropping on the sticky popcorn floor experience. You can download and watch/play trailers/demos from the Sony store. The quality is simply super. Let the best games speak for themselves.<br /><br />The PS3 menu and interface is a substantial improvement from the PS2. It is virtually a feature rich operating system. There are extensive settings for audio and display and networking. It can network with the PSP. You can download updates and patches online including upgrades for the BD player. It makes you feel like part of a PS3 community with a commanding media system in your hands. All of this even before you have started to play a game or watch a Blu-ray makes the PS3 worth it alone. That is why this is a knockout system. The PS3 has done away with the concept that one exclusive title is the make or break deal for buying a console. You buy the PS3 for the PS3. That says it all.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Much more than just a games console<br />Full blown media centre<br />Blu-ray<br />Wireless everything<br />Playstation community online<br />Updates<br />Hundreds of games in development<br />Some really good games already out (GTA IV, MGS4) <br />Online manual is deep<br />The technology is outstanding<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not compatible with all PS2 games<br />It's big and heavy<br />Networking requires some tinkering<br />Book manual is lacking

PS3 40 GB: Great Price,  Great Console. Great Fun.
I just bought a PS3 40 GB, admittingly from a different outlet, but I think its worth reviewing here on Amazon.  First of all, I had the luxury of "testing" my brother-in-law's PS3 60 GB, which had backwards compatibility with PS2 games.  After experiencing Hi-Def PS3 games like MLB 07 The Show, and Resistance: Fall of Man, I can say without a doubt that the clarity of hi-def gaming surpasses the feature of being able to play PS2 games.  I just don't see it as being THE sole reason for purchasing a backwards-compatible model.  And, you will not miss PS2 games all that much because after playing hi-def, PS2 games look blurry and distorted (because the frame-rate is 300 times slower!).  <br /><br />With that said, I bought a 40 GB because of its low price and its built-in features compared to an Xbox 360 such as wireless gaming and free network access.  The wireless feature is so cool because you can download system updates automatically.  And, for the ultimate portability, you can save your game on a flash usb stick and then plug it in your friend's PS3 and pick up where you left off.  <br /><br />As for the hard drive space, 40 GB should be plenty for the casual gamer who plays in spurts 3 times a week (on weekends or days off from work).  If you are a hardcore gamer who is online for hours on end and plans to download wallpaper, skins, and music to their system, then sure, 80 GB might be the way to go.<br /><br />And, there is really no need for an intercooler.  My brother-in-law has one, and the only benefit I would say is that it can speed your gaming experience up a bit if you are playing for more than 5 hours at a time.  Otherwise, it just makes a ton of noise.<br /><br />Recommended games for PS3:<br /><br />Rainbow Six Vegas<br />MLB 07 The Show<br />Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion<br />Heavenly Sword<br />Resistance: Fall of Man<br /><br />

Still best option for Blu-Ray player
I bought the PS3 as my exclusive Blu-Ray platform after judging it with the newest players that came out in July 2008. The PS3 does everything better than the stand alone players that I've seen and toyed with. What stands out with the PS3 to me is the fact that you have a powerful processer that is dedicated to the best 1080P picture posible while decoding the highest quality audio to send to your receiver instead of bitstreaming it to boot. I'll tell anyone that playing the PS3 signal on my Sony XBR4 with 120Hz motion flow and routing sound through my Onkyo TX-SR705 with 7.1 surround will make a beliver out of most audiophiles. what I find most attractive about the PS3 is the fact that it is upgradable to the latest Blu-ray profiles and it decodes the latest audio codecs out there. Sony says they will always support the PS3 with the latest Blu-ray profiles on the market. I own a XBOX 360 elite and a Wii and will tell you that I prefer gaming on my 360 by a thin margin due to the feeling that the 360 controller feels like a tank in my hands compared to the small PS3 controller. I also know that it's just my mind, but I like the quick cut access to the games on the 360 and straight-forwardness of the menus. Now don't get me wrong on this, but I have a higher opinion of the PS3 because of its versatility. I can surf the net, upgrade the hard drive, play HD movies seamlessly, have a million options I can change, and game at the same time. The thing that still bugs me about my 360 is that the HD-DVD player that was an add on never got the full number crunching power that the PS3 puts into its Blu-ray playback. The 360 always had judder because the 360 either didn't have enough juice to power the HD movies or it was taking breaks doing something else rather than dedicating all of its computing power to the movie. I always had studder in the playback of my HD-DVD drive, something that never happens in the PS3. My brother has a Blu-ray drive built into his Dell tower system with enough ram to make a pixar film and Windows Vista still gives you lazy playback and tons of studder which drives me up the wall. With the PS3 upscaling of my old DVD library, it is a complete system that in my opinion outguns anything out there. Way too many positives including reliability to not give the PS3 the edge over anything gaming or otherwise. So do yourself a favor, get a Sony XBR series LCD TV with a PS3 and don't look back or at anything else out there. You won't regret it.

Gaming Plus Bluray DVD Equals A Great Value
I purchased the Playstation 3 primarily as a replacement for my HD-DVD player. I already owned an Xbox 360, but there was no question that the PS3 was a great deal when you look at buying a Bluray player. It's like buying a DVD player and getting a gaming system for free! So, being a gamer I also bought a few used games to try out as well. I have been very happy with the system, and I do like some of the features Sony has built in such as the wireless connectivity right out of the box. I went ahead and updated the system to the newest firmware as soon as it was hooked up. That is a HUGE benefit for any device, but especially a Bluray Player since they will continue to add features, etc... I was never a "fanboy" of the 360, but I had owned an original Xbox (no issues for me!) and then bought an Xbox 360 (RROD on the first one - replaced free). I have noticed now that I am buying new games on the PS3 platform instead of the 360. I am now thinking that since most games come out on both systems, I can get rid of my 360 and save some space and make few hundred dollars as well. So, I have found the Playstation3 makes me happy as both a movie buff and a gamer, and I can't ask for much more than, so if you are looking for a bluray player, the PS3 is a great buy, and if you are looking for a gaming system, the PS3 is a great buy. I think that about sums it up :-)

Coolest and quietest version of a great system
I've had the 60GB, the 80GB, and now the 40GB PS3. The 40GB is best for two reasons: heat and noise. It is the coolest and quietest version of a great system, but it is also cheapest than either (because of the smaller chips it uses).<br /><br />You also save money on power to run the PS3 and electricity to cool off your room with AC. I ran it folding for Stanford all night last night, never got nearly as warm as the 60GB or 80GB did. But I thought those were both very quiet and didn't think they got that hot either.<br /><br />Sure, once the 80GB gets the new chips (could be coming soon), I'd buy that for the USB and larger hard drive and Motorstorm. But you can later attach a USB hub, for about the same additional cost of the 80GB if you need to. As far as backwards compatibility, don't you have a PS2 if you have all those games? And I don't know who would ever buy PS2 games once they have a PS3.

Get ready to rumble, even with PS 2 games!
I was already extremely happy with the Sixaxis controller, but I could not resist getting the DualShock 3. Not only do you get the rumble, but also, it feels much better in your hands, even for those games that do not use this feature. The rumble function is fun, but on top of that, it helps with gameplay, because "feeling" what is happening provides a lot more feedback than just watching how your character or car reacts to the environment. <br /><br />The biggest surprise of all was that the rumble works with PS 2 games in the PS 3 system. I am currently playing through "God of War", a game which had the rumble capability in PS 2. I thought that it was unlikely that I was going to get this feature with this new controller in the PS 3, but it worked perfectly.<br /><br />I know that having to buy a new controller and basically discard the one that came with the system is not the ideal situation, but I have to say this product is really worth shedding the extra bucks.

Tested on Playstation 1, 2, and 3 games - it works GREAT on all of them!
Well folks, now that the dust has settled from the Sony vs. Immersion lawsuit, Playstation 3 owners are finally able to feel the vibe again!<br /><br />I purchased this controller today and I knew the only way to properly road-test it was on the game that made the Dualshock famous, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001X50M">Metal Gear Solid</a>. After booting up the game, I walked down the hallway and got spotted by a guard. As he shouted, "WHO'S THAT?" the controller jumped in my hand - and I knew this was a smart purchase. As the guards shot at me, I felt the feedback of the bullets, just as I had 10 years ago on my Sony Playstation.<br /><br />I picked out another old school Playstation game, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000I1BG">Tenchu: Stealth Assassins</a>. From Ayame's blades to Rikimaru's sword, each sword swipe and jump had excellent feedback.<br /><br />Okay, so my Playstation games worked out. But what about my Playstation 2 library?<br /><br />I popped in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XL3BA">God of War</a>, knowing I had to feel the swing of the Blades of Chaos. The controller vibrations felt a little lighter here, but the vibrations still occurred at the appropriate times.<br /><br />Then I chose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OSLAA">Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction</a>. Who better to test a vibration controller than the Sultan of Smash? All the power jumps and smashes had the vibrations intact, but they still felt a little on the light side.<br /><br />All right, so far I was two for two with my Playstation and Playstation 2 test subjects. But what about my Playstation 3 games? Could I possibly hit a trifecta?<br /><br />I put in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UW21A0">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a> and I decided to jump right into a heated firefight. The controller gave me feedback while shooting weapons and getting hit by enemy fire, but I knew my purchase was justified when Drake was near death: I FELT THE DUALSHOCK 3 PULSING IN SYNCH WITH DRAKE'S HEARTBEAT. It's one thing to hear that noise and know he's near death, it's quite another to feel the pulse in my own hands.<br /><br />Okay, so the feedback on the older games was there, but a little lighter than I remember. The reason? Well, when I decided to go wireless on my Playstation 2 system, I bought a Logitec Dualshock controller. It turns out, that controller takes two "AA" batteries, and the vibration motors inside the controller handles are slightly larger than the ones in the Dualshock 3. That's where I felt the difference.<br /><br />The Dualshock 3 vibrations may be slightly less than the Logitec controller, but it doesn't require the purchase of batteries. <br />The Dualshock 3 may be slightly heavier than the SixAxis, but it doesn't take up any extra space at all.<br /><br />Sure, the price is about $15 more than the SixAxis, but it's a worthy upgrade for the Playstation 3 gamer who kicks it old school as well as new school. The only other drawback is the lack of an additional USB cable - but we can use the one that came with the system itself.<br /><br />So what's the final verdict?<br /><br />Order it, plug it in, charge it up, and get ready for the inevitable downloads from the Playstation Store to make the older PS3 games Dualshock 3 compatible. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend a feedback peripheral without providing my own feedback...<br /><br />Enjoy!

Should've been rumble from the start.
The Playstation 2's highly regarded DualShock 2 controller was considered by many to be the best videogame controller of all time.  So when you've got a winning design there's no need to change anything.  However, because of a legal battle with Immersion over rumble technology, Sony was forced to offer their Sixaxis controller without rumble.  The Sixaxis had the same Dualshock design but it felt too lightweight and cheap.  Thankfully the lawsuit has been settled and rumble has come back to the Playstation.<br /><br />For the most part, the DualShock 3 is almost identical to its PS2 precessor.  But it has all the features of the original Sixaxis controller in addition to rumble.  The controller is still wireless, can be charged by plugging it into your PS3 (or PC), rumble is compatible with all PS1 and PS2 games, and the PS3 supports up to 7 controllers at the same time via bluetooth.  Rumble in the DualShock 3 seems more responsive in regards to the location of its vibration depending on which side you get hit on during the games.  I don't know if this is something in the design or if it's the developers doing it for the games but I welcome it.<br /><br />All in all this is currently the best designed controller on the market right now.  The PS2's DS2 was incredible so "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here.  I'll be enjoying rumble in my PS3 games from now on.

Welcome to the Rumble.
For the past year and a half something has been missing. You don't know what it is but theirs a void and somehow you want to fill it if only you could figure out what it is. You've played Resistance, Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, and Uncharted but something doesn't feel the same. Well worry no more your fears can now be relieved. Rumble is back to bring many of the PS3 best games to life. Granted we shouldn't have had to wait for this controller and its been a painful wait for Sony to settle the lawsuit and get the dualshock 3 into our gamer hands. But at least now its here and without it your truly missing out on that last bit of immersion games have been giving us for many years now.<br /><br />Its not a new feature, of course, but its a necessary one. As a PS3 owner I've missed it and I've taken issue with Sony leaving it out of the sixaxis. No we can have our rumble and feel it too. The controller has a great weighty feel to it. Still includes the motion sensing of the original sixaxis controller. The rumble works on all of the best games, except for Call of Duty 4 but I'm sure a patch will be available in the future. You really can't ask for more. Its rechargable without the need to buy anything extra. Consider all the batteries you don't have to buy and it pays for itself.

Worth the money
This is the controller you should have if you love PS3. I imported one months ago and have loved it. Made Resistance Fall of Man way more fun to play since the rumble puts you more into the game. Drakes Fortune is totally programed around it. Also the sixaxis functions seems more refined in this controller. I noticed it when playing Lair.

Best Controller Ever Made in My Opinion
Honestly, words cannot say how much more I love this controller compared to the Sixaxis wireless controller for the PS3. I actually got my DualShock 3 imported from Japan back in February and have used it all the time on my PS3. I have only played with the Dual Shock for PS2 and PS1 games though and not PS3 games yet since I only have 2 games that do not support rumble for the system. I can say that the Rumbling feature is 100% the same as the Dual Shock 2 for the PS2! <br /><br />First off, the weight difference is significant compared to the Sixaxis. You can tell no doubt which controller is which once you pick up both a Sixaxis and Dual Shock 3.<br /><br />Second, they now have 3 different colors for the controller which is pretty sweet cause now you can buy the controller in Silver, Black, and White.<br /><br />Now, to review on the rumbling itself, well, IT'S AWESOME!!! It's 100% accurate once something happens in a game where the controller is supposed to rumble and it gives you that feeling of awesomeness when playing games that have the rumble feature.<br /><br />The ONLY con I have to say about this controller is that sometimes it can drain the battery a bit quickly, but hey, I would take this controller 100 times as much compared to the Sixaxis.<br /><br />Overall, no doubt this product deserves 100 stars, but I can only give it 5.

Very Happy
What a great addition to an already great system.  Have had the PS3 since it came out.  Got my new DualShock controller today and immedately played ToyHome 2nd Gear.  <br /><br />The new controller is very nice with this game.  When your car or runs into something, you can really tell!<br /><br />I also like the fact the controller is a little heavier.  I think it makes turning the cards a little more realistic<br /><br />

Excellent Controller, but Slightky Different From What I Expected
This is regarding the Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller for PS3.  Let's start off with the fact that the controller works great.  It's got a slightly duller finish versus the original that came with my PS3, and it's lighter as well.  Light doesn't mean cheap though, as I've been using it for about 3 weeks straight with no ill effects.  There's only one caveat though, being that it didn't come with a mini-USB cable like the original controller did(shipped in the box).  Obviously I already had a cable, it's just that there was no mention of this on the Amazon page before I purchased it.  Other than that, I'm extremely satisfied.

Wireless Perfection
If you've used a Sony Playstation at any point over the last 10 or so years you pretty much know what to expect with the Dualshock 3. The size, shape and layout of the DS3 is almost identical to the original Dualshock controller that was released for the Playstation 1. Chances are if you liked using any of the previous Sony brand controllers you'll also enjoy using the Dualshock 3. Similarly, if any of the previous Dualshock controllers weren't quite right for you then you'll probably dislike the DS3. <br /><br />Slight changes have been made to the shoulder buttons and the addition of a'PS' button allows for quick start-up and shutdown of the PS3 as well as access to the PS3 X-Cross Media Bar. <br /><br />The L2 & R2 shoulder buttons are now less 'button' and more 'trigger'. Personally I'm mixed on the new layout. The trigger design works great in certain games such as racing games; but can be less than perfect for platforming or action games. <br /><br />The DS3 features the exact same motion sensitivity featured in the Sony SIXAXIS controller for the PS3. The major addition of the DS3 being the rumble feature. In using the DS3 for approximately 6 months it has become my controller of choice. Simply put the DS3 offers a level of immersion into games that the SIXAXIS cannot offer. The actual amount of rumble varies from game to game and many games even offer the ability to adjust the rumble feedback. <br /><br />Also improved over the SIXAXIS is the feel of the DS3 controller. Because of the added weight afforded by the rumble mechanism the DS3 feels heavier and more appropriate than the lightweight SIXAXIS. <br /><br />Because the DS3 is wireless it relies on a built-in battery to power the controller. Battery life is comparable to that afforded by the SIXAXIS which is approximately 8-10 hours. In my experience charging the DS3 to a full charge takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br /><br />The DS3 relies on Blutooth technology to power the wireless feature. Range is excellent and advertised to be about 30ft. Suffice to say that I've never experienced a problem with regards to wireless range. <br /><br />All told the DS3 is the premier Playstation controller. Well built and sturdy the controller will last through many gaming sessions. I highly recommend the DS3 to any gamer.

Solid Red Plastic Looks Great
I was so pleased to learn that Sony resolved their legal issue with "Dual Shock" rumble.  Now this feels so much like the controller I have grown used to.  It has a good weight to it now and the rumble and new six axis features work very well together.  Actually I had a Wii and the six axis features of the Wiimote (like in MarioKart) seem to be not as precise or user friendly as Sony's are.<br /><br />As for the red color, I was worried it was painted, but no the plastic is through and through red, solid red.  And the red is the God of War red (in my opinion) so it is pleasant on the eye.<br /><br />I am still not very pleased with the L3 and R3 buttons, they feel awkward, but I couldn't really tell you how to better implement these extra buttons either.

The dualshock Playstation controller has been my favorite controller design since it first came out for the PS1. Now that it is wireless with the PS3 it is even better. Nothing bad to say about it.

this controller works perfectly. i recently purchased a much less expensive controller from a supposedly good source only to find it was different than expected and did not work well with my console. the controller that i purchased from amazon is the factory original replacement, made to work with my system, and it works flawlessly. to really save money, buy the correct item the first time for a really good price.

Solid Controller, My Personal Favorite Controller of All Time
When Sony came into the video game scene many years ago with the PSX aka PSOne, they created one of the best controllers ever made.  The shoulder buttons are very comfortable and easy to press within a split second, great for games that require fast reaction time.  The four face buttons are spaced perfectly, and the overall design of the controller fits the hand perfectly.  Sony hit the bulls-eye with the PSOne Dualshock controller, and they transferred this design over to the PS2.  The design was still so popular that Sony could not resist transferring it over again.  The added benefit of the dualshock controller on the PS3 is the added freedom of wireless.<br /><br />The controller is easy to adapt to for Sony console veterans, making the upgrade to the PlayStation 3 even less painless then it already is.  The PlayStation 3 sticks to Sony's winning formula, utilizing familiar buttons, and the same layout as controllers before it.  Players will easily recognize the mapping of the controllers, with trademark "square", "triangle", "circle" and "x" buttons that Sony fans have become accustomed to.  The PlayStation 3 also follows the tried and true method of the Xbox 360 controller by placing a "home" icon on the controller.  The "home" icon is located in the center of the controller, and upon pressing it the player will view the PlayStation 3 XMB.  The XMB is the main navigational source for the PS3, displaying the contents of the console's hard-drive and disc-drive.  Holding the button down for a longer period of time will allow either the controller or the console to be turned off remotely.<br /><br />The controller easily syncs with the console and has a great battery life as well.  The controller also comes packaged with a USB cable that you can use to charge the controller with in case of long gaming sessions where the battery may begin to run low.  The only drawback with this is the length of cable is not long enough to actually allow the gamer to sit at a decent distance from the console while charging the controller.  Replacing and upgrading the chord with one of a better length is a wise choice, and one that I highly recommend.  <br /><br />The Dualshock 3 returns to the heavier weight that players are used to feeling from the controllers; ditching the lightweight design of the Six Axis.  This makes the controller "feel" better to hold, making it sturdier as well.  The major reason that I prefer this controller overall the other controllers that have been released is because of the directional pad.  The d-pad is perfect on the Sony controllers.  It allows for precision and accuracy in every genre of gaming.  I was disappointed when Sony launched the PS3 and its controller lacked rumble capability, however, with this new release the Dualshock design is back and better than ever.

New Colors Options Amazing
I purchased both the Red color and the Blue Color (at the time of this writing only the blue one has arrived).<br /><br />I must say that the Metallic Blue Dual Shock 3 looks more impressive in person than the image seems to convey.  The image doesnt convey the fact that it is metallic blue.  Metallic blue in this case means that the actually controlloer looks almost nearly like a dark shade of blue but has the "subtle sparks" in it that makes it shimmer and shine when one rotates it around in the lighting.<br /><br />Performance wise it is the same that we expect with all of our DualShock 3's.  Perfect feel for comfort, strong vibrant vibration, and great sixaxis motion control translation (on games that support them). <br /><br />The only other minor thing is that the "DualShock 3" logo and the "Sixaxis" logo are in a brighter blue on that front end of the DualShock 3.  I dont think it adds or distracts from the aesthetics since it is in an odd position on the DualShock 3 for this Metallic Blue color.<br /><br />EDIT:  Deep Red Color arrived today and it looks exactly like the picture.  Saying deep red is quite a stretch for it is a brilliant red but doesnt look quite luminous. <br /><br /><br />These are a worthwhile purchase if you want to add a DualShock 3 color other than Black to your collection.

Perfect.
Again...not much more detail I can provide in a review....<br />These are the real deal and built well by Sony.<br />Amazon pricing is much better then retail...and with low shipping costs and savings on TAX...this is the place to buy em.<br />

Works like the Dualshock 2 but wireless
This is a sturdy controller made by Sony, and is the official controller.  It is bluetooth, syncs instantly, and works with all games.  Not all games will be dualshock vibration compatible, but the controller works with all games on the PS3.  <br /><br />When playing vibration intensive games like Call of Duty World at War, you will feel how great and powerful the vibration is.  The constant gunfire will vibrate till your hands get numb. <br /><br /> If you are looking to get another PS3 controller, get the Sony made one.  It's trusted, and guaranteed to work.

Classics die hard
Who didn't cringe a bit when Sony unveiled the unsightly, boomerang controller with the PS3, oh so many years ago?  So when it was revealed that the controller was going to be the same shape & function as the DualShock 2, I let out a huge sigh of relief.  But my relief was tempered by the announcement that there was to be no 'shock' in the new wireless controller.  "Oh well," I thought, "At least it still 'looks' like the dual shock."  But then I heard that the reason for no 'shock' was that it wasn't compatible with the sixaxis feature.  Now I'm no electronics engineer, but I know enough to know that there are ways to counter such incompatibilities.  <br /><br />I thought correctly when they released the DualShock 3, Sony's next gen gamer's Excalibur.  Same awesome design that fits oh so perfectly in my hand, same game enhancing vibration function as the DS2, and now with the sixaxis control feature & it's wireless!  What more do I need to say about it?  Sure there are other after market controllers out there for less money, but why?

Rumble is Back !!
Finally the dualshock is back, and this time better than ever (wireless, with sixaxis). There is no doubt the rumble adds alot of fun to gameplay. The controller itself is heavier and feels just right. I didn't notice any problems in battery life, got about 8 hours so far and still has full bars. This also works with all PS1/PS2 games (requires firmware 2.00).  I tried this with uncharted and warhawk so far, both games uses the rumble feature perfectly.  Even though i beat uncharted already, this time i really found it a lot better with rumble. I reccomend this for all PS3 owners, and especially if you're getting the one and only MGS4.

Rumble, The ONLY Way To Go!
I just got my Dualshock 3 Controller today and let me tell you it was everything I had hoped for! The weight is so much better than the Sixaxis Controller, I feel like im holding a real controller not a lite weight piece of junk. As for the Rumble Feature.... it's Perfect! It Added so much more of a connection to the game when I was playing Warhawk today, feeling the recoil of the weapons really gave me a rush and also let me know what I was missing without the Rumble Feature. In Short don't waste time, go drop the $55.00 and get what you should of when you first purchased your PS3!

It's one thing to hear that noise and know he's near death, it's quite another to feel the pulse in my own hands.<br /><br />Okay, so the feedback on the older games was there, but a little lighter than I remember. The reason? Well, when I decided to go wireless on my Playstation 2 system, I bought a Logitec Dualshock controller. It turns out, that controller takes two "AA" batteries, and the vibration motors inside the controller handles are slightly larger than the ones in the Dualshock 3. That's where I felt the difference.<br /><br />The Dualshock 3 vibrations may be slightly less than the Logitec controller, but it doesn't require the purchase of batteries. <br />The Dualshock 3 may be slightly heavier than the SixAxis, but it doesn't take up any extra space at all.<br /><br />Sure, the price is about $15 more than the SixAxis, but it's a worthy upgrade for the Playstation 3 gamer who kicks it old school as well as new school. The only other drawback is the lack of an additional USB cable - but we can use the one that came with the system itself.<br /><br />So what's the final verdict?<br /><br />Order it, plug it in, charge it up, and get ready for the inevitable downloads from the Playstation Store to make the older PS3 games Dualshock 3 compatible. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend a feedback peripheral without providing my own feedback...<br /><br />Enjoy!

Should've been rumble from the start.
The Playstation 2's highly regarded DualShock 2 controller was considered by many to be the best videogame controller of all time.  So when you've got a winning design there's no need to change anything.  However, because of a legal battle with Immersion over rumble technology, Sony was forced to offer their Sixaxis controller without rumble.  The Sixaxis had the same Dualshock design but it felt too lightweight and cheap.  Thankfully the lawsuit has been settled and rumble has come back to the Playstation.<br /><br />For the most part, the DualShock 3 is almost identical to its PS2 precessor.  But it has all the features of the original Sixaxis controller in addition to rumble.  The controller is still wireless, can be charged by plugging it into your PS3 (or PC), rumble is compatible with all PS1 and PS2 games, and the PS3 supports up to 7 controllers at the same time via bluetooth.  Rumble in the DualShock 3 seems more responsive in regards to the location of its vibration depending on which side you get hit on during the games.  I don't know if this is something in the design or if it's the developers doing it for the games but I welcome it.<br /><br />All in all this is currently the best designed controller on the market right now.  The PS2's DS2 was incredible so "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here.  I'll be enjoying rumble in my PS3 games from now on.

Welcome to the Rumble.
For the past year and a half something has been missing. You don't know what it is but theirs a void and somehow you want to fill it if only you could figure out what it is. You've played Resistance, Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, and Uncharted but something doesn't feel the same. Well worry no more your fears can now be relieved. Rumble is back to bring many of the PS3 best games to life. Granted we shouldn't have had to wait for this controller and its been a painful wait for Sony to settle the lawsuit and get the dualshock 3 into our gamer hands. But at least now its here and without it your truly missing out on that last bit of immersion games have been giving us for many years now.<br /><br />Its not a new feature, of course, but its a necessary one. As a PS3 owner I've missed it and I've taken issue with Sony leaving it out of the sixaxis. No we can have our rumble and feel it too. The controller has a great weighty feel to it. Still includes the motion sensing of the original sixaxis controller. The rumble works on all of the best games, except for Call of Duty 4 but I'm sure a patch will be available in the future. You really can't ask for more. Its rechargable without the need to buy anything extra. Consider all the batteries you don't have to buy and it pays for itself.

Worth the money
This is the controller you should have if you love PS3. I imported one months ago and have loved it. Made Resistance Fall of Man way more fun to play since the rumble puts you more into the game. Drakes Fortune is totally programed around it. Also the sixaxis functions seems more refined in this controller. I noticed it when playing Lair.

Best Controller Ever Made in My Opinion
Honestly, words cannot say how much more I love this controller compared to the Sixaxis wireless controller for the PS3. I actually got my DualShock 3 imported from Japan back in February and have used it all the time on my PS3. I have only played with the Dual Shock for PS2 and PS1 games though and not PS3 games yet since I only have 2 games that do not support rumble for the system. I can say that the Rumbling feature is 100% the same as the Dual Shock 2 for the PS2! <br /><br />First off, the weight difference is significant compared to the Sixaxis. You can tell no doubt which controller is which once you pick up both a Sixaxis and Dual Shock 3.<br /><br />Second, they now have 3 different colors for the controller which is pretty sweet cause now you can buy the controller in Silver, Black, and White.<br /><br />Now, to review on the rumbling itself, well, IT'S AWESOME!!! It's 100% accurate once something happens in a game where the controller is supposed to rumble and it gives you that feeling of awesomeness when playing games that have the rumble feature.<br /><br />The ONLY con I have to say about this controller is that sometimes it can drain the battery a bit quickly, but hey, I would take this controller 100 times as much compared to the Sixaxis.<br /><br />Overall, no doubt this product deserves 100 stars, but I can only give it 5.

Very Happy
What a great addition to an already great system.  Have had the PS3 since it came out.  Got my new DualShock controller today and immedately played ToyHome 2nd Gear.  <br /><br />The new controller is very nice with this game.  When your car or runs into something, you can really tell!<br /><br />I also like the fact the controller is a little heavier.  I think it makes turning the cards a little more realistic<br /><br />

Excellent Controller, but Slightky Different From What I Expected
This is regarding the Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller for PS3.  Let's start off with the fact that the controller works great.  It's got a slightly duller finish versus the original that came with my PS3, and it's lighter as well.  Light doesn't mean cheap though, as I've been using it for about 3 weeks straight with no ill effects.  There's only one caveat though, being that it didn't come with a mini-USB cable like the original controller did(shipped in the box).  Obviously I already had a cable, it's just that there was no mention of this on the Amazon page before I purchased it.  Other than that, I'm extremely satisfied.

Wireless Perfection
If you've used a Sony Playstation at any point over the last 10 or so years you pretty much know what to expect with the Dualshock 3. The size, shape and layout of the DS3 is almost identical to the original Dualshock controller that was released for the Playstation 1. Chances are if you liked using any of the previous Sony brand controllers you'll also enjoy using the Dualshock 3. Similarly, if any of the previous Dualshock controllers weren't quite right for you then you'll probably dislike the DS3. <br /><br />Slight changes have been made to the shoulder buttons and the addition of a'PS' button allows for quick start-up and shutdown of the PS3 as well as access to the PS3 X-Cross Media Bar. <br /><br />The L2 & R2 shoulder buttons are now less 'button' and more 'trigger'. Personally I'm mixed on the new layout. The trigger design works great in certain games such as racing games; but can be less than perfect for platforming or action games. <br /><br />The DS3 features the exact same motion sensitivity featured in the Sony SIXAXIS controller for the PS3. The major addition of the DS3 being the rumble feature. In using the DS3 for approximately 6 months it has become my controller of choice. Simply put the DS3 offers a level of immersion into games that the SIXAXIS cannot offer. The actual amount of rumble varies from game to game and many games even offer the ability to adjust the rumble feedback. <br /><br />Also improved over the SIXAXIS is the feel of the DS3 controller. Because of the added weight afforded by the rumble mechanism the DS3 feels heavier and more appropriate than the lightweight SIXAXIS. <br /><br />Because the DS3 is wireless it relies on a built-in battery to power the controller. Battery life is comparable to that afforded by the SIXAXIS which is approximately 8-10 hours. In my experience charging the DS3 to a full charge takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br /><br />The DS3 relies on Blutooth technology to power the wireless feature. Range is excellent and advertised to be about 30ft. Suffice to say that I've never experienced a problem with regards to wireless range. <br /><br />All told the DS3 is the premier Playstation controller. Well built and sturdy the controller will last through many gaming sessions. I highly recommend the DS3 to any gamer.

Solid Red Plastic Looks Great
I was so pleased to learn that Sony resolved their legal issue with "Dual Shock" rumble.  Now this feels so much like the controller I have grown used to.  It has a good weight to it now and the rumble and new six axis features work very well together.  Actually I had a Wii and the six axis features of the Wiimote (like in MarioKart) seem to be not as precise or user friendly as Sony's are.<br /><br />As for the red color, I was worried it was painted, but no the plastic is through and through red, solid red.  And the red is the God of War red (in my opinion) so it is pleasant on the eye.<br /><br />I am still not very pleased with the L3 and R3 buttons, they feel awkward, but I couldn't really tell you how to better implement these extra buttons either.

It's a controller, what can you say?
The dualshock Playstation controller has been my favorite controller design since it first came out for the PS1. Now that it is wireless with the PS3 it is even better. Nothing bad to say about it.

you get what you pay for
this controller works perfectly. i recently purchased a much less expensive controller from a supposedly good source only to find it was different than expected and did not work well with my console. the controller that i purchased from amazon is the factory original replacement, made to work with my system, and it works flawlessly. to really save money, buy the correct item the first time for a really good price.

Solid Controller, My Personal Favorite Controller of All Time
When Sony came into the video game scene many years ago with the PSX aka PSOne, they created one of the best controllers ever made.  The shoulder buttons are very comfortable and easy to press within a split second, great for games that require fast reaction time.  The four face buttons are spaced perfectly, and the overall design of the controller fits the hand perfectly.  Sony hit the bulls-eye with the PSOne Dualshock controller, and they transferred this design over to the PS2.  The design was still so popular that Sony could not resist transferring it over again.  The added benefit of the dualshock controller on the PS3 is the added freedom of wireless.<br /><br />The controller is easy to adapt to for Sony console veterans, making the upgrade to the PlayStation 3 even less painless then it already is.  The PlayStation 3 sticks to Sony's winning formula, utilizing familiar buttons, and the same layout as controllers before it.  Players will easily recognize the mapping of the controllers, with trademark "square", "triangle", "circle" and "x" buttons that Sony fans have become accustomed to.  The PlayStation 3 also follows the tried and true method of the Xbox 360 controller by placing a "home" icon on the controller.  The "home" icon is located in the center of the controller, and upon pressing it the player will view the PlayStation 3 XMB.  The XMB is the main navigational source for the PS3, displaying the contents of the console's hard-drive and disc-drive.  Holding the button down for a longer period of time will allow either the controller or the console to be turned off remotely.<br /><br />The controller easily syncs with the console and has a great battery life as well.  The controller also comes packaged with a USB cable that you can use to charge the controller with in case of long gaming sessions where the battery may begin to run low.  The only drawback with this is the length of cable is not long enough to actually allow the gamer to sit at a decent distance from the console while charging the controller.  Replacing and upgrading the chord with one of a better length is a wise choice, and one that I highly recommend.  <br /><br />The Dualshock 3 returns to the heavier weight that players are used to feeling from the controllers; ditching the lightweight design of the Six Axis.  This makes the controller "feel" better to hold, making it sturdier as well.  The major reason that I prefer this controller overall the other controllers that have been released is because of the directional pad.  The d-pad is perfect on the Sony controllers.  It allows for precision and accuracy in every genre of gaming.  I was disappointed when Sony launched the PS3 and its controller lacked rumble capability, however, with this new release the Dualshock design is back and better than ever.

New Colors Options Amazing
I purchased both the Red color and the Blue Color (at the time of this writing only the blue one has arrived).<br /><br />I must say that the Metallic Blue Dual Shock 3 looks more impressive in person than the image seems to convey.  The image doesnt convey the fact that it is metallic blue.  Metallic blue in this case means that the actually controlloer looks almost nearly like a dark shade of blue but has the "subtle sparks" in it that makes it shimmer and shine when one rotates it around in the lighting.<br /><br />Performance wise it is the same that we expect with all of our DualShock 3's.  Perfect feel for comfort, strong vibrant vibration, and great sixaxis motion control translation (on games that support them). <br /><br />The only other minor thing is that the "DualShock 3" logo and the "Sixaxis" logo are in a brighter blue on that front end of the DualShock 3.  I dont think it adds or distracts from the aesthetics since it is in an odd position on the DualShock 3 for this Metallic Blue color.<br /><br />EDIT:  Deep Red Color arrived today and it looks exactly like the picture.  Saying deep red is quite a stretch for it is a brilliant red but doesnt look quite luminous. <br /><br /><br />These are a worthwhile purchase if you want to add a DualShock 3 color other than Black to your collection.

Perfect.
Again...not much more detail I can provide in a review....<br />These are the real deal and built well by Sony.<br />Amazon pricing is much better then retail...and with low shipping costs and savings on TAX...this is the place to buy em.<br />

Works like the Dualshock 2 but wireless
This is a sturdy controller made by Sony, and is the official controller.  It is bluetooth, syncs instantly, and works with all games.  Not all games will be dualshock vibration compatible, but the controller works with all games on the PS3.  <br /><br />When playing vibration intensive games like Call of Duty World at War, you will feel how great and powerful the vibration is.  The constant gunfire will vibrate till your hands get numb. <br /><br /> If you are looking to get another PS3 controller, get the Sony made one.  It's trusted, and guaranteed to work.

Classics die hard
Who didn't cringe a bit when Sony unveiled the unsightly, boomerang controller with the PS3, oh so many years ago?  So when it was revealed that the controller was going to be the same shape & function as the DualShock 2, I let out a huge sigh of relief.  But my relief was tempered by the announcement that there was to be no 'shock' in the new wireless controller.  "Oh well," I thought, "At least it still 'looks' like the dual shock."  But then I heard that the reason for no 'shock' was that it wasn't compatible with the sixaxis feature.  Now I'm no electronics engineer, but I know enough to know that there are ways to counter such incompatibilities.  <br /><br />I thought correctly when they released the DualShock 3, Sony's next gen gamer's Excalibur.  Same awesome design that fits oh so perfectly in my hand, same game enhancing vibration function as the DS2, and now with the sixaxis control feature & it's wireless!  What more do I need to say about it?  Sure there are other after market controllers out there for less money, but why?

Rumble is Back !!
Finally the dualshock is back, and this time better than ever (wireless, with sixaxis). There is no doubt the rumble adds alot of fun to gameplay. The controller itself is heavier and feels just right. I didn't notice any problems in battery life, got about 8 hours so far and still has full bars. This also works with all PS1/PS2 games (requires firmware 2.00).  I tried this with uncharted and warhawk so far, both games uses the rumble feature perfectly.  Even though i beat uncharted already, this time i really found it a lot better with rumble. I reccomend this for all PS3 owners, and especially if you're getting the one and only MGS4.

This is a  very good, good, good controller

Rumble, The ONLY Way To Go!
I just got my Dualshock 3 Controller today and let me tell you it was everything I had hoped for! The weight is so much better than the Sixaxis Controller, I feel like im holding a real controller not a lite weight piece of junk. As for the Rumble Feature.... it's Perfect! It Added so much more of a connection to the game when I was playing Warhawk today, feeling the recoil of the weapons really gave me a rush and also let me know what I was missing without the Rumble Feature. In Short don't waste time, go drop the $55.00 and get what you should of when you first purchased your PS3!

Speechless...
I don't quite know how to describe how great this game really is...I just sat down for 15 hours straight and couldn't put the controller down until the end of the credits. This game combines everything and anything you could ever want in a movie, a game or any entertainment experience. Uncharted 2 has incredible characters, wonderful story, some of the best acting I've ever seen (Not just the voice acting, but the actual animations of the characters, their facial expressions), everything is done so beautifully I'm absolutely speechless. Among Thieves exceeded the hype in my mind, it immerses you in this incredibly detailed and lush environment, seamlessly bouncing you back and forth from gameplay to breathtaking cinematic wonder, and most often, combines them both at the same time. Just the attention to detail is astounding. I wish I had a better vocabulary so I could give this review justice but you should just see for yourself! You will not regret this purchase one bit, the multiplayer is even fun! If you own a PS3 and don't have this game, then you should sell your PS3.

Worth Buying A Playstation 3 for!
I'm sure if you're reading this you've already read countless other reviews praising the game for it's superb voice acting, mind blowing graphics, wonderful story telling, and it's riveting gameplay. I'm only writing this to enforce all of these things and hopefully tip you over the fence into buying this game immediately. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves contains almost every element that was in the first and improves upon it. For those of you who haven't played the first game it is essentially  Gears of War meets Tomb Raider + Awesomeness all rolled into one. For those of you who did play Uncharted: Drake's Fortune you're all too aware of how short the first game was and I'm pleased to tell you that this game is substantially worth it. Not only does it last about 3-4 hours longer buy it features something to do when you're done, multiplayer. The multiplayer is essentially what you'd expect from Call of Duty 4 with and a 3rd person twist and several unique modes to shake up the formula. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is like buying a three entree plate from Panda Express. It leaves you completely full and satisfied and although you'd happily enjoy another serving of Orange Chicken you can leave the restaurant knowing you got what you paid for. Buy this game and enjoy it because although it's built upon the qualities of other games, there's really nothing out there quite like it.

One of the best on the PS3
I promise to make this 100% Spoiler free, but I must say that after experiencing that which is Uncharted 2, this game is pretty solid indeed.  If you enjoyed the first Uncharted then this one will be an extremely enjoyable experience.  This game lasts more than 2-4 hours longer than the previous one, tops the cake for having some of the best cinematics, graphics, and sound experience offered on the PS3.  <br /><br />One of the features that I was a bit weary about was the multiplayer because I do not really consider myself a multiplayer fan,however, I must say that that which is in Uncharted 2 is enough to last those who just like multiplayer games a long time. There doesnt seem to be anyway to do offline multiplayer however, for an experience online (with up to 3 player co-op), and about 10 people in the deathmatch modes, there is little to crave.  It seems that they developed an amazing Single player experience and added a great multiplayer experience.<br /><br />Ultimately, with a heartpounding action packed story, a landmark presentation value, and exciting multiplayer and single player modes, I can not really find anything to criticize the game for. (well perhaps the most criticism would be the amount of logo's on the back of the boxart, or even the at times difficulty of AI).<br /><br />One more thing, the game has trophy support, headset support, (upcoming twitter support), a multiplayer shop system (to buy skins, and boosts), future DLC, and unlockables.<br /><br />Please add this game to your PS3 library.

Fall in Love with your PS3 All Over Again
It's been a couple of weeks since the bomb that is Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has dropped. Did you get caught in its blast? Or have you avoided its fallout? If you have then I say what the hell are you waiting for?? Go get contaminated!<br /><br />It's not all the time a game like Uncharted 2 comes around. A game that will say hello to you, then grab you by the neck and slam you around the room a few times, stop, then kiss you a bit and get you all emotionally connected only to take your lips 2 minutes later and tuck them between your legs and pull them up over your ass so fast it'll make your head spin right off your neck. Ok, so that won't literally happen, but if you were to take that energy, passion, climactic intensity, and overall jaw dropping action and crush it all up into one neat little ball of beauty, power, and downright coolness, then you my friend might as well call that little ball Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.<br /><br />You should know the story by now. You're the hero, who goes on a journey of personal fulfillment, only to find yourself in a situation where you have to save to world. It may sound big scale because it is. The way the game starts equals that of most Hollywood blockbusters. And know, that it does not let up. <br /><br />From start to finish all you will find yourself doing is sitting on the edge of your seat wanting more and more. It has been said that this is not a game, but more like an interactive movie. The nail couldn't have been hit more dead on. The way the story rolls with sequences that take control for seconds at a time and are so fluid you don't even realize you're back in control of the character are amazing to watch. The timing of the action, the dialogue, the scenery, there is absolutely nothing small about this game and it let's you know that with every shoot out, car explosion and helicopter chase. The level of detail from a murky jungle to the ruins of a lost city, would be done no justice by explaining them with nothing but simple words. The character designs, not just the way they look, but their attitudes, their demeanor, the way they act and the things they do, all will leave you loving, hating, laughing and mourning with every step they take, every thing they do and every word they say. <br /><br />There are moments where you're hurt and can't run at full speed. Moments where you'll be dragging someone around and you feel it in the way you walk, you feel the tense moments of trying to shoot someone with your one free hand. It's almost as if the people of Naughty Dog sat down and asked what would be the most over the top things to experience in a game? And amazingly, without a lack of polish, or quality, they managed to have you saying "no effing way, did that just happen?!" over and over again.<br /><br />Now, being over the top is not necessarily a good thing. But when it's scripted moments that when thought about, you can actually see happening in the given situation, then over the top is definitely a good thing. Thinking realistically, the outcome may not always be the hero coming out unscathed, but then again, like I said, this is a Hollywood blockbuster type game. So don't expect anything less. <br /><br />Now, as far as negatives go. It really is hard to sit and look for something bad in something so good. But being on the last leg of my second playthrough of this averaged 10-12 hour game, I can honestly say there is almost nothing I can point out and say this is a flaw. I'd love to sit here and say there is but there really isn't. The only solitary thing I noticed on my second playthrough is the issue of trying to take cover on a wall when it is right next to another wall. The proximity of the two walls make it a little difficult to attach yourself to the one you want to if you're not looking at it at the right angle and it can leave you open for a serious hurting at the wrong time. But like I said, that was noticed on my second playthrough so it's not even really a problem or issue, more of a gripe. Other than that there are people who will nit pick and say something wasn't rendered right or say that's B.S., that can't ever really happen, but when it comes down to it, as far as gameplay, mechanics, background environments, and story go, this package is virtually flawless. The flaws of the first game have been fixed and improved upon, the animation is on point and like I said, the characters make you feel like you know them. I can promise you, if you enjoy playing video games, and enjoy a story driven experience then there is nothing that will stop you from loving this game. <br /><br />Now, as far as multiplayer goes, I've given my impressions on it before. You can find it here: [...]. And it all still stands. The multiplayer mode of this single player monster was always worried about. But in the end it turned out to be a solid piece of work that surprised a lot of people. It's fun, it's addicting, easy to get used to and full of things to unlock and use. It captures the essence of the single player experience amazingly well and you can't help but feel like you walked out of the store buying 2 games for the price of 1. The only problem with the multiplayer is that more than likely, by the time you read this, a monstrous behemoth of the multiplayer world known as Modern Warfare 2 would have came out. And no matter how amazingly great the multiplayer of Uncharted 2 is, there are few that will be able to contend with the likes of what Infinity Ward is going to bring to the online table. And it's because of that fact this aspect of the game will be considered a lost gem for online players in the near future.<br /><br />Ok. You've seen the videos, you've read the reviews, and heard the praise. I'm telling you nothing different. Since day one I've had the pleasure of enjoying Uncharted 2 and couldn't be happier. I know this is more of a commercial than a review but it is so hard not to love this game, and even harder to find something wrong with it. Everything I've said is as close to the truth as I know it. There are honestly no games out there that I can say I've completed and not 5 minutes later, started all over again just for fun. The replay value is grand with 100 collectible treasures cleverly scattered throughout the game. Trophies with matching in-game medals that will net you money to spend on their little storefront where you can buy behind the scenes movies, and various items that you can use and apply to a very robust multiplayer if Modern Warfare 2 isn't your thing. <br /><br />All in all Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is thee must buy for any Playstation 3 owner. Sure, you can rent it, just be warned that by the time you finish it, or maybe even start it, you're going to be wishing you didn't have to send it back and that it was all yours to play whenever you want. This is what gaming is all about. This is why I have a passion for my hobby. And it is the reason why I love my PS3 again.<br /><br />On my rating scale, I give this experience a stunning:<br />5 Water Bottles Full of Pee, out of 5.... (that scale should be self explanatory)<br />

UNFREAKINBELIEVABLE! NAUGHTY DOG'S MASTERPIECE!
First, before you read this review go buy a copy of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves NOW! This is the most spectacular, mind blowing, jaw-dropping game I've ever played and I've been playing them since the days of Atari. I'm about three-quarters of the way through the game and I'm still seeing amazing gameplay aspects that makes my jaw drop and ask how in the world did they do that. I really don't know how they got the graphics to look this awesome but they did. The lighting, water effects, character details, weapon details are all the best I've seen in a game. The way light shines off stuff will make you go cross-eyed from staring too long.<br /><br />The voice acting of not just Nate's character, but even the minor characters are top-notch. We're talking Hollywood A-list acting! The comedic lines are put in just the right places at the right times. The gun fire and explosions will immerse you in the game like it's been never done before. The story was fantastically written, as well. This is almost literally like playing a summer Hollywood blockbuster movie! There's so much action going at a frenetic pace that you'll sometimes feel overwhelmed. But that's a very good thing in this case because the use of weapons is a seamless and flawless experience. As easy as the weapons were to use in the first Uncharted they seem even more improved this time around. There are many climatic scenes and climax you will! The train scene will leave you gasping in amazement!!!<br /><br />From what I've read, this Uncharted is at least several hours longer that the first one. Awesome! That seems true seeing as though I'm 75% through Uncharted 2 and the time I've invested in it so far is about the same as what it took me to beat the first one. There's so much goodness to be had in story mode that it's ridiculous. To top it all off, we also get a co-op mode and a multiplayer mode that should add countless hours of fun to the mix. Both of which I've yet to play. There's so much to do you'll be playing this one until the end of the year. Is this going to be Game Of The Year? Well, I think it will come down to this or Call Of Duty 5. My money's on Uncharted 2 winning it. If Uncharted 2 were a painting it would hung in The Louvre because it's a masterpiece<br /><br />This is the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. A game has never blown me away quite like this one. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 score or 5 stars out of 5... this is one of those games that only comes along once in a great while and one of those that if you could you'd give it an 11 out of 10 score because it's that freakin' amazing. Highly recommended without hesitation. If you don't like this game you're either nuts or don't like video games! Naughty Dog I praise you immensely for you have mesmerized me and spellbound me beyond belief... if you have only one game you can get this year this be it!

As closer to perfection as it gets: this game is a masterpiece
This is one of those games that will keep you glued to your TV for hours until you manage to beat it or your bladder explodes, whatever happens first.<br /><br />Right from the start it will submerge you into its world of friendship, adventure, action, betrayal, mystery, and love. The heroes are so likable that you wish they were real so you could go have a beer with them.<br /><br />But the story is not the only thing that shines, the graphics are just breath-taking and the controls are very responsive. This time around I enjoyed the stealth sections.<br /><br />And I'm only talking about the single-player campaign. I was afraid multiplayer would be an after-thought, yet the Dogs managed to create a very solid and entertaining experience, not to mention addictive.<br /><br />But enough blah blah blah, if you like great games get off your chair right now and go buy it!... You're welcome :)

Drake is Back....
Well it's been a couple of years since Nathan Drake first visit the Playstation 3 and now he's back for his second adventure.  So how's it fare compared to his first adventure?  Quite amazing in my opinion.  I have been reading the publication reviews and seen the critical acclaim for this game.  Now I was a little skeptical it would be much better than the original since I believe that game was largely overlooked.  This game really puts everything together that makes the Uncharted series one of the best in gaming.  I want to give those who may be on the fence or have no idea about Uncharted 2 a little taste of what makes this game so great.<br /><br />First off we have our hero and cover star Nathan Drake.  What makes Nathan so great is that many people can relate to his unassuming ways.  Although by some of the things he does he is an action star he still comes off as an ordinary guy.  Back to the series is Nathan's long time friend Sully and also his slight romantic interest Elena.  We also get new characters that are questionable friends of Nathan.  To say the least the dialogue is what sets this game apart.  From the first minute you get into this game you will begin to think you are watching a blockbuster movie.  Although you are now the star.  <br /><br />In the first game Nathan was in search of the riches of his ancestor Sir Frances Drake.  Now on his second adventure he is on a quest to find the lost treasures that Marco Polo was in search of.  The game reminds me of National Treasure combined with Indiana Jones.  Although I would tend to think that some of the acting and battle scenes are actually better in this game.  What I love about Uncharted 2 is the blend of cut scenes and action.  Nothing in this game gets overly tedious.  There are no long cut scenes and the action is intense but not overly done.  Then to top it off you get some wonderful puzzles that keep you thinking.  <br /><br />The quest will take you from a lush rainforest to a war torn Nepal and then up into the Himalayas.  To say the least the environments are awe inspiring.  The original game brought the PS3 graphics that hadn't been seen and now this game only improves the formula.  Nothing is more beautiful than being up on top of a building in Nepal and viewing the Himalayas.  Forget the vacation.  The environments will put you there.  <br /><br />As far as the gameplay is concerned they have only improved what was already great.  The cover system is excellent.  Although sometimes it's a little tiring when your character stays in the cover position during a battle.  The battle scenes are a lot of fun and can be challenging at times.  The game is not about just plowing down all the enemies.  Sometimes you have a dozen enemies firing at you from all different angles.  That is where you need to use strategy.  Even on normal play level you will probably find yourself dying during some intense battles.  Although for those of you who enjoy punishment they have a hard setting and even hardcore.  I do believe most of you will play this game more than once.<br /><br />Uncharted 2 is what sets the PS3 apart.  This is the game that sets the bar.  Naughty Dog has really outdone themselves with an amazing adventure that should have every gamer giving it a try.  There has not been one game that I would have said you must buy a PS3 for.  That is until Uncharted 2.  This game is by far one of the best adventure games not only this generation but ever.  I would easily rate this as one of the five best games I have ever played.  Also if you have not played the original Uncharted you owe it to yourself to play that game also.  They are two of the best PS3 games available.

More than a game, this is an experience
I rarely have time these days to play games, which has more to do with a demanding job than any personal feelings I've had of late concerning the lackluster offerings for my Xbox 360. But this Christmas season (2009) brought a change to my previously lack luster gaming enthusiasm when our bedroom TV died and we replaced it with a new HD set. Accompanying the new TV was a PS3, which was originally slated to be a media center and Blu-ray player - remember I already have an Xbox 360. However, during Christmas my wife bought Uncharted 2 for me after a friend told her about the game. I'm sad to say that this game was left unopened for most of the Christmas holiday until a few days ago, when the family went to bed early and I was too worn out to work. <br /><br />What followed that night was an experience I never thought possible from a video game... <br /><br />Imagine, a movie. Not just any movie, and certainly not a film from modern-day Hollywood, with its ridiculous FX budget and lackluster story, plot and characters so thin you can swear when they move just right they're damn near transparent. No. Instead reach back to the days when movie making was about story telling. Imagine a historical treasure hunt encompassing the best elements from movies like Casablanca, Raiders, Lawrence of Arabia and even the recent Cage film National Treasure. Now picture yourself being an active participate in such a film, and you can only just begin to understand the sheer thrill this game brings to the PS3.<br /><br />Gameplay - and you might have to forgive me, as again I'm not an experienced gamer - is fantastic. The way the developers at Naughty Dog have literally blended the gameplay with small transitional cut scenes and longer cinematic ones moves the game along at such a pace that putting down the controller, for even a few minutes takes a rather strong will (or a really weak bladder). The end result is a game that keeps you on pins and needles through the story's twists and turns and quite literal cliff hangers. The voice acting is actually superior than a lot of animated work coming out of Hollywood these days and the animated characters themselves display such a wide range of emotions and expressions that you nearly forget you're watching a computer generated scene. The actual character development is terrific, and as someone who didn't play the first Uncharted release I found the reveals of Drake's past handled perfectly as the introduction of a previous character (no spoilers here) didn't feel forced or odd. As the story develops (at first with a Pulp Fiction flashback-esque flair) and Drake's adventure unfolds the seamless story+gameplay+character development makes you feel as though you are participating in a cinematic masterpiece instead of playing a video game.<br /><br />That night when I finally opened Uncharted 2 was the first time in nearly 10 years I spent more than a simple hour moving my thumbs over the buttons of a console controller. That night, for those brief eight hours I wasn't simply playing a game, I was experiencing an adventure.<br /><br />Buy this game, and if you just own an XBox 360 - like I did, go out and buy the $299 PS3 and Uncharted 2. It's that good; you won't be disappointed.

Uncharted 2 the Masterpiece.
When it comes to gaming, there are games that can be horrible, mediocre, good or even great, but then there are the true classics that rarely comes along and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of them. The first Uncharted had set a very good bar to overcome and the sequel definitely surpasses it with leaps and bounds. Let me first say that whoever thinks this game is over-hyped or over-rated are clearly 1. XBox 360 Fanboys, and 2. Gamers with no clue on what a classic is. The evidence is there: 25 Perfect Gaming Magazine Editorial Scores, over 30 Game of the Year Awards, and has a Top 10 Ranking All-Time on [...]. Now with the haters out of the way Uncharted 2: Among Thieves brings Nathan Drake back for a second epic adventure. This is a 3rd Person Action-Adventure/Platformer filled with gunfights, beautiful cutscenes, and a fantastic story. For a brief explanation of the story, without giving much away, Nathan Drake goes on a journey to discover the truth of Marco Polo's lost fleet and Shambhala's legendary Himalayan valley. In my review I'll cover and rate the game on Presentation, Graphics, Sound, Gameplay, and Replayability.<br /><br />Presentation 10/10: Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has a fantastic story. Its deeply filled with plot twist, deception, action, and suspense. The cutscenes are all spectacular and will leave you in awe. <br /><br />Graphics 10/10: This is thee best game out now in terms of graphics. You will be stunned by the beauty of its design, the characters and levels are all in superb detail. If you want a game that takes full advantage of your PS3 look no further. <br /><br />Sound 10/10: The voice acting is amazing. The weapon effects and explosions are all done with great detail and the game's soundtrack is one of the best ever.<br /><br />Gameplay 10/10: This game is action-packed. The gunplay is incredible, the new stealth system works very well, and the puzzles are actually fun. Lastly the online multiplayer/Co-op is spectacular.<br /><br />Replayability 10/10: The single player campaign can take you 10-15 hours easily. The story and gameplay are both so great multiple playthroughs are highly likely. Then the online itself will make you addicted with experience points and a level system from 1-60. <br /><br />My Overall Experience: This game is a classic hands down. Is this game worth your $60? Yes. It has the perfect combination of visuals, gameplay, and replayability not many other games have. This is a must have for all PS3 owners.

A Monumental Achievement for the PS3
Pros:<br /><br />+Absolutely gorgeous game<br />+Strong voice acting and production values<br />+Lots of gameplay<br />+Well Presented Story<br />+Likable characters<br />+Very well written script<br />+Excellent Multiplayer<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-A Couple of Trial and Error Moments.  There are just moments in the game where it's too easy to die because you just don't know what to do<br /><br />This review is pretty lengthy...<br /><br />In 2007, just a year after the release of the Playstation 3, a little game called Uncharted: Drake's Fortune dropped down.  It was by far one of the best games on the PS3.  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a masterpiece.  Unfortunately the adventure wasn't very long.  Uncharted 2 is much better than the game which precedes it by keeping intact what worked, but keeping the action coming swiftly and even improving on areas the first game didn't do so well in.<br /><br />Uncharted 2 begins in the midst of the action.  Nathan Drake returns and the moment Uncharted 2 starts off he's already in a heap of trouble.  He's been unconscious, and when he comes too he realizes that not only is he covered in a lot of blood, but that he's also on a train car that's perched on the edge of a mountain.  He just barely escapes before the train goes teetering over.  But how did he get there, exactly?  And what's going on?  This is what you're about to find out.  The game begins with you on the train but you'll quickly play through everything which lead him to his current situation.  Throughout the story you'll find yourself meeting a lot of interesting characters.  There's Harry Flynn and an old flame of Nate's named Chloe Frazer.  Together these three are interested in the secrets of Marco Polo's missing fleet.  But their only lead is an old oil lamp that supposedly holds the secrets.  So Nate, Flynn and Chloe opt to break into a museum and claim it for themselves.  Of course, it isn't that simple, and someone else is also after the treasure.  His name is Lazarevic--a war criminal that can be really nasty.<br /><br />I guess we might as well get this out of the way.  Uncharted 2 is absolutely gorgeous looking.  It is by far the prettiest game I've ever seen.  The environments are absorbing and incredible to behold.  Not only is the scenery breathtaking but the actions of the characters are fluid and all of the little details really stand out.  There are few games where I stop and just marvel at how extraordinary they look, but Uncharted 2 is one of them.  The first game was expertly designed as it is, but the second manages to outdo it.  It's one of the few games on the console that showcases just what the PS3 can really do.  The game knows it looks good and directs your attention to all the details.  Despite it being stunning visually, you won't find yourself getting lost much.  There's plenty to explore, but for the most part, Uncharted 2 is rather linear.  There's always a set path ahead of you and rarely anything off the beaten path.  That might be a downer for some, but the adventure in and of itself is still worth it.<br /><br />Looking good doesn't matter if the gameplay isn't great to back it up, however.  Uncharted 2 plays very similarly to the first one, and that's not so bad.  You'll pick up guns and get into gun fights, of course.  And some of them are pretty challenging.  The game utilizes a cover system where you'll duck behind cover, pop up and shoot.  You don't have to do this, but the game has its way of urging.  You can only take so much damage before you die.  Hiding behind objects is important.  Some of it will be destroyed easily, but most of what you hide behind makes for good cover.  If you don't want to shoot most of your enemies you can perform melee combos.  This works much more smoothly and fluently in Uncharted 2 than it does in the first one.  It's much more fluid and precise, though melee combat can still feel like button mashing at times, but at least it isn't useless.  There's also an emphasis on stealth in some areas, and thus stealth kills are also a lot easier to pull off.  Certain aspects have also been improved.  In the first game, for example, throwing grenades used the tilting controls which felt gimmicky.  Throwing grenades is much easier.  When walking across certain ledges you also won't have to do a balancing act using the controller either.  This makes using grenades in the middle of combat much more useful than before.  Though if you adjusted to the first one really well, you can enable those motion controls for grenades.<br /><br />Another aspect that Uncharted is big on is some of it's platforming elements.  As Nate, you'll be hanging from ledges and scaling walls and the like.  You'll also be jumping from certain platforms to the next.  This isn't as dangerous as you might think.  For the most part you'd have to really try to miss a jump.  The game doesn't guide you per se, it's just to say that timing isn't the most important thing.  In fact, in most cases missing a jump comes from jumping too soon rather than too late... or neglecting to take in your surroundings.  But it's pretty simple to get the hang of.  <br /><br />There are also puzzle elements to the game.  Most of the puzzles aren't really challenging in the slightest, but you might find your wits tested.  If you ever actually do get stuck on a puzzle or can't seem to figure out where to go, the game has a built in hint system to help your.  The game is willing to point you in the right direction when it needs to but it won't always hold your hand.  For example it might tell you what you need to do but not necessarily how to do it.  A hint will only present itself if you seem really stuck, and if you want you can turn the option off altogether. <br /><br />The pacing of the game is much better than the first.  The action and adventure hardly slows down, but most of all the twists and turns in the story don't feel so awkward.  There's a neat balance of gunplay, puzzle solving and transitioning from one part of the game to another.  The story also isn't bogged down in too many cutscenes, but they do their job.  You CAN skip the cutscenes, though, which is a big plus.  On the other hand, you might not want to.  The cutscenes are some of Uncharted 2's strong points.<br /><br />Presentation in your story is everything and Uncharted 2 does this well.  The script is very well written with some crafty dialog.  Some of which will make you laugh.  Even during moments of gameplay Nate and whoever he's with might start up a conversation, throwing a couple of jokes out there that you might laugh at.  Uncharted 2 isn't a comedic genius of a game, but it hardly tries to be more clever than it actually is.  And through these moments you get to learn about the characters and those you're meeting along the way.  As with the rest of game, the cutscenes are gorgeous and fluent.  The voice acting is among some of the best you'll hear in the video game industry.  And not just that, but the music is also spot on and sets the tone rather nicely.  <br /><br />Uncharted 2 has multiplayer.  You can play a standard deathmatch, a team deathmatch, matches where you'll claim territory and capture the flag.  All this is worthwhile because the multiplayer is just so damn addictive.  You don't have to be a pro to get up and go on it either.  All you need is knowledge of the game.  It's amazing just how fun the multiplayer can really be.  There's also a bit of co-op multiplayer where you can play through missions with two other allies and a horde mode as well.  For such a simple game, the multiplayer gives you a lot of things to do, and it's refreshingly addictive.<br /><br />There's not much which really holds Uncharted 2 down.  One thing that might start to grate on some nerves might be that some of the gunfights can be hectic, but the other big part of that just might get on some nerves is that there are certain parts throughout the game that can feel like trial and error at times.  You might have to die before you realize what it is you're actually supposed to do.  Most times upon finding out you might slap yourself and think it's so obvious.  Some of these moments will come from being impatient, others will come because the game throws you into the action immediately after a cutscene where the goal may not actually be to kill what's there but actually to run or something like that.  You just might die in Uncharted 2 several times because at some moments you just don't know what to do.  It's hardly frustrating, but it does mean you might find yourself dying or failing certain parts of the game needlessly.  <br /><br />On the other hand, it's nice as to just what Uncharted 2 does add to the experience.  Most of it is more action.  The first game was very much just you running from one gun fight to the next.  Uncharted 2 throws in some interesting bits such as a moment where you have to help an injured ally escape a tough situation while you're constantly being targeted.  Other moments include breaking into a museum and sneaking by the guards without getting caught and much more.  There's just a lot more variety to the gameplay than what you got in the first game.  As a result some moments of Uncharted 2 are just all out thrilling.  There's still the idea of progressing from one gun fight to the next, but it's nice to know there are other things being thrown at you this time around.<br /><br />Uncharted 2 is impressive.  It is easily one of the best games on the PS3.  Those who enjoyed the first one just might like Uncharted 2 better because it improves upon its prequel in various ways and ups the ante.  If you enjoyed Nathan Drake's first adventure... there's not reason not to give his second a try.

The only word to describe this game is: GREAT
The single player story mode is superb. It combines a lot of different aspects ranging from an all out shooter to platforming and even some stealth. The story is well written and the cutscenes are superbly done. The graphics are top notch, the best of any game and any system so far. The multiplayer is also very fun. It comes in two different modes: standard multiplayer and co-op. The stardard multi comes in your everyday modes of eliminiation, deathmatch and pretty much every mode of standard multi that has ever been invented. The co-op comes in two forms, either a story line mode or survival mode. The story line mode allows you to play a similar scene from the single player game but with 2 other people. The scenes look almost the same as the single player game but are different in their own way. The survival mode is just as the name implies but there is also another variation of it where you have to carry a treasure chest all the way back to your base in order to succeed. Basically the multiplayer modes are a compilation of the best modes from all other games. I highly recommend this game to anybody that owns a ps3 and the best part is that there is no installing the game or loading during the single player.

Drake is Back and In Full Effect
This review is not subsequent to "getting on the bandwagon" with other reviewers...but it wouldn't hurt.<br /><br />Instantly, you are immersed into edge-of-the-seat death-defying action!  Uncharted 2 catches you off guard on a regular basis, leaving little to no room for letting your guard down.<br /><br />The graphics are plush with great contrast ratio bringing out each color and making it easier to identify objects.<br /><br />Gameply acrobatics are unothidox (a good thing) as you hurlde over rooftop beams (don't slip), leap across large gaps that would lead to your untimely death should you fail the jump and creative interactive gaming sequences (ie. defusing alarm systems).<br /><br />This game is unlike any other game because it MAKES you utilize your surroundings (also a good thing).  Causing you to climb poles, leap across ledges while hanging off them, shimmy, and navigate rooftops & high areas.<br /><br />The story line is somewhat typical, with the proverbial double-cross, but it adds to the drama and is still great and you won't regret the purchase if you are into this type of genre.<br /><br />

Uncharted 2 is Among the Best
The long awaited and eagerly anticipated sequel to the most exciting cinematic game experience I've had since the original 'Uncharted: Drake's Fortune' and 'Metal Gear Solid 4' is finally here. <br /><br />Drenched with colorful, lush, and bright graphic and environment with some intensely dark atmosphere, this is the liveliest and most awe-inspiringly beautiful game this year and it's the feat few games have ever come close to in the history of video game.  Graphics definitely improved slightly from already top-notch original.  Animation is fluid, natural, and life-like, captured by now-common Hollywood filmmaking motion-capture technology to create CGI. In fact, everything in this game is superbly on par with the best of top-notch Hollywood summer blockbuster. This game is better than anything I've seen during this year's (2009) dreadful summer movie line-ups. Griping pulpy action-adventure storyline in remeniscent of 'Indiana Jones' series, exciting orchestra and atmospheric scores using lots of drums and flutes, intense 3rd-person action, platform and puzzle gameplay mechanics and seamlessly integrated cutscenes peppered with many filmmaking techniques and signature camera movements are nothing short of brilliant. It borrows the best elements from various games and movies, thoroughly digests, and in turn creates something so familiar yet different.  U2 oozes with quality in every second it's on your screen.<br /><br />Despite the wave after wave of baddies with assortments of guns and more guns, this is not a mindless 3rd-person shooter. The importance of using cover is imperative. Without cover, stealth and acrobatic moves, you are likely to get killed within few seconds. Yet the satisfaction of pumping bullets into baddies is immensely gratifying. Newly implemented stealth attack is a nice addition to the original. Jumping from one ledge to anothor is exciting and platforming is all about how to get to the next area. Puzzle-solving is less complex but adequate enough for the game's main attraction is story and action. There are also a few stages where you are shooting for your life on moving stages.<br /><br />Acting is superb and real actors in motion-sensor suit were casted for acting and voice. One of few game that can really claim that the acting is top-notch along with superb voice-acting.  The score and the sound effects are incredible.  Hearing the main theme for the second time is a pure joy and an instant reminder that U2 is a sequel to an outstanding and highly successful blockbuster.<br /><br />U2 is a prime example where linearity, if well-structured, gives you more intense sense of urgency and excitement, something open-ended, free-forming games often lack. Furthermore, without the loading time, it actually feels as if it were, free-roaming game. Cutscenes are used by in-game graphics and they are blended seamlessly together. This is the closest thing to 'Interactive Movie' alongside the renowned MGS series. Throughout the game, the feeling of you being involved and immersed into the very game you play as if you were the main protagonist is constantly and continuously maintained.<br /><br />Naughty Dogs added co-op and up to 10 competitive multiplayer this time and main campaign spans 26 chapters in 12 to 15 hours single player campaign plus unlockable contents, hidden treasure hunts and trophies collection.<br /><br />Combat and movement is slightly more refined than the first one and stages are more diverse.  There are more contents and the game is also slightly longer than the first one.  The only downside, as a fan of action-adventure game, is just as the first game was, that the puzzle elements are too far and between and platforming still feels little too automated.  But Platforming is exciting nontheless and figuring out how to get to the next is puzzle itself, so as I said before, the main focus here is story and action and the pacing is incredible to make you forget the minor complains.  Everything on screen is pure joy to your eyes and graphical attention to detail like no other game currently in the market.<br /><br />Exciting action adventure game with awesome combat in breakneck-pace, quality script and great presentation, Uncharted 2 ventures further into where many games have gone before but few games succeed and places itself among the very best of video game.  Get it now.

Arguably the best game on ps3
There's pretty much one thing that comes to mind when I think of this game. If you have a PS3 but you don't have Uncharted 2....you're doing it wrong. This is one of the greatest PS3 games to come out ever and well its a reason to own a PS3. the graphics are the best on a console in a while. Even if you didn't enjoy the first one or play it don't worry this game is 10 times better than the first one and even though it doesn't do much different it just does everything right and better than anyone. Its as simple as that. If you have the chance to get this game and/or a ps3 take it and you will be pleased. But the decision is yours I'm only trying to help.

"Why do I always get myself into these things?"
Uncharted 2 really is a marvel - not only does it improve upon the original game in nearly every way, it establishes its own identity right from the start, and holds it throughout the adventure.<br /><br />By now, everyone knows about the positives of the experience. First off, the graphics are amazing. Every area is distinct and has its own sense of history, and once you get up to the higher buildings and plateaus, you'll be wowed by the draw distance (you can look way out towards mountains and far off buildings, and everything out there is rendered, not just some flat surface). The temples in particular are just gorgeous, with multiple light sources and highly detailed statues and idols. As with the first game, water looks fantastic, whether in pools or rapids, and fire is just as convincing. Nate and his companions look great and are animated with more fluidity this time around, and there seem to be more enemy types than in the first game (you can tell which ones are tougher just by looking at their armor and/or face paint).<br /><br />The first game got a little monotonous towards the end, as the last few chapters fell back on long gunfights against waves of bad guys. Uncharted 2 has a lot more variety in terms of gameplay, including some of the most memorable sequences of this gaming generation. In one of my favorites, you start off on the back of a train and have to run/climb to the front, all while battling enemies and trying to avoid fire from a helicopter (and you'll notice that the environment actually changes around you - no repetitive backgrounds here!). Even the seemingly mundane tasks are fun, as the platforming isn't as tedious and puzzles aren't as obvious (though they're are still spelled out for you in the journal). Gunfights are always entertaining and require some strategy (enemies will flank you and throw grenades/launch rockets/snipe you from afar). There is a greater variety of weapons, and combined with the possibility of stealth kills, it allows for multiple strategies.<br /><br />I haven't mentioned the story yet, but it's very good as well. I didn't really dig Nate's new friends (it's pretty obvious they're setting him up), but thankfully you meet up with an old one before too long. Nate and his friends spout tons of fun dialogue and lighten the air in otherwise tense situations. The plot is much like an Indiana Jones movie, with a brutal commander seeking out a mystical orb, and several parts were definitely inspired by the Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid games. There is a surprise revelation at the end again, and it fits what was set up pretty well. It's also followed up by an end boss fight that's actually worthy of the rest of the game, and exciting in its own right. I did feel that the fate of one person at the end could have taken a different path, as things are wrapped up a little too neatly.<br /><br />Now for the negatives. First off, the controls can be a pain, even towards the end of the game. Don't get me wrong, they're much improved from the first game (where I always had issues moving the camera, especially when transitioning from platforming to aiming). For one thing, grenades no longer require an arc, you just aim as with your gun and press L2 to toss one to that spot. But there are issues...<br /><br />As with the first Uncharted, I found the cover system annoying at times, as I'd keep jumping out of cover when really I wanted to run behind the next box or pillar. I also found myself getting "unstuck" from cover when I didn't want to be (Nate will often stand up from cover when walking behind a fence or wall). It doesn't help that the same button is used for rolling. If they had used the same system as in MGS4 (where you would remain in cover until you pressed circle again) it would have been more clear which position you were in. Platforming is more intuitive than the first game, but it's not always clear which pieces of the background can be climbed or jumped onto and which can't. Also, it's a minor thing, but over the course of the game, you'll repeat the same actions a few times, like rappelling down a line to a lower area, having to give someone a boost to reach a ladder, or pushing a cart out of the way.<br /><br />A few times in the game, I got stuck in a room or other area and didn't know what to do next. For instance, at one point you're on the roof of a tall building and there is no obvious way to get down. You're supposed to follow one of your companions to show you the way, but if you're not fast enough, she will be gone and you'll be left running around for half an hour, wondering how she disappeared. As I mentioned above, I would try jumping onto certain things and wouldn't be able to. Most of the time the game gives hints on how to proceed, but this isn't always the case.<br /><br />Occasionally there will be a graphical hiccup, as a texture would pop in after a second or two or Nate would clip through an object or the floor. These are small things and easily overlooked in light of the otherwise fantastic visuals. My PS3 Slim locked up towards the end of the game, but played the rest just fine (I think it was right before a cutscene). That was the only major problem in almost 13 hours of play.<br /><br />One other thing that's worth mentioning: There are no female enemies in the game. The only (two) women in the game are Nate's friends. One is the dark, mysterious type, the other a plucky "sunshine" girl. You play alongside the women at times, but never get to play AS them (which would have been a nice change of pace). I guess having them fight with you is enough for now though, as the AI is well done and they will take out some of the enemies for you.<br /><br />By the way, Sully is only in a small portion of the game, which is disappointing.<br /><br />These few problems do little to mar the overall experience. Uncharted 2 is lots of fun to play and has plenty of memorable moments, and remains one of the best games on the PS3.

Best video game I've played
I'm a movie buff and not much of a gamer.  I have a ton of movies on blu-ray and a handful of PS3 games.  Reviews for this game were quite strong so I purchased this game on Amazon "blind".  <br /><br />So here are my observations from the perspective of a movie fan and a casual gamer:<br /><br />1.  This game is first and foremost FUN!  It actually has vibrant color, in contrast to the desaturated look of many action video games (even movies).  It doesn't take itself too seriously; it has a good story that's told well.  I was reminded of the first time I watched "Raiders of the Lost Ark".  For sheer entertainment value, I think it's hard to beat this game, even at the current full retail price.  My wife was watching me play and for the first time ever (with a video game), watched as a spectator and enjoyed it.  This game has changed her view on what the video game entertainment experience can be.<br /><br />2. This game knows what it's doing and it shows.  It takes a confident game to stop the action for a few minutes and just show Drake walking through a village; that particular sequence is absolutely gorgeous (and it's not even a cut scene).  There's no action; you're just experiencing the village, the people, the language, the color.  Amazing.  <br /><br />3.  This game is stellar from a technical point of view.  Superb graphics, great cinematic sound, convincing (for a video game) voice acting, movements, and facial gestures.<br /><br />4.  This game should raise the bar for others in the future.  As things stand now, I don't know if I'll be able to enjoy other games in quite the same way; my expectations now are probably way too high.  Even action movies from now on will probably seem like a passive experience.<br /><br />5. This game is a great value.  I've only played the single player mode; even then it's probably the best $50 that I've ever spent on an entertainment item.<br /><br />I can only hope we get more games such as this one in the future!

I'm not good on posting reviews but this game rocks
Its hard for me to write a review since my native language is spanish but all I can say about this game is that it's excellent.  Graphics are amazing, campaing awesome and online playing is great too.  This is what the ps3 needed, now I'm ager to see God Of War 3 and Gran Turismo 5, they are the aces sony needed on the console wars to beat xbox once and forever.

Uncharted 2 arguably offers the most PS3 fun this holiday season
From the treks through steamy jungles to the endless wisecracks, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has a lot in common with its 2007 predecessor. You're still controlling the rugged everyman Nathan Drake in an Indiana Jones-inspired adventure, and he hasn't learned many moves since his first outing. But while the sequel may sound by-the-books on paper, the actual results are astonishing. While the original was competent and easy on the eyes, Uncharted 2 is a game that should sell consoles. I cannot believe how well the final project came together.<br /><br />Uncharted 2 wastes no time throwing you into the action, as Nathan awakens in a wrecked train dangling from the Himalayan cliff. After a harrowing climb back onto the snowy ground, the game flashes back to a tropical beach. Here, he and new "friends" Chloe and Flynn discuss how to steal a lamp that may hold Marco Polo's secret directions to Shangri La. From this initial meeting, you'll be struck by how well-written and delivered the dialogue is. Not that the first game was a dramatic slouch, but because you're more familiar with Nathan and company, their actions have much more resonance.<br /><br />After the beach rendezvous, Uncharted 2 whisks you away to Nepal, where you'll explore temples, a mountain village, a militarized city and a heavily armed train. The level variety puts the original to shame, as if Naughty Dog was trying to address a complaint nobody even had in the first place. And more impressive, every inch of the additional real estate is populated with tons of furniture, fauna and other assorted knickknacks. Though it's hard to stop to look at the rooftops when a missile-launching helicopter is pursuing you, a quick glance at the Nepali skyline will astound with its level of detail.<br /><br />The presentation has received the biggest boost, but there have been subtle improvements to the combat as well. Melee combos are much more forgiving, so that you can mostly get away with mashing the punch button instead of needing split-second timing. Enemies also absorb fewer bullets than before and are now susceptible to stealthy attacks from behind. The sneakier options and smoother controls mean that combat zones suddenly become Nathan's playgrounds, letting you pick and choose how you want to dispose of your enemies.<br />Unfortunately, while Nathan's fighting skills have improved, I do wish there were more footholds when it's time to climb. To go from a sprawling arena to a single, linear path can be frustrating, especially when this path is obscured by plants and debris. The game always gives you hints if you're stuck, but I think giving the player a few more entry points would have been the way to go.<br /><br />The main adventure's 20-plus chapter journey is riveting. It delivers all of the thrills that we had hoped from Indiana Jones last summer, and Nathan's band of sidekicks exudes warmth that other story-driven games lack. But if video game storytelling isn't your thing, the new multiplayer options may hold your attention for a little while. You have standard death match and capture the flag variants, but the real treat is co-op, where up to three players can team up to score some treasure. I don't think the gunplay is going to lure anyone away from holiday biggies like Halo 3: ODST and Modern Warfare 2, but there's some to be had for casual shooter fans.<br /><br />Even if you never go online, Uncharted 2 arguably offers the most PS3 fun this holiday season. The set pieces are exhilarating, the scenery is gorgeous and the characters play off of each other beautifully. Like Marco Polo in his quest for Shangri La, the industry will release an impressive fleet of games this fall, and only a handful will survive on the shelves. Make sure that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of them.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway

Instant Classic!!!
I really didn't think that anything would top the graphics from MGS4...but this spanks it! Love the gameplay, story, and of course the graphics (not to mention the online play). The replay value is also incredible and that excludes the online play. I have always been one of those gamers that prefers a game with a awesome single player campaign more than online play and for if your like me, you will love this game. Game of the year in my book, but Modern Warfare 2 will get it because for the last couple years its been more about sales than anything. For instance when GTA4 beat out MGS4 by almost all award shows/websites I was truly sickened...<br /><br />PS: GTA is the most overrated garbage ever.

An interactive movie experience
It's already been said a thousand times, I'm just adding my opinion to counter the one idiot who felt compelled to give this 1 star.  It is like playing the lead in one of the greatest action-adventure movies ever.  You'd be hard pressed to find any video game fan that wouldn't enjoy this experience.  I'm terrible at the multiplayer but it looks fun if that's what you're in to.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!

Fantastic piece of gaming, should be 2009's game of the year.
This game officially sets the bar for "next gen" releases for years to come.  I am blown away with the amount of detail, depth, action, dedication etc that was put into this game.  I cannot stop promoting this game to friends who also play video games.  Reading all sorts of reviews is one of my main habits when purchasing any item.  This is my first review ever on Amazon, and this game is the main reason why I must start now.  I own the XBOX360, PS3 and Nintendo Wii.  And this game is just THAT AMAZING. Period.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Ridiculous amount of detail put into this piece of work.<br />-Voice acting and character movement is top notch, I have never played/seen a game match this yet.<br />-RECORDED/SAVED GAMES FOR MULTIPLAYER.  I feel like most reviews have not covered this great feature that should be in all multiplayer games.  I love going back to multiplayer games to see what I might have missed out on.<br />-Unlockables! I love this feature, I feel like I'm back on Goldeneye 007 for Nintendo 64, chuckling at Donkey Kong head mode. Now I'm chuckling like a little kid at Doughnut Drake!<br />Freakin awesome<br />-Very minimal amount of bugs/glitches.  I can't say I've come across many, if any, games that are this level of quality.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-This game must have the record for people being saved with one hand from falling off cliffs, broken bridges, buildings etc.<br />-Sure nothing is perfect, but I got stuck in a big sprocket wheel thing.  That was probably the biggest glitch I ran into.  This is not a full on CON because it didn't take away from my near perfect experience with this game.  I've also had an enemy move super fast blurry-like crouching from side to side, like an agent in the Matrix. Again, this did not take away from my experience, I actually laughed at it in amusement.<br />-Doughnut Drake rests his arms in his stomach. His rifle sticks out at his upper back fat and lower back fat.  My favorite skin so far is a little off, but I still love it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I really only have two negative things to say about this game.  Naughty Dog, the game's developer, deserves a standing ovation for their work on this masterpiece.  I'm itching to jump back into campaign on hard difficulty after just beating Uncharted 2 on normal difficult at 2AM last night.  I love Uncharted 2 and I don't see myself putting it down for a long time.  I started off playing multiplayer on the demo/beta until the first 3 days of owning the game.  So I'm also itching to jump back to that.<br /><br />If you own a PS3, buy Uncharted 2. It's simply a no brainer.  I'd be very surprised to see a PS3 owner without this game in their library.<br /><br />If you don't own a PS3, this is a perfectly good reason to go out and get one. Like NOW.

You will hear it a lot, but this game IS a Masterpiece.
From the very beginning of this game I was hooked - the beauty that NaughtyDog has constructed in every inch of this game is outstanding. This game will shape the way games are made and will set a new standard to titles that are priced at $60. The value is uncanny and it provides constant replay and multiplayer benefits. <br /><br />IF you own a PS3 and don't have this game - then why not!?

Love it!!!
After thoroughly enjoying the first Uncharted, Uncharted 2 was a must get for me.  The story, graphics, and gameplay are great.  I ended up playing it through four times (most games only get two play throughs).  It's loads of fun, and I'd highly recommend it.  Not much else to say that hasn't already been said.

BEST Multiplayer Experience on the PS3 so far.
The game itself is an amazing addition to the video game genre and one of the best I've ever played.  There are countless elements to discuss about this game which make it so great, but it's all been said by HUNDREDS of others, so I won't beat it to death.  To summarize, the graphics will blow you away and give one of the most immersive game experiences on the market.  Sound is movie quality.  Gameplay is tight and responsive, and you feel like you're treking every step with Drake.  Story is solid.  Single player alone is worth the buy...<br /><br />But that's not why I'm writing this review.  I'm here to talk about the multiplayer, which has me playing night after night.  First off, The menu's for the MP are well done and easy to navigate.  There are 2 MP modes, Co-op & Competitive. Co-op is a mode where 3 people take on CPUs to do campaign missions, survival mode, or treasure hunter type games.  Competitive MP is where 2 teams of 5 square off in an array of different scenarios:  Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Turf War, Chain Reaction, Elimination, or Plunder.  Deathmatch is self explanatory, but it breaks down even FURTHER when you have all weapons, RPGs only, pistol & grenades only, Sniper rifle & pistole only... it's all good.  King of the Hill, Turf War, & Chain Reaction all have you capturing zones to give your team pts, each mode varying in gameplay.  Elimination basically has you trying to kill all members of the opposing team before they do in a best of 5 rounds.  Plunder puts a good spin on capture the flag, with the ability to THROW the flag (treasure).  All in all, each MP mode offers something unique and a great way to play online, be it with friends or solo.  The party system works great and allows you to easily set up a group of people ready to play games together.  Did I almost forget that there's a leveling system and upgrades for Co-op and Competitive Mode?  Plenty of Skins for your character?  Taunting?  All can be purchased with money made from playing online and add depth to the experience.  Naughty Dog is keeping things fresh with updates and downloadable maps and skins.. in fact there's supposed to be a new Map Pack being released 4/22!  Buy it already!!  You won't be disappointed!

Flawless production
I'm not much of a gamer, I bought a PS3 largely to stream Netflix movies to my TV, play the occasional blu-ray, and maybe use it as a little media center. Until I picked up Uncharted 2, I'd been halfheartedly playing my way through GTA IV, and occasionally God of War. <br />This game was being demoed at Best Buy, and I happened to play it for about five minutes, where I was impressed with the graphics and gunplay mechanics, so I picked it up Friday after work.<br />It's now Sunday night, I just finished it, and I've been playing through the weekend nearly every waking minute. I've had to carve time out away from this game to do anything, it's completely amazing, engrossing, and entertaining. <br />The music is awesome and cinematic, the story is fun, the dialogue had me laughing out loud on occasion. The level design and visuals are breathtaking, every single environment is richly detailed, and I often found myself stopping gameplay just to look around the scenery, it's incredible. The graphics engine is so good, the cutscenes are rendered in real time, and they look like something out of Pixar. Gameplay is fluid and intuitive, the game on normal setting was challenging but never frustrating, and I never found a moment where I felt like I was putting in work to get to the next level. <br />This is as close as you're going to get to starring in your own Indiana Jones movie. Every element of the game was incredible, and although I'm sad the story is over, if the game took me any longer I'd be calling in sick to work to finish.

One of the Best Games to Come Around.
Uncharted 2 has everything going for it. A fun campaign mode, awesome multiplayer, amazing graphics & sound, etc. <br /><br />I usually prefer a nice single player campaign over a game's multiplayer, but this one has both. When I first put in UC2, I was blown away by the amazing cutscenes and gameplay. I hadn't played Drake's Fortune, so everything was new to me. The story still isn't FANTASTIC, but it still has your attention, and there is really no point in the game that will have you wanting more. <br /><br />The multiplayer adds so many more hours of gameplay. At first, I never thought about starting up the multiplayer mode, until I looked up some videos on YouTube. It looked so fun, and reminded me of Gears of War's multiplayer(3rd person, the cover system, everyone starts out with the same weapons and you have to find certain weapons in certain areas), but only better because of the interactions you have with the environment. I played for hours and didn't want to stop.<br /><br />Overall, UC2 was probably one of my favorite games of 09. Tons of replay value, and some of the best visuals I have ever seen.

The Most FUN I've had with my PS3... or any game
This is the first time I've reviewed a game i bought but it was just that good<br /><br />presentaion- 10/10 <br />Simply everything is spot, you can tell a lot of effort was put into this one. Tons of stuff Naughty Dog didn't need to do but did don't go unnoticed. Drake is back with all the action and humor you expect from the series and then some. The story is perfect for keeping the action rolling and making you feel like your in action movie.<br />graphics-    10/10<br />From the opening to the credits roll nothing is short of spectacular. The layers of animation, jaw-dropping environments, and realistic physics immerse the viewer perfectly. nuff said<br />sound-       10/10<br />an epic score, convincing voice acting and spot on sound effects are all present <br />gameplay-    9.5/10<br />For a third person shooter the controls are perfect and despite some minimal quirks jumping in and out of cover everything is solid. Also some nice variety with vertical and moving levels. Some reviews negatively mentioned a stealth section in the second chapter but I got through on my first try so if you have trouble just check out a guide. <br />lasting appeal- 10/10<br />I played through the campaign four times for normal, hard, crushing and all the treasures and it is rare nowadays to find a game with this fun a campaign. Online is surprisingly addicting and with medals a boosters to mix it up a little. More fun the cod or anything I've played online and has kept me hooked far longer than any other game<br /><br />overall 10/10 If your reading this review and have a ps3 buy this game you won't regret it

More Of What You've Been Hearing :)
Uncharted 2 is without a doubt, the best action adventure game i've ever played in my life!!! And im not just saying that because everyone else is, im saying that because its true. The graphics are the best i've EVER seen, and it's as addicting as the first part to play. I beat the game in two days after playing non stop!!!. It's a few hours longer than the first game, which is a good thing, though things did get a little random towards the end of the game...a little. Anyways, like the first, the whole game plays out like a movie, and it's actually gotten better with the sequences (train scene, jumping out of a falling building, etc), and the jokes in this game are actually funny! (Sully: I think we gotta follow those (water) hose. Nathan: You always follow the hose). lol. The shooting has gotten better, the targeting has gotten better, HELL!! EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!! If you don't own it, buy this game, you WILL not regret it!!!

PS3's killer app is here
Hideo Kojima has done it again. MGS4 is the most detailed, convincing, and well-researched game I have ever played. It offers a compelling and imaginative glimpse into the future of high-tech warfare, a nuanced, intelligent storyline, vastly improved gameplay, and incredible graphics.<br /> <br />The metal gear franchise has always pushed the boundaries of what a game could be, and challenged the preconceptions of the audience. MGS4 starts out with, of all things, a short live action film about marine fauna. The in-game store discounts weapons (in real time) on wednesdays and sundays. These are just a few examples, but there are many more. The story has both the philosophical and political musings as well as the bizarre humor and one of a kind characters that fans expect. <br /><br />The gameplay is more open and the action is more intense than in prior games. The environments seem much bigger and are bustling with npcs engaged in building to building warfare. Snake can join either side in the conflict or ignore them and sneak by. He has a ton of new weapons and gadgets as well. <br />The graphics are among the most impressive I have seen in a game. The characters are solid physical presences with subtle, lifelike facial expressions. The mechs move with an animal grace and hunt with a keen intelligence that belies their artificial construction. <br /><br />Overall, the game is an experience that should not be missed by anyone with a PS3. If you don't already own a PS3, this game alone would justify its purchase. It is by far the most creative, original, and technically polished game to appear on the system to date.

Wow! Just Amazing!
Before I start... I do my fair share of gaming, but I'am by no means a very obsessive gamer. So I never really knew about Metal Gear Solid until I bought this game. I'm a huge fan of first person shooter games like COD, Resistance, etc. So I saw the ads and thought it was another military type shooting game so I went out and spent the $59.99 and got the game. I put the game into the PS3 and after about an 8 minute wait (becasue the game is so amazing that it needs time to load some stuff on to the PS, but you still need the disk to play the game!) the game started and I was completely blown away. I have played some really good games in my time and on many systems, but this has, by far, been THE best game that I have palyed on ANY system before. The quick down low on this game... the graphics... I give a 10/10. The detailing of the all the characters, the details on the machinery and the surroundings, it was awesome. The thing that made is so spectacular was the fact that the developers did put so much attention to the details that they did a very good job of simulating real life as best as possible. Another big pet peeve of mine is the acting of the characters in the game. I feel like it plays a big part in the gaming experience and people don't give it much credit. So for the acting another 10/10: the character voices fit the characters, and the voice acting was done superbly. The animation was also done extremely well, my only fuss about the animation is that you can't really read how the character is feeling by looking at thier face: the pretty much always put on the same face... but no game has ever done that really well either so I looked over that fact. Finally for game play I give 9/10. I give it such a "low" rating because quite frankly this game is a bit tough to get accustomed to (all though once you do... you're pretty much ready to kick some MAJOR BUTT). I guess a more crazy gamer would have managed to get all the controls down quickly... but for me it took me a while to figure out how to use all the controls. At first the menu that shows all your items, weapons, and an array of other things was very difficult to figure out. Once you got past that you had to actaully figure out how to use the items, weapons, etc. It took me the longest time to figure out how to use Med-packs... but that could also be due to my inabilities :-p. So basically thats why the gameplay is 9/10... overall its just a confusing interface to get used to, but once you do it gets very fun. Also the interactions in the game is awesome. Like the bad guys can figure out when you are there just by bascially seeing you (obviously), hearing you (also obvious), and smelling you (Yea... thats a new one on me too). So its really fun trying to sneak around all the levels w/o getting spotted... but fear not my first person shooter fans... there are thrills here for you too... if the baddies spot you, you're gonna' be pulling out some very nifty guns to shoot them: my fav. is the p90. Just before I end here, if you don't know about the Metal Gear Series (like myself) you won't really know what's going on in the game. In that sense it really sucks because you're just shooting and sneaking around w/o really knowing what's happening. The developers just assumed that you played previous versions so they just build on the stories of the last one's so you miss out a lot of the stories and things like that. But, I went on Wiki and basically read the story like a book so I was all set! And lastly (I promise this time) the game does feel like its more of a movie with some player interaction becasue the cut scenes are ridiculously long... so if you are'nt a cut scene type of person... you might not like this game. As for me.... I loved it!!!So basically this game is wicked fun and if you haven't bought it yet... you HAVE TO!!!!!

Full circle... a seamless panorama of gameplay and film elements
I will start with the obvious, the game looks beautiful.  The graphical <br />quality does not change between cutscenes and gameplay.  Kojima and his team pulled out all the stops on the beauty of this game, as they have always striven to do.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />Then there is the story.  A lot of people harp on the Metal Gear Series because the story is full of twists.  One person even said that the plot was twists and only twists.  That person missed the point completely.  Especially by the end of this game, it becomes apparent what Kojima had been pushing for.  The message about humanity is clear... the MGS series has always been anti-war, anti-genetic determinism, anti-environmental determinism, every mistake that humanity has ever made with regards to war and control of the populous has been addressed in some way.  Consider the history through which Kojima derives his inspiration.  His home country of Japan experienced an apocalypse during WWII while causing an apocalypse in mainland Asia at the same time.<br /><br />In all situations of war no matter who begins the fight or where it starts or ends, the young will repeat the mistakes of the old, and the old will let the knowledge gained from their mistakes slip away with death.  Even the most heinous actions, deception, murder, are a means to an end, and the end is all that really matters.<br />SPOILERS OVER<br /><br />Gameplay was spectacular.  The MGS franchise is one of very few that has made significant gameplay improvements with every subsequent release.  Control of Snake feels much more fluid, yet at the same time you can feel his age in the way he performs.  Though he is more agile and powerful than the average human could ever be, he isn't quite the same old Snake.  He is THE Old Snake.<br /><br />Old Snake gets a lot of neat toys in this game, too.  Most notably is his chameleon suit.  If he lays flat, his suit will automatically adopt the pattern of the materials that are on the floor.  By pressing the "triangle" button while up against a wall, he will adopt those coverings as well.<br /><br />The second great toy is Drebin's shop.  Drebin is a weapons launderer who gives Old Snake full access to replacement ammo and other supplies.  ID Locked weapons can be converted to old-world weapons that do not require nanomachine permissions.  There are A LOT of weapons in this game.  First time through you probably won't get to experience all of them, and that is okay.  Just check them out on your next run.  The game is only about 10-15 hours long depending on how you choose to play.  Also, through Drebin's shop Old Snake can modify his weapon.  The first weapon, the M4 Custom is a good all-purpose weapon.  It packs a decent punch and holds 30 rounds.  It can be modded with a shotgun attachment, grenade launcher, or foregrip for stability.  Laser sights and scopes can also be added to the M4 and other select weapons.  So play around and have fun.<br /><br />Toy #3 is the Metal Gear Mark II, Hal's minature Metal Gear Rex that is mostly harmless...mostly.  When you need a buddy to turn the corner and remain unseen for you, Mark II can cast an invisibility cloak and make sure the coast is clear.  If things get sticky, it has a shock wire function to incapacitate unsuspecting foes.  The same tool can be used to knock on surfaces to distract your enemies and guide them away from Old Snake's true position.  It is a neat little gadget that you may or may not find to be useful.<br /><br />Next up, the enemies.  In this game, it is impossible to hate the enemies you fight (except for Vamp) because they are amazing, flat-out.  Whether they are GECKOS (bipedal beast machines), FROGS (all-female supersoldiers), or Private Military Company militia-men (remnants of their humanity will keep you grounded), or the Beauty and the Beast Corps (best enemies in of all time in videogames?), enemies are not just targets.  Kojima and his crew made the enemies in this game characters to be admired.  They neither have names nor faces, but they will f*** your day up very quickly if you do not respect their power.  From the top down, they are all capable killers.<br /><br />The humanity of this game lies within Snake's allies.  Meryl, Eva, Hal, the Colonel, Mae Ling, Raiden, Rosemary, Naomi, and especially Sunny represent the other side of life.  Old Snake is a manufactured product of war, the only life he has ever known.  No machine can imitate or destroy the compassion that these individuals shared.  This is passion.  I won't go on, can't explain much else without major spoilers.<br /><br />Gameplay, people, visuals, this game is stunning.  Metal Gear Sold 4 exemplifies why videogames deserve to be celebrated as art.  It has the story worthy of novel publishing, breath-taking visuals, engrossing music, and an all-around realism that we celebrate in paintings such as the Mona Lisa.  If only more videogame producers put this much time and effort into a game.  Production for perfection... long hours, perspiration, and inspiration to produce the culmination of one's efforts... that is art... this is art.<br /><br />If you are a casual gamer, this is not for you.  If you have never played the other MGS games, this is probably not for you.  Play through MGS1-3 in order to get the story and gameplay straight, and then play MGS4.<br /><br />For everyone who has been trying to compare this game to COD and HALO...come on.  MGS4 is not a pure shooter.  They put it nice and bold on the cover, "Tactical Espionage Action".  That means be sneaky and use force only as needed.  Play a "shooter" and judge other shooters with it.  MGS4 is NOT, I repeat, is NOT a shooter.<br /><br />Could this go down as one of the best games of all time? Absolutely.  Game of the Year?  For sure.  It is in a league of its own.  Nothing else plays like it.  Few other games are as engrossed in the mystique of political/sci-fi conspiracy.  Too few have such dedicated stories.  In most games, the producer's passion is not as apparent.  MGS4 had a 105 degree fever with Kojima's ardor for gaming perfection.  The game feels like he and his team cared.<br /><br />Gameplay 5<br />Video 5 - Cutscenes are long but not at all boring<br />Audio 5<br />Story 5<br />

"War Has Changed..."
Pros:<br /><br />+Very satisfying story<br />+Incredible voice work<br />+Incredible cinematics<br />+Eagle eye attention to detail<br />+A lot of gameplay elements<br />+Memorable Music Soundtrack<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Long cutscenes.  To the point where you feel more like you're watching than playing.  This goes a long way as you'll play for five seconds to be treated to cutscenes several minutes long<br />-Some load times are really annoying<br />-The Camera can sometimes be a pain<br /><br />After three and a half long years of waiting, Metal Gear Solid 4 finally drops down on the Playstation 3.  With a lot of questions to answer and some mighty big shoes to fill, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily one of the most anticipated video games ever made.  For the Metal Gear fan, the game is absolutely fantastic.  Continuing an already mesmerizing story, Metal Gear Solid 4 proves to be one of this generations greatest games.<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 4 is the conclusion to Snake's story.  The game is told through some gorgeous cutscenes.  There's a lot of detail to the characters faces, their actions and it has some fantastic voice acting to boot.  You'll want to grab some popcorn, though, because there are definitely a lot of cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4, and some of them are really long.  This is easily the biggest problem with Metal Gear Solid 4 and it's one that has often plagued the series.  While the cutscenes are very dramatic and well written, and while they even shed some humor, some of them are just too long, some of them seeming almost useless.  If a cutscene is getting a little long, though, it would be a grave mistake to skip it as you might miss some important parts of the story.  And if there's any Metal Gear Solid game one should be playing for its story, it's this one.  The other big problem with the cutscenes is how they come at you, even early on.  There are moments where you'll play for a matter of seconds only to be sit through a cutscene that's several minutes long.  At the very least, you can pause the game during the cutscenes.  However, it's hard to get over the fact that some of them really drag on.  When you get to play the game, though, Metal Gear Solid 4 is amazing. <br /><br />Metal Gear Solid has always been about stealth.  The same is true of Guns of the Patriots.  The difference being that you're also in the middle of a war and there are two sides fighting against one another, the PMCs and Militia.  You're able to help the militia and doing so can have its rewards, such as characters being willing to give you items or being able to go through certain areas more easily. Although, you can also turn the Militia against you. <br /><br />There have been some improvements to sneaking around, though.  The camouflage system has returned but it's much better.  Rather than having to go into the menu constantly, Snake's camo will change automatically to blend in with the environment and help him evade enemies.  You can also hold up enemies just like before, only this time you can perform body searches while holding them up rather than having to shake them down.  You can also restrain them to the ground to knock them out.  If you really need to get by an enemy and you're running out of options, you can always play dead.  This also works when you get spotted and knocked down by an enemy.<br /><br />There's also the implementation of the Solid Eye.  This is more vital to sneaking around than anything.  It works very similar to the radar in Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, showing you how much noise you or your enemy is making.  Also new to here is the threat ring.  The threat ring surrounds Snake at all times and will begin to act up depending on how close an enemy is to him.  All of these seem like they'll take forever to get used to, but you'll quickly adapt.  Just like previous games in the series, if you're spotted, you'll have to escape from the enemy and hide.<br /><br />There are also moments where you can take control of a Metal Gear Mk II, a very small version of Metal Gear that is controlled by Snake.  This little guy allows Snake to scout out the area ahead.  You can also use the Metal Gear Mk II to stun certain enemies.  <br /><br />Lastly, Snake has a psyche gauge.  This is very similar to the stamina gauge in Metal Gear Solid 3.  The gauge depletes depending on how stressed or exhausted Snake is.  You can refill this by eating certain snacks like Rations or Noodles, but you can also refill it by resting for a while.  But there are plenty of factors that affect Psyche.  For example, if Snake has been in the sun too long, you'll have to move him into the shade.  If he's been in cold water, you'll have to get him out of it.  As his psyche gauge gets lower it becomes harder for him to perform certain actions, such as being able to aim properly.  In other words, from time to time Snake will need to rest.  Though there are also certain points in the game where his psyche gauge is restocked automatically.<br /><br />You won't always be in stealth mode forever, though.  There will be times when you have to fight, and the shooting mechanic works much better in Metal Gear Solid 4.  When you're thrust into combat, the game plays very similar to a third person shooter.  Allowing for more precise aiming and no longer forcing you to go into first person view to land a well placed shot.  There's also a weapon shop where you can purchase, upgrade or customize weapons to your liking, another element that works to your liking and gives Metal Gear a lot of customization.<br /><br />All this variation in gameplay means that Metal Gear Solid 4 has several different ways to approach it.  Combine it's various gameplay elements with a selection of difficulty levels to up the challenge, and Metal Gear Solid 4, like the three before it, becomes a game you'll want to replay again and again.  Sometimes it's just fun to mess around with your enemies or just to see how else you can go about a certain area. <br /><br />Visually, Metal Gear Solid 4 is incredible to look at.  There's a ton of detail in the environment, and the atmosphere is also a good one.  You're very much immersed in the world of Metal Gear Solid 4.  There are a couple of load times that can be annoying, especially the installation.  The camera, while it's great, can sometimes be a pain.  It's easy to control, but sometimes you'll find yourself fighting with it.  <br /><br />Music wise, there's a memorable score to Metal Gear Solid 4.  There's a lot of voice work as well.  Much of it is great, although at times you will get the feeling that some of the voice actors and over-acting.  On the whole, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a beautiful looking, (and sounding) game.<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 4 is an amazing experience.  If you can handle lengthy cutscenes you'll be satisfied with the final results.  If you can handle a couple of annoying load times, you'll be satisfied.  The amount of gameplay here is incredible, and the fact that there are so many ways to go about each area is also a lot of fun.  For Metal Gear fans, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily the reason to own a Playstation 3.

First Next-Gen Game
This is the first truly next-gen game to grace either console (PS3/360, the Wii is different). The sheer detail and feature sets are amazing. It's a singleplayer game with the benefit of multiplayer, unlike many games which are the reverse. This is crucial, as many modern games trend toward the opposite. The graphics are, to put it less than eloquently, "HAWT." Controls are fluid and very deep (the sheer volume of actions/interactions is staggering). This is a STORY-DRIVEN game, someting that this generation of games is often lacking imo. I haven't seen this much emphasis on this all-too crucial aspect since Lost Odyssey. The soundtrack is at times haunting and always appropriate, really accentuating the experience. The campaign is lengthy and rich. Warning, if you're not a fan of excessive cutscenes, you may be put off by MGS4 (although you CAN skip them). I for one love the game for this reason. There are so many little details that cater to the player's enjoyment, such as the ability to play music in-game on your virtual ipod, the songs and extras scattered here and there, and the inside humor. Even if you're unfamiliar with the series (I have experience only with the first Metal Gear Solid game) it's definitely worth a purchase. This is a system-seller plain and simple. Every gamer who calls themself as such should own it. The first truly next-gen does not disappoint. Snakes last dance must be experienced.

A new standard for next gen gaming
Very impressed with this game so far. The controls are MUCH better than I ever could have hoped for, and they finally caved and switched the X and O buttons so that they match every other game in existence as being confirm and cancel respectively.<br /><br />I can't speak to the storyline yet as I'm only a few hours in, but it seems solid so far although I'm sure there will be a few bumps in the road later on as with all MGS games after the first.<br /><br />Graphics are outstanding, controls are intuitive for the most part (Stance changing can still be a pain, but improved from MGS3), gameplay is intense and interesting, cutscenes are exciting, I really have very little to complain about.<br /><br />As far as complaints, the graphics can tend to break down a little bit in some of the larger environments, and you can see a little bit of texture artifacts in the distant walls and buildings. Nothing huge, but I noticed it.<br />Also, the enemy AI can be a little sad at times, at least with generic PMC levels on the battlefield zones. I've found that just sniping at guys from a few streets away causes them to panic and take cover or call for backup, but not necessarily attempt to return fire or flank you.

End of an Era
Without blowing any story details, I'm just going to get this out of the way: Metal Gear Solid 4 - Guns of the Patriots is the conclusion to the Solid Snake era of the series and it has been done right, and better than what I had in mind. Simply, there's no way I could have asked for a better ending than this. I've always been a fan of the MGS story lines, and this is my favorite part of the story. I understand Hideo Kojima has talked about the series continuing but without him being directly involved anymore as well as the absence of the long-time protagonist Solid Snake, but after this game fans would be left to question where would the series go when MGS5 comes out? Well, we won't know until then so let's enjoy MGS4.<br /><br />MGS4's gameplay shouldn't be a stranger to fans of the older titles, however there are some noticeable differences. The CQC (Close Quarters Combat) system button is now "R1" instead of the "O" from MGS3, you fire weapons with (at least) two buttons (one to aim then another to fire), scope and camera zoom-ins are use the D-pad to magnify, the D-pad during the control of Snake does not move him, and the system of acquiring weapons is a bit different and the process is rather unusual for MGS games (you do more than just picking up guns off the floor). There are additions to holding-up such as patting enemies down to steal items, there are TONS of weapons in this game, a great variety but you'll never need some of them, and there is a "psyche meter" (similar to the Stamina from MGS3) and a stress meter which all take effect in Snake's performance. Aside from that the game is still no stranger to MGS fans as it still has the same feel after you get used to the new control system (I do have to say firing the gun easily took some practice and patience because it was so frustrating at times, but auto-aim eases it up). If you were disappointed in the lack of radar in MGS3, then the "Solid-Eye" is a nice welcome similar to a radar. Camera angles are totally free and can be controlled with the R-analog stick. After you get used to the controls, like I said, it's a breeze playing through like the old titles in the series.<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 4's playthrough is similar to the old MGS games - self-explanatory. Cut-scenes are one of the beauties of this game along with it's graphics despite the lengths of them. Be prepared for long cut-scenes and if you plan to watch them all, get ready for many (and I mean MANY) hours of gameplay. But in my opinion the scenes move the story along, and it's very engaging. I hardly noticed the lengths of them until I got my total play time at the end of the game, I was very engaged in everything going on in the game to every action and emotion, and I love the addition of flash-back images in the game that give me memories of playing the older titles and seeing how the story of MGS4 came about because of the previous events. So MGS4, like the other titles, is very cinematic and the most cinematic taking advantage of the PS3 technology, but fans of the series shouldn't be burdened by this if they are intrigued by the storyline and the continuity. <br /><br />In a way I would consider this game mostly for people who are already fans of the series. The storyline wouldn't make as much sense if you hadn't played the previous titles and understand what happened and all. If you just played through without getting the stories on the older titles you'd enjoy the gameplay here as well. <br /><br />In conclusion, MGS4 is an amazing game taking advantage of being on the PS3, the gameplay and gripping storyline should appeal to the fans of the series, and it's worth it to check out the conclusion of Snake's era in the series. 5 Stars, highly recommended!

A must buy if you own a PS3!
This game made me cry. No I didn't finish it yet, and there are no spoilers in this small review.It made me cry because of the fantastic visuals, gameplay, story (atleast the 7 hours I've been playing it since I got it on midnight release). This game is just too epic. I am not even a true Metal Gear fan, and this game blows me away. <br /><br />A definite must buy if you own a PS3, regardless of the fact that you are a Metal Gear fan or not. Even if you haven't played any of the previous Metal Gear games, you will still end up loving it, and you will truly enjoy this game.<br /><br />If you don't own a PS3, I would definitely recommend picking one up just for this game, if you have the money, or at least wait until future price drop.<br /><br />Final words:<br />Stunning! Epic! Legendary! Majestic!<br /><br />

Game of the Year
What a great time for this game to come out, because I was just getting bored of Grand Theft Auto IV. Metal Gear Solid 4 is the best exclusive PS3 game bar none. I only played the other Metal Gear games a couple of times years ago, but it didn't take me any time at all to get into this one. Sure you watch the game as much as you play it, but it's so nice to look at I didn't mind one bit. By the way, the graphics are probably the best I have ever seen. Ignore all the XBOX 360 reviewers on here who are just mad they can't play the game of the year.

Nice, nice, and hopefully a helpfull review
First before I start, remember MGS is NOT A FPS! IT'S A SNEAKING GAME and this game is mainly for the fan base. So with that said I will now start the review.<br /><br /><br />Storyline: Great story line I believe, plain and simple. Very detailed, thought out, and well executed.  My best advise for is to research the story before you play, so we don't have to read more "The story sucks" type of pointless reviews.<br /><br />Cut scenes: Yes..They are long, but remember its MGS. MGS is most of all a interactive story. And back to the point, the cutscenes are beautiful on both HD and Non-HD. Great use of in-game graphics.  I love the alternate views and flashbacks with the R1 button.<br /><br />Game play: Nice tweaks with the controls and camera views. When the camera is in a bad spot, you can easily use the joystick to fix that. Other then that not too much else comes to mind.<br /><br />So all in all, this is my personal opinion, and I just hope with some of what I said would remove at least a few moronic reviews about this game.  Also please, please stop comparing to COD ya idiots. Different game Genera.  <br /><br />1 last note: COD4 does rock =D<br /><br />

Too tired, can't think of a clever title right now
I would like to start off with a comment on the newbie reviews which have criticized this game for playing more like an interactive movie than a game. Such criticism would be just fine, except it is the frequently expressed philosophy of its developers - they market their games based on the "movie" aspect, and remarks by Hideo Kojima and much of his staff + company to that effect can be found on the Internet. Complaining that this plays more like an interactive movie is like going to Iron Man  and complaining it about it being a Super-Hero movie. Nobody tricked you, and if you'd done adequate research before buying it (which you're supposed to do for any costly product), then you would have known it wasn't the game for you. Now, there are some sophisticated reviews by old-timers that also criticize this for playing more like an interactive movie, and while I don't agree with them completely, I have some respect for their judgment. <br /><br />First, the storyline. Well, like all the Metal Gear Solid games, it includes scenes that other developers would have only included in the out-takes, that is, the funny actor goof-ups they show after a movie. Basically I mean scenes which break the fourth-wall or seem too ridiculous to actually be apart of a serious commentary on genetic engineering, living in the Age of Information, and warfare and its effects on the economy and world culture. Similar to the negative comments about this playing like an interactive movie, this is kind of the signature mark of both the game series itself and the developers in general - thematically speaking, Metal Gear Solid is very postmodern in both style and focus, and these disruptive scenes are consistent with that spirit.  <br /><br />As for the plot: it is a masterful conclusion to the Metal Gear Solid series as a whole, synthesizing bits and pieces from all the old games to create a finale which leaves all the mysteries explained. I did feel it betrayed (completely reversed) some of the spirit of MGS1, but I suppose that makes since considering MGS1 and Shadow Moses was "the beginning" and MGS4 "the end." Some will complain the story is presented in a fragmented manner which makes it difficult to comprehend, but that's in the eye of the beholder - to dedicated fans who supplement our playtime with whatever information we can learn about the Metal Gear Solid universe on the Internet, understanding should come easily. Bear in mind, then, that this storyline will only be fully appreciable to someone who has played other games in the series first and enjoyed the experience. If you fall short of that mark, I recommend putting off MGS4 until later. <br /><br />Now, the gameplay. It reminds me of the rest of the series. It is frustrating in some respects, but still a unique and worthwhile experience you won't find in any other series in the market. That by itself elevates MGS4's gameplay to a high status - if it is unique, worthwhile, and you can't get it in any other series, then it assumes a value higher than its shortcomings would otherwise make it. There is still nothing better than sneaking your way past armed squadrons or hacking away at their numbers in your preferred manner. The freedom of movement and style in Metal Gear Solid is part of its appeal. <br /><br />Now, a few complaints tempered with some positive remarks: <br /><br />... the Psyche Bar had potential, but it wasn't the best subsidiary health bar we've ever had. It fell short of what I experienced in Metal Gear Solid 3. On Normal Mode, it didn't influence my playing at all until quite late in the game, and even then, it was only a minor inconvenience. That is the mark of its overall ineffectiveness to me. <br /><br />... I liked how each of the bosses had a back story, as opposed to the Cobra Unit, two of which had essentially no back story (The Fear and The Pain). I didn't like how the back stories felt generic both substance (they were all pretty much the same, although I guess it was inevitable considering their tragic pasts were a common tie), and in presentation - Snake should have interacted more with the Beauty and the Beast Unit, as he did during MGS1, Raiden did in MGS2, and Big Boss did to a lesser extent in MGS3. That would have fleshed out their personalities better. <br /><br />... while it was a masterful ending for the series as a whole, the ending of MGS4 in-itself for-itself was a bit of a let down in some ways, though my mouth was open (figuratively speaking) from beginning until end, so I can't complain too much. <br /><br />That said, 5 out of 5 for: <br /><br />1. A storyline which masterfully concludes an epic series I felt certain couldn't be concluded in a way that didn't feel forced or contrived. Flaws aside, wow. <br /><br />2.A gameplay experience which, in spite of its shortcomings, nonetheless offers something special that can't be found anywhere else.<br /><br />Oh ... graphics and other special effects ... well, this review is long enough and other people have covered those things in greater detail than I would. <br />

Snakes Last Stand...
Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is one of the (if not THE) greatest achievement in gaming history. It creates a new standard for not only stealth & action games but for all genres period. This is the last game where Solid Snake will play the main protagonist in the MGS series, and this proves to be his most heroris mission yet. The MGS series has always been knowned for its presentation, and this ones no different...the presentation beats the hell out of movies these days and no game I know has the kind of presentation that MGS4 does. The gamplay has changed and probably for the better, the new over the shoulder shooting style fits the game very well and its the best thing that could have happened to the gameplay in my opinion. The graphics and sound are the best I have ever witnessed, even Mass Effect or Halo 3 can't beat this. The game may not sell millions of copies like Halo 3 or GTA IV but it beats those games in gamplay and presentation bar none.<br /><br />Things have changed, Solid Snake is aging super fast and has less than a year to live in the world. But B4 he dies he has one final mission to do and that is to stop Liquid Ocelot (his brother) from controlling the world. Snake cannot do it alone so characters new and old show up to his aid to help defeat Liquid once and for all. The Game is truly breathtaking and allows certain freedom that previous Metal Gear games didn't allow u to do. For example you can either choose to kill or not kill whoever you want and it effects the game completetly. The game is taking place in wartime between the PMC's and militia and if u so happen to help militia or the PMC's they will help you in favor. The game is so diverse in so many aspects that it is truly overwhelming, over 70 weapons and items at ur disposel, new gadgets like the Metal Gear Mk.II adds a new take on the game and allows players to strategize be4 they do anything else. The new weapon system is similar to Resident Evils system of weapons where you can purchase and sell items to a gun launderer named Drebin in real time whether ur in a boss battle or just walking around scouting the area, the new system really comes in handy. The Game is truly a masterpeice and will impact the gaming world without a doubt.<br /><br />PROS:<br />PRESENTATION - The Metal Gear series has always been known for its gripping storyline and breathtaking cutscenes and this one is no different. From the minute you start playing you alrady feel like you are part of the game, thats how powerful it is. (10/10<br /><br />GAMEPLAY - the game provides diverse gamplay for both practical and veteran players. The new over-the-shoulder aiming system to the new weapons system to the new gadgets like the Metal Gear Mk.II OctoCamo and even an "IPOD" the game is really fun to play and mess around with. (9.5/10)<br /><br />GRAPHICS - the game is BEAUTIFUL in every aspect. To the character models faces to the shadow and particle effects. This is the best looking game I have ever seen, it has one of the most realistic water effects in any game, the dirt and snow effects are surreal. Every little technical detail is amazing, this game beats the rest out of the park in graphics, I haven't yet seen a prettier game. (10/10)<br /><br />SOUND - This is where the game really shines, the voice acting is the best in the business. Long-time fans will never get enough of David Hayters voice (Solid Snakes voice) he improvises since Snake is now Old Snake emphasis on the "Old" part. The voice-acting is so natural that you would actually believe these characters were real-life people. The music by again "Harry Gregson-Williams" with Nobuko Toda is breathtaking, the orchaestra  is masterful full of strings and piano and horns and really creates the atmosphere of the game. (10/10) <br /><br />MULTIPLAYER - I haven't played the full versio yet because Im still playin the campaign but I was involved in the beta couple mothes back and it is pretty damn good. If you play the campaign than the multiplayer should be second nature because the gamplay mechanics is the same, even the drebin point system is involved in the multiplayer. If you played the old MGO (Metal Gear Online) that came with MGS3: Subsistence, it is nothing like that infortunately. Personally the old MGO was a lot more fun and faster with pretty simple mechanics but the new one is a little awkward. It is slower and a bit more complicated but technically its the same...kinda. Its fun thats all you need to know. (9/10)<br /><br />CONS<br />-The hardcore fans (like me) will appreciate the lengthy cutscenes and the unveiling of the Metal Gear saga and story...but for newcomers I suggest you play the previous MGS games because you WILL get confused. The cutscenes are great and exciting but sometimes I wish I was more involved. <br />- The game is 60% cutscenes and 40% percent gamplay, its not as bad as u would think but since this is the conclusion to possibly the greatest video game series of all time, you would expect this kind of thing. Its better than MGS2's lengthy cutscenes because those were boring as f***.<br />- The new weapons system is great and convinient but it makes the game a bit easy, but it is fun.<br />- THE TRULY SAD PART ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS POSSIBLY THE LAST METAL GEAR GAME AND IT REALLY BRINGS A TEAR TO MY EYES.<br /><br />There really is no bad part to this game, but for newcomers they might find some flaws that they won't fully understand. The game is truly a masterpiece and for hardcore fans this is just as good as sex, this game summarizes the whole Metal Gear series and concludes it. Almost every question that has been asked in the MGS series is resolved and answered and it truly does conclude the series in a satisfying way where everybody has there somewhat happy ending. To Solid Snake you deserve a good salute<br /><br />FAREWELL SNAKE ITS BEEN FUN!!!!

The Grand Finale of the Solid Snake Saga
Funny how the original 'Stealth Espionage Action' game was born. Failed to create all-out action game due to the limited technology, video game auteur Hideo Kojima instead created a game where you avoid firefight and sneak around the enemy. Since the original inception of Metal Gear in 1987, the series have always represented the best of the best the gaming industry can offer. <br /><br />Although loosely linked, each iteration was stand-alone game that requires no knowledge of the previous games. It all changed in MGS4. If the past installments slowly build the background of one of the finest video game storyline, MGS4 not only creates an immensely excellent stand-alone plot, but also brings suddenly all previous story to the stratospherically mythological level. One must experience all past games to fully understand and appreciate the level of genius MGS4 provides. MGS4 interweaves all the story so clearly into one satisfying epic culmination and brings its story to a closure. In doing so, Kojima eradicated all the past shortcoming and confusion in the plotline of 'MGS2: Sons of Liberty', and making Raiden the coolest video game character you wish you could play as. (Never thought that was possible, did you?) The ultimate joke on us compliment of Sir Hideo Kojima and his far-out sense of humor for ridiculing him on MGS2 for so long. <br /><br />Close Quarter Combat (CQC) was improved upon MGS3, and not only you have free-camera, the 3rd person perspective is now over the shoulder instead of over the head, you have the 1st person-like accuracy. Furthermore, you now can shoot and move around in the 1st person perspective. All the movement and combat mechanics have been vastly improved and refined here compared to MGS3. <br /><br />MGS4 is a stealth action game first and foremost, but now you have freedom to choose how you go about your tactics. You can sneak around without killing, or you can sneak around killing everyone. But most of all, you can just go around killing everything that moves. With tons of high tech weaponry at your disposal, you no longer have to rely solely alone on stealth.  Improved upon camoflouge suit from MGS3, you now have octocamo suit. It adapts automatically to any environment you touch.  You also have 'snake eye' that replaced binocular and also works as infrared goggle.  You also have a useful aid from miniature metal gear called 'MK II' to survey the surrounding and even knock your enemy unconscious.  All these do not mean the dynamic of the gameplay changes into all-out action like gears of war.  You have to constantly monitor your psyche level.  Continuosly shooting your way around will decrease your psyche level that directly affects your efficiency in combat so stealth is still your best course of action.<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid (MGS) series always pushes the envelope to the very end of bleeding technology of its time. But here deploys Hideo Kojima a truly amazing in-game cutscenes generated by in-game engine to the CGI level seen from Final 'Fantasy VII: Advent Children'. All the staple camera techniques frequently seen in top Hollywood production is deployed here. They even use hand-held camera technique. We are talking about cutscenes directly generated by in-game engine itself, not pre-made cutscenes like CGI (computer-generated imagery). Truly beyond amazing achievement if you ask me. Natunally, the gameplay itself also looks outstanding. Possibly the best looking video game to date. <br /><br />All the good looking graphics and techniques will mean nothing without excellent voice-actings headed by David Hayter as Old Snake. The music composed by Harry Gregson Williams is another area MGS4 matches on par with the top Hollywood production. Voice-actings and music enhance the overall cinematic experience to another level. <br /><br />Level design is nothing short of excellent. His near perfectionist attention to details is shown in every single rubble in each level. Maps are very large, although devided by small section and loading screen. One fact that always bothers me no matter which game it is.  Loaging screen here is not as bothersome as ones in RPGs but bothersome nonetheless.<br /><br />There are so many hidden jokes, references to the previous games, and his usual far-out, often wierd sense of humors you need to find to fully appreciate how deep the game as whole truly is. <br /><br />Is this game perfect? No game ever is. But in this case, I am more disappointed for what it doesn't have. <br /><br />*****SPOILER WARNING***** <br /><br />First of all, the game is still too short for game of this magnitude. Gameplay itself last about 14-15 hours if you attack everything in linear fashion. Cutscenes are about 7-8 hours; total about 20 hours give or take a little.  'MGS3: Snake Eater' still stands as the longest game in the franchise. <br /><br />Next, Shadow Moses was a somewhat letdown gameplay-wise.  First time I enter Shadow Moses, and I hear 'Best is yet to come' from MGS1 in the background, it was a spine-tingling experience.  Then I run into Gekkos and suicide Gekkos.  In the plot sense, that was inarguably the best course, but I wanted to play more stealth action against soldiers and alarms and turrets as in MGS1. I can only hope in the inevitable 'Special Improved Edition' in the future, they give us a standalone mission set in Shadow Moses guarded by the FROGS, turrets, and alarms with boss fights at the end of each stage as bonus so they don't have to disturb the existing plotline. <br /><br />Next, we need cinema mode just like in MGS3: Subsistence so we can watch all the cutscenes and concentrate in story alone. Right now we can watch all the briefings cutscenes but we need to play the game again to watch the rest. <br /><br />Next, VR (Virtual Reality) Mission is something you could use to finetune your techniques just like in MGS1 and MGS2. Virtual Chamber in MGS4 just doesn't cut it. Give us VR Mission in the Special Edition. <br /><br />Finally, I would never thought I would say this. I want to play as Raiden. Give us Raiden, Kojima-San. Maybe Raiden's mission like Snake's Mission in MGS2. Better yet, how about the alternative path like 'Ada Wong' in Resident Evil 4 Director's cut so you can blend him in the existing plotline such as Battle with Vamp, etc. I humbly ask for your forgiveness for our ignorance of the past. Pretty Please with lots of sugar on top, Give us Raiden. <br /><br />Get the limited edition if you can by all means. It comes in excellent and cool-looking hardbound case. It contains the same original game disc in original Blu-ray case with artwork. But it also contains the second case that harbors two discs. One is Blu-ray disc contains about 150 minutes worth of documentaries from the history of MGS to the Making of MGS4. The other is soundtrack of MGS4. Must-have collector's item for the long time series fans. <br /><br />At last, Solid Snake's story comes to an immensely satisfying grand conclusion. This is one game that is meant to be thoroughly experienced; you invest your time in characters and storyline so much, you feel attached to the avatar in your actual gameplay. MGS4 is as close to Hideo Kojima's envisioned Magnus Opus since the inception of Metal Gear in 1987. At the end of the game (Be sure to wait and watch until the very end title shows), you will know you just experience the most cinematic video game ever created. The emotional resonance will ringer long after the end credit rolls. MGS4 is man's game like 'Dirty Dozen', not a cheek flick like 'An Affair to remember'. Just like all the previous MGS games, your heart will be filled up with such emotion that makes even grown men cry. Go ahead! Stand attention. Give this soldier a proper respect and one last salute. He really deserves it with all your heart.

Pure brilliance
It's finally here.  After what has seemed like an eternity of waiting, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is here, and not only is it a stunning achievement in terms of technical aspects (this game utilizes what the PS3 is capable of like nothing you have ever seen before), but it also conveys one of the deepest and most engrossing storylines that you will ever come across in a video game.  Yes, as you have no doubt heard by now, the game features some quite lengthy cut-scenes that seemingly pop up out of nowhere in the middle of gameplay.  While this can get annoying, nearly everything else about Metal Gear Solid 4 is simply flawless.  The storyline, what little can be mentioned without giving away a barrage of spoilers, finds an aging Snake in the middle of Liquid Ocelot's new, destructive plans.  Familiar faces are abound as well, which will lead to many surprises and shocks, even for the most hardcore of Metal Gear Solid fans.  As said before, Metal Gear Solid 4 boasts the best audio and visual presentation you will ever see in a video game.  Quite frankly, this game is a gorgeous sight to behold.  Gameplay wise, the game offers up some equally impressive shooting and stealth mechanics, while the boss fights are nothing short of epic.  Online multiplayer modes seem to be the only aspect of MGS4 that don't conjure up the awe-inspiring moments that the rest of the game does, but they are fun on their own regardless.  Words alone can't do this game justice though.  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is by far and large the best game to come out on the PS3 thus far, and without a doubt is one of the finest video games to ever see the light of day.  Yes, it really is that good, and if you have been waiting for that PS3 "killer app", your wait is over.

Solid Gold Gaming
The Good Things<br />*Excellent gameplay.  The controls are not too hard to master.  The level designs are great.  There are lots of weapons and items to use.  Enemy AI seems pretty good and somewhat challenging.  You can interact with the game in many ways; you can even do stuff during cutscenes.<br />*It's not all about shooting or killing.  Much of the game involves sneaking and problem solving.<br />*Graphic and sound quality are awesome; probably the highest quality I know of.  Lots of details, textures, reflections, lighting effects, etc, all in glorious HD quality!<br />*Storyline and characters are immersive, interesting, and told in a very cinematic way.  Some scenes are visually striking.<br />*Some good inside jokes.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The story may be confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the whole franchise (like me; I don't understand much of it).  But it still makes some sense for the uninitiated, and is still worthwhile seeing.  Fans of the series may pick up better on the history, characters, and homages throughout.<br />*Not for kids; contains bloody violence and swearing.<br />*You seem to spend a lot of time watching cutscenes (but in most cases, you are able to interact a little bit with them.  Besides, some of them are totally awesome).<br /><br />This is the first game I've played on the PS3, and I can't seem to stop playing it.  The gameplay is fantastic, the storyline is addictive, and the graphics are beautiful.  Highly reccomended to any gamer.

Metal Gear Solid 4 - A game/video perfection
Metal Gear Solid 4 is the first game i've bought as a pre-order, and i admit, i fell into buyers remorse as soon as i got it. Bare in mind though that this is before i placed the game into my ps3. Having opened the box and actually placing the game into the system you are welcomed by a installation screen, it was a bit of a wait (suggest you snack as the messages in this part tend to just repeat themselves, so you wont miss much) I was unhappy for the wait at first, but as soon as the game started, all was forgiven.<br /><br />The visuals in this game are the best I've seen to date. Konami really brings out the power of the ps3 here. There's intricate detail, from facial features like Snakes chapped and old lips, to his old wrinkly skin. Besides Snake the enviroments are done exceptionally well too. Decaying residential areas scarred from battle, you can see walls cracking, falling, etc. Bottles on the floor. Even the enemies and other characters get the ps3 visual treatment. You wont be disappointed at all.<br />Plus it runs at 1080i/p for those of you who have old school hdtvs like i do which is just awesome, and completely appreciated these days due to the lack of 720p compatibility, we're usaully stuck at 480p. Thanks Konami!<br /><br />The Sound is just as every bit of amazing as the visuals, you get immense detail here too. From the cicada sounds of a nearby Gekko. To the communicating enemies near the hall you're at. To the chicken, birds and other animals that are going about life near you. The music is killer too, but it's just as expected from the Metal Gear Solid series.<br /><br />The gameplay controls are great, you've got fps aiming L1 and Triangle (the game control screen says just hold Circle for FPS, but it's not working for me) and auto aiming just holding L1. The trigger is R1 and underneath those two are L2 and R2 which are there for your equipment and gun setup. You've got your movement/aiming and camera control on the two analog sticks, simple right? Triangle to stand or lean at an object and x to crotch (light button push) or lay on the floor (hard button push). The Start button brings up you're equipment menus, codec, and save options. Everything flows in terms of controls.<br /><br /> Now for the plot, well that I won't ruin, but it won't fail you in that department. Many people complain about the too many cutscenes in this game, this is a clear sign it's their first experience with the Metal Gear Series, it's always been like this since day 1. I've always digged them, granted though some are a little too long to watch, but people have their own opinion, regardless if you just want a game to play, use the online option instead, it's pretty good in it's own right. (just don't expect to go in running and gunning or you'll be on the floor dead like i was the first one hundred times :) ) The beta had a few lag issues, but I'm pretty sure they've probably ironed most of the bugs out.<br /><br />If you have a ps3 Metal Gear Solid 4 is a must own !....or atleast a rent (if you're that cheap...) you shouldnt skip it out even if you're one of those people who avoid games due to hype, you will only be missing out on what will be the game of the year for sure and probably hurting yourself from a masterfully done experience. <br /><br />**A funny tidbit: This is probably the first Metal Gear to utilize skin pores lol, don't believe me? Just check it out play Metal Gear Solid 3,2,1 and compare it to 4.

The reason to buy a PS3
I will have to start out by saying I am a MGS fan from NES days. That simple statement is to warn people that while I try to be as honest as possible I do have some bias towards the game and series. <br /><br />If you don't own a PS3 yet MGS4 is the reason to buy one. This is the fitting end of an era for Solid Snake and the game is a master piece of art, story and gameplay. That said this is Hideo Kojima's story and he is going to make damn sure you see it. While I am not sure of the percentage I would guess at least a third of the game is made up of cut scenes. You will watch through entire stages of cuts scenes, only to save and watch another one before getting to a playable stage. For the less than total MGS fan this can be quite annoying. Luckily you are able to skip the scenes if you want, though you will lose all understanding of the story in the process. And like all previous MGS titles on the PS systems this is a complex and convoluted story. But for the fan it will answer so many of the questions that have up to this point been unresolved in the series. <br /><br />The gameplay is typical MGS but even more refined and precise than before. While I thought it would be hard to top the control available in MGS3 this game has done it. Snake moves with amazing precision, but with a real world weight to him. Snake is an old soldier and it shows. But while any other person his age would be home watching TV, Snake is out to save the world one last time. The years of hard live come across clearly in the gameplay while not being an unnecessary hindrance. The fact that Hideo Kojima was able to pull this off is amazing. The amount of Easter Eggs and homages to the series and his past game means several play through are in order for the fan. The amount of gear and weapons also means most players will play through several times just to make sure they have experience all the action. <br /><br />You can not go wrong with this game, be it for the hardcore MGS fan, or the fan of action games in general. This is the fitting end of Hideo Kojima run on this amazing series and it ends with every bit as much emotional investment as Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. There may be Metal Gear games in the future, I hope there are, but this is the fitting end of Snakes tale.

The most epic game probably for 10 years to come.
This game has beauty written all over it. This will probably be the most epic game for years to come. It is going to be a long time until something takes the title of "Most Epic" from Metal Gear Solid. No game has yet matched this game in sheer quality. Gameplay..Story..Graphics....Beautiful.... Play it and you will see what I mean.

A Masterpiece!!
Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a marvelous blend of video game and cinematic experience!! I have only played Sons of Liberty before and found it somewhat incomplete and limited in detail. But this game has combined cutting edge graphics, wonderful gameplay, endless weaponry options and a mesmorizing storyline beautifully complimented by one of the most moving and powerful musical scores ever in a videogame bar none!! This game not only captures the imagination but the flawless storyline and ending lift the human spirit through the rollercoaster of tragedy and triumph.<br /><br />I purchased the 80GB Playstation 3 Metal Gear Solid Package over the Motorstorm package and I have been absolutely blown away!! Marvelous Game!! Well Done!!

First Person Shooter junkie
Before anything I shall state I'm a hardcore fps gamer. So as you might expect I'm into fast paced games like COD4, RFoM, and Gears of War (yes, I know that is a 360 game and not quite FPS but you get the idea). Therefore, I had my doubts with respect to this game as it is stated as a tactical spy game. As a matter of fact the only reason I got it was because it was a gift LOL. Couldn't be more wrong, the game is absolute gold. And the long cutscenes a lot of people complain about are actually very welcomed by me. They give me plenty of time to rest from the constant stress that causes me to try to sneak out behind enemies.  An additional advantage of the long cutscenes is that for a first-timer in the Metal Gear series, this game explains everything so I actually feel lost regardless of its "complex" story. Moreover, the game allows you to play however you like, you might as well blast thru it and kill everything in sight or sneak out and avoid detection at all costs.

Fantastic -- Hasn't left the drive slot since purchase.
I'm not going to get into a detailed and thorough review of the game, since this has been done already.  I just have a few points to mention. So you know where I'm coming from, I played through MGS1 and MGS2, but only played MGS3 for a short period at a friend's house.<br /><br />This game has not been ousted from the PS3 since the day I bought it. I have found it to be almost infinitely replayable, which is pretty uncommon these days.  I've completed the game 5 times so far, and I'm about halfway through my 6th run.  I'm already looking forward to my 7th run and figuring out what I want to accomplish that time around.<br /><br />Sure, the cutscenes are sometimes long (often with the standard helping of MGS cornball), but they are well done, and worth watching the first time around.  You can easily skip them on subsequent playthroughs, as you already know what's going to happen. :)  At any rate, that particular complaint never really made sense to me -- I LIKE it when a game takes a while to get through.  And I'm not so impatient that I get upset if I'm not pushing buttons every second.<br /><br />I have tried numerous methods to complete the game -- pure stealth, pure speed, and kill-everything-in-my-path, and they are all rewarding experiences in their own way.  I think my 7th run will be "Nothing But Knife". :-)

Full Metal Solid
Metal Gear Solid 4 (MGS4) may well be one of the best games ever made. This isn't a gross overstatement, this is just a fact, a reality of the situation and the consequences are staggering. MGS4 has delivered on a gaming benchmark that really makes all other games fade in comparison. When I first got my PS3, I got it boxed with a very popular action game (no points for guessing). MGS4 was on the shelf and I remembered how well I enjoyed MGS3: Snake Eater but the hype was about the game I had in the box. In reality, the boxed PS3 should have been sold with MGS4 and the real hype should have been about this `final entry' (debatable) in the Solid Snake series. So if you are thinking about a PS3 box then I say look not further than the new MGS4 one.<br /><br />MGS4 is an evolution in gaming. This is not just a development in tactical espionage games or a better story. This is an entirely new way to game. MGS4 makes abundant use of the PS3's networking capabilities. Lots of content such as music for snake's iPod (yeah it works like a real iPod also) and his camouflage gear are released at intervals online by the MGS4 developers. There are even exclusive MGS4 podcasts. So MGS4 is not just limited to the extensive BD content, there is probably going to be years of content updates ahead.<br /><br />MGS4 is absolutely massive. You get approximately 30 hours of a game from start to finish. There are days of game play involved. There are several Acts where you can play with snake. You are advised to play MGS4 sneaking. This means less shooting, more hiding and you will enjoy the game more. The less you shoot or CQC the more fun you will have but you need the patients to maybe hang around a wall or bush for several minutes. In fact this game requires a lot of patients. It is the way it has been designed. It is full metal emersion in a stealth world.<br /><br />Act 1 - Liquid Sun<br />This is urban war in a Middle Eastern city. Snake fights with or against local militia. You are introduced to new tech like a remote control robot, Metal Gear Mk. II, gun purchasing and gun unlocking. You also get to fight in a hotel. This map is gigantic and the stealth play is impeccable.<br /><br />Act 2 - Solid Sun<br />Here you are on South American terrain. This is close to the sort of setting found in the Russian forests of MGS3, however there is no snake eating or growling stomachs. There are more open areas and buildings to climb. You will enjoy the stealth play here a lot.<br /><br />Act 3 - Third Sun<br />Prague, Czech Republic. Snake sneaks around this European city at night. This really challenges your ability to tiptoe and avoid detection. Snake in the city is a great idea and the execution is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Act 4 - Twin Suns<br />Shadow Moses Island. This is from the first MGS. It is a huge industrial complex that Snake must penetrate. There is also lots of snow covered terrain and blizzards for snake to get through.<br /><br />Act 5 - Old Sun<br />A submarine/battleship. Snake moves around inside this warship for the final showdown. He takes on more than one end boss here. It is very hard to play this as a sneaking mission and depends a lot on shooting.<br /><br />There are also dozens of boss fights and at least a few hours of cut scenes to get through. There are too many guns with adaptors to count as well as accessories galore. By the end of the game you have only experienced a fraction of what you could have used and will probably go back and play the game more than once and play it in a different way. For this reason MGS4 has a very nice long lifespan.<br /><br />Snake's moves have been made easier. The CQC is a little different than snake eater but offers some things new. There are multiple holds available as well as new ways to engage the enemy, but more importantly, these controls have been made easier than the steep learning curve that came with MGS3.   <br /><br />The graphics are impeccable. At times it is like playing a modern anime or Manga movie which is to say it is like playing the cut scenes in MGS3. However some of the cut scenes in MGS4 are 3D animations that you can move around. The music and sound effects are top notch. To put it in perspective the closing credits run like the ending to the movie Titanic. That is how much work has gone into MGS4.<br /><br />The story is very complex and often hard to follow so you will have to be on your toes. MGS developers released a back-story add-on you can download over the PS3 Sony Store. This will familiarize you with MGS1 to 3. With that said, the story is a good one and has to do with the war economy and has a lot to do with Snake's family but be prepared to sit through it. Once you know the story you can skip them on your second or more play.<br /><br />MGS4 comes with multiplayer. That is a whole other game involving players in maps shooting it out with each other. There is not much stealth involved though as it is pretty much straight forward gun battling within complexes. And of course being on the PS3 multiplayer is free.<br /><br />Installing MGS4 can take some time. There are a few minutes of installation between each Act. However when done loading times are not bad and save times are instantaneous. Anyway the bottom line is that anyone with a PS3 is going to get this. You could say this was made for the PS3 or the PS3 made for this and you wouldn't be far wrong. It makes full use of the PS3 and quite frankly the only thing that can try to compete is a high end PC (but with what game?). So right now, as it stands, the PS3 offers quite possibly the best gaming experience with MGS4. It simply blows away any and all games on other consoles and the PC. That is a blue moon event in the world of computer gaming.<br /><br />Pros<br />The best stealth game ever<br />Maybe the best game ever<br />Makes full use of the PS3<br />Revolutionary graphics<br />Huge levels and design<br />iPod and podcasts<br /><br />Cons<br />It ends<br />Makes other PS3 games pale in comparison<br />No snake eating

Incredible for most, not for all
I bought this on it's release day along with a DS3 controller. The very beginning of the game through me for a loop as there were several abstract videos played that I couldn't seem to skip. I didn't mind at all that the game had an up front installation. It was actually pretty quick. On to playing the game. I did mind that it has an install between every act and that if two people are playing it you'll constantly be re-installing the current act for that person.<br /><br />It's full of story. Most of which is a bit overblown japanese oddness but it kind of grows on you. The acting is well done for a game and Snake is a very interesting character to follow. I'm the type who likes a good amount of cut scene and story. I like to relax a bit between gaming. To me the perfect amount of this was done in Uncharted and Ratchet & Clank Future: TOD. MGS4 goes well beyond the amount of cut scenes in those games and they are a bit less compelling to watch. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy them.<br /><br />The game play is pretty incredible. It's easy to control snake, it's a ton of fun sneaking up on bad guys and the camo suit never gets old. There are a few short comings. Moving your gun 180 degrees in a fire fight takes awhile. It's understandable that Snake is old but it seems just a little too slow. Also it seems very easy to just shoot everyone with the tranq gun and sneak past.<br /><br />So the game is not perfect, why did I give it a 5? It's because the game does so many things so well and has such a great attention to detail in so many areas it definitly deserves it. The graphics are really great but beyond that the sound is AMAZING. The camera work is one of the best I've seen in a video game. Not once did I get dizzy and only when on my belly in the dark under something is it difficult to see what you're doing.<br /><br />Technically the game is one of the most impressive things I've seen in gaming. For those of you concerned, it is also a lot of fun. I personally like Uncharted better but that takes nothing away from this game given Uncharted is one of my favorite games of all time.<br />

Triumph And Frustration
Metal Gear Solid 4 is all the triumphs and shortcomings of the entire Metal Gear series writ large. The game is beautifully made, with the best cut-scenes ever made for a videogame, and breathtaking sound and level design, especially in the first stages of the game.  Hideo Kojima, the mastermind behind the series, couldn't care less about any criticisms: it is his baby, and to play the game to the end you have to accept the short game, long cut-scenes and occasionally unresponsive controls.<br />	<br />As the Metal Gear series ostensibly ends with this instalment of Kojima's epic and often convoluted conspiracy series, there is a lot of explaining and tying up of loose ends to do before the final credits roll.  Kojima's avowed love of cinema has never been more evident than in MGS4: ultra-lengthy cut-scenes often mean the player can put the controller down for a good twenty minutes at a time.  The cut-scenes themselves are the best ever made for a game: character modelling and the hi-def rendering are amazingly detailed, with only some of the myriad plot twists letting the side down in spots.  The sheer amount and duration of these in no ways lessens their quality as the game progresses. Of course, critics of the games in the past will repeat what they have said in the past: games are to be played, not watched.  The occasional quick-time button pressing during these scenes (in order to trigger comic-book flashbacks)  and the ability to move around during the briefing scenes only emphasises the passivity that comes from these scenes, which take up roughly sixty percent of the entire game experience.  As one of these critics in the past, I would answer that the cut-scenes are of such quality and add so much to the Metal Gear universe that they largely mitigate the relative lack of gameplay in the MGS4 experience.<br />	<br />Gameplay itself is very similar to previous iterations of Metal Gear Solid.  The responsiveness of the player character (an aged version of famous Snake Plissken) is generally good, but my gripes about his slowness to turn, stand after executing rolls, and lie down flat still stand.  The game engine -including enemy A.I.- is essentially the same as Snake and Raiden's debut on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.  The engine is ageing, like Snake himself, and this sometimes lets down the otherwise diamond polish of the graphical and sonic production.  <br />	<br />However, the central issue with gameplay is that there is simply not enough of it.  The first two acts, with their innovative Faction system, are probably the best in the game, with technically stunning chase sequences involving a bicycle and a Metal Gear mech later on too short-lived to really imprint themselves in the mind after the game is over.  Furthermore, an almost-wonderful stealth mission based on a foggy doppelganger of Prague is too on-rails to be truly satisfying.  The question remains, as it has since MGS2: does Kojima have enough confidence in the (now ageing) game engine of Metal Gear Solid to expose it more to scrutiny? Or is he just so in love with his self-made myth to switch off his cinema blinkers?        	   <br />	 <br />A promising online game comes with MGS4, which will add hours to the overall Metal Gear milieu.  But replay value comes with the knowledge that the best the game has to offer comes early on, with sizable dialogue scenes coming to edge out the generally excellent stealth and shooting action.  Of course, lovers of Metal Gear Solid won't care, and detractors will find little to really switch them on to Kojima's baby this late on. MGS4's biggest recommendation is it is a Metal Gear game, par excellance; its biggest criticism is it is a Metal Gear game, par excellance.  Now go enjoy!  <br />

Awesome!
I am not sure exactly if some people have played earlier mgs games b/c my understanding and expectations would be this game is gonna have a lot of just movie time and not game play before I even played the game.After playing I still think the game is well balanced and the movie parts as another way of just telling the story.There is plenty of game play time though.I figured if you were familiar with earlier installments you would expect this bigger version to have movie time.This game does have a lot more of it though.I simply noticed people who hate the game usually had something to say about the non-interactive moments.<br /><br />I found myself just listening to the sound of the game and its amazing.The sound effects are phenomenal.The graphics are amazing.Flaws in this game are few and in between.Even from the 1st intro of Geckos I found my heart racing.<br /><br />Fans of the series odds are will love this game even if I did hate it.I am not a huge fan of the series but I have enjoyed playing them and following the story.This is the best so far for Playstation 3 and greatly needed to show off the system strength.I own a Xbox 360 as well so finally my PS3 is getting a lot of game time.

This has made my top 5 of all time!
This game is THE GAME OF THE YEAR<br />I dont want too make a long review I just wanna say that's it's really the best PS3 game and for that matter best overall game on any current gen console I know I got all three wii ps3 and 360 and nothing comes close too this game.<br /><br />Graphically it's the best I have seen.(I dont play pc games)<br />Gameplay is what you want it too be frantic non stop action or you could play defensevly most of the game, it really is what you want it too be action packed or suspenful sneaking game.<br />Controls are the best in the Metal Gear series.<br />Sound is the best in the series aswell the music and fx are top notch(I dont have surround sound though)<br /><br />If you have a PS3 this is the game too get if you wanna enjoy a videogame and if you are on the fence on a PS3 and you were waiting for this game well dont hesitate too buy into the hype because now that the game is on the retail shelfs there is no hype, it's a fact Metal Gear 4 is the GAME OF THE YEAR.

High quality entertainment
ACII should be summarized as great story telling mixed together with fun, realistic game play.<br /><br />The story really flows from the beginning and draws the players into the history and the intrigue.  The amount of detail and effort put into the game environment is amazing.  And the open world reminds me of the play in GTA4 where you can jump onto basically anything, swim in the water, run around the rooftops and hide in all sorts of places.  <br /><br />In addition to the main game story and missions, there are a ton of side quests!<br /><br />If you are into action/adventure games, ACII is definitely worth getting!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Hugely Satisfying and Entertaining...
First off, I haven't played AC I and a newbie to open world themed games. But reading all the positive reviews of AC II prompted me to try it and I have to say I hugely enjoyed this game. I really enjoyed this game broadly for its story, pacing, attention to detail of the environments, character development, voice acting, rich color pallet and varied missions. But what really stands out are Renaissance era Italian cities. They are literally living, breathing characters in this game. I have to commend the developers at UBI Soft for painstakingly recreating these cities and their architectural marvels in gorgeous detail and staggering scale. In my past life I had dabbled in Architecture and been fascinated with Italian, Greek and Egyptian architecture. Just being able to run around these cities, scale all historic buildings and take in the magnificent cityscapes from top of view points as the camera revolves around you, was the next best thing to actually being there in person. The experience is quite visceral and astounding. If you scaled the Florence Duomo Cathedral, you know what I'm talking about. <br /><br />Apart from that, the missions are quite varied and don't seem repetitive at all which was a big complaint against AC I. The voice acting with Italian accents and dialogue for most characters are spot on and added more authenticity to the game. Character development for lead character Ezio Auditore and other important characters are quite well done and the actor giving voice to Ezio seems to have really put some effort into it and it shows. Other than that, the population of the cities have colorful PCs and NPCs from thieves, brigands, mercenaries, prostitutes, nuns, annoying minstrels, merchants, announcers, messengers and normal citizenry. The navigation and combat controls are not that difficult to get used to and navigating the cities and climbing felt natural.  Navigating using the map took some time to get used to in the open world but once down pat, felt quite comfortable. You will get lost in the cities unless you use the map! The AI system seems better than most other games and not that forgiving that you feel unchallenged.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Gorgeous and detailed environments.<br />2. Lengthy game and huge cities to explore.<br />3. Excellent voice acting and character development.<br />4. Interesting storyline - Integration of real life historical figures and incidents into the storyline is nice.<br />5. Monetary system - Earning money and spending on upgrades added an interesting aspect to this game. But midway/three-fourths through the game you will have money to burn and nothing to do with it afer all the upgrades.<br />6. Apart from main story line there are non-essential side missions like assassination contracts, races, message delivery, beat ups, finding feathers, unlocking futuristic conspiracies etc. which adds a ton of replay value.<br />7. The developers have achieved a lot of breath in game elements variety and little less in depth.<br />8. Decent AI.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />All accolades aside, there are some blemishes in this well-made game. <br /><br />1. A lot of characters look blocky in close-ups and dating back to PS2 standards of rendering while the environments themselves are gorgeously rendered making this a glaring anomaly. In doing the inevitable comparison to Uncharted 2 and God of War 3 in terms of overall graphics, AC II going to come off as second best.<br />2. Combat leaves much to be desired. The choice of weapons and how you earn them is interesting. Its not for lack of variety in combat moves and weapons but its just that combat could have been more fluid. I guess I'm less forgiving in this aspect as the bar for combat has been set very high after playing the God of War series. (I know, I know I should not be comparing a hack and slash with a third-person action adventure :))<br />3. Much as I try to get into it, the Animus concept just doesn't fly. <br />4. The final boss fight felt a bit tame and the ending abrupt.<br /><br />I'm at a stage in life where family and professional obligations don't allow for playing at a stretch where day turns to night and then back again. I found Assassins Creed II to fit the bill perfectly and I played this on and off for a couple of months till I finished it at my own pace.

One of the best games of 2009!
I'll say I was not a HUGE fan of the original Assassin's Creed. It had beautiful graphics, a great open-world environment and a fun gameplay engine, but was hampered by level repetition and a horrid use of a dual story. Thankfully this sequel not only fixes these issues but surpasses expectations as a game itself.<br /><br />Like the original, AC2 begins in the future with an escape from the first game's institution. Thankfully this segment is acton-packed...and short. Within minutes you're back in the "game" world in late 1400's Italy. This (like the first game) is where AC2 mostly takes place. If you're like me and absolutely HATED the bits in the future of AC1, don't worry. You spend maybe 10 minutes a piece split up into three segments (though the middle one seemed a bit longer) in the future world. I still hate that you have to leave the game world proper at all but at least it's only for 30-40 minutes in an otherwise 30+ hour game. Yes the game's THAT LONG!<br /><br />Your hero in this game is Ezio. He's an Italian noble and has alot more personality and is alot more fun than Altair from Assasin's Creed 1. He's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the future bits) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through 30 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note (you can even switch to playing the gamein Italian with english subtitles!).<br /><br />The gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. They leave out all the investigation bits of an assasination but add more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These again are VERY fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules an complexities as you work through them.<br /><br />Speaking of varied, aside from the basic story missions which will see you fighting, flying, riding horses, piloting boats and escorting/protecting characters there's also a villa you can upgrade to get discounts on weapons/armor/clothing/medicine etc. I've never played a game that gives you so much to do in so many different ways. While none of the custimization and mission structure is new to games I don't think all of these elements have been brought together so seemlessly before which is the big reason I like it so much!<br /><br />Also, if this isn't the best game of the year it has one of the best soundtracks. The music is not only original and cool it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc). The developers really went out of their way with this one.<br /><br />Aside from a slow first few (story based) hours Assassin's Creed 2 will hook you and never let go. I still think the Animus is an intersting but failed idea, but it doesn't even remotly take away from the awesome things you can do in this game. There's still time before the end of the year but I can't think of too many games that will be able to top this one.

What a Game!!!
This is one of the BEST GAME on PS3. period. Just buy it and enjoy it. I have never beaten a game this quick. This is not a short game by far. I spent about 70+ hours in just 2 weeks. It is very addicting.<br /><br />It made me want to go buy Assassin's Creed 1.

The most realistic, lasting, and exciting game I've ever played!!
Assassin's Creed II makes massive improvments over the original.  The main improvment is it's NOT repetitive.  There are many more mission types.  Ezio can do so much more than Altiair like swim and fly.  The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant.  There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades.  The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself.  The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.<br /><br />OK, let's start off with the big man Ezio Auditore Da Firenze.  He is the son of a father with two sisters and another brother.  At first, you start off running errands for your father like delivering a message or letter.  To make a VERY LONG story short, your father and brother are killed and you vow to extract vengence on those who were involved.  This includes anyone from a poor theif to an extravagant noble.  The voices and actions of the people are very realistic.  They sound like they're right in the room.  As you walk through the town, citizens cough, sneeze, fight, sing, talk, and rob.  Pickpockets will steal from you.  If you catch them, you can get your money back along with more.  Sometimes some guys will come up to you and start singing.  They are really annoying because they stand right in your way and won't move, so usually I grab them and hurl them across the street.<br /><br />What's there to do?  Plenty.  Of course you have your main mission types were you tail someone, beat them up, pickpocket them, or assassinate them.  The side missions have really changed from the first.  Courier is one where you deliver a letter ASAP.  Beat up events are where you beat unfaithful husbands to persuade them to focus their attention back to their wives.  Assassination contracts enable you to do a quick job and wipe out from one to ten targets.  Races allow you to show your skill in roof hopping.  All of these main and side missions give you money.  More money for harder missions.  That's right.  There's an economy.  You earn money for missions, pickpocketing citizens, and finding chests.  There are shops scattered around too.  The blacksmith repairs your armor after its been damaged in a fight and sells you new weapons and ammo.  What ammo?  Throwing knives, smoke bombs, and bullets for your wrist gun (Ya it's cool).  The taylor sells bigger pouches for your health, poison, and knives.  He can also dye your clothes if you want to look extra fly.  Artists sell you paintings to increase your uncle's villa's value and sell treasure maps to show you where hidden chests are.  Doctors either heal you on the spot or sell you potions for later.  These can help when you're in the middle of a battle and need health.  Doctors also sell poison for your poison knife (ironic isn't it?).  There are also cortesans, theives, and soldiers that are around the city for your to hire.  They either distract or fight guards with you.<br /><br />There are also 6 assassin tombs in all the cities.  Complete these and at the end of each one there is an assassin seal.  Bring these back to your uncle's villa to unlock Altiair's special armor (that's right they still dragged him into this).  It is twice as strong as anything else and can't be damaged.  Your uncle's villa gains value and earns you money.  Buy paintings or renovate buildings there to make it make more money for you.<br /><br />The weapons are excellent.  Ezio has two hidden blades and can use both at once.  He also can carry a sword, dagger, knives, health etc...  The enemy AI isn't bad for a typical game.  If you don't keep your guard up, they will take advantage of the opportunitity and strike.  But they're not too hard to defeat especially if you have hired help.<br /><br />Assassin's Creed II is a must play for every action gamer.  Everything looks and feels real.  There is much more to do and see.  The ending is much more suprising than the original too.  You might even learn a little italian too.

A major achievement in video games
well I have to say I am 46 year old (yes I have played games since I was 10, yes video games are that old, actually older, the original is from 1958 and I wasn't even born, I started with PONG) and my experience is different from younger people, having had played a lot of games, I mean I actually spent all my allowance in arcades when they were actually busy and that was more like $100 bucks a week in quarters!!!<br />I look at this differently being in all the cities that this game shows and the reason I bought the game was that I wondered how great it would be if I could climb on top of each and how interesting it would be to see the whole of the city... well in this game I get to do that while playing assassin.<br /><br />I bought about 14 new games I bought since October with the new PS3 250GB and that includes Uncharted 2, Batman Asylum, Bionic, Tekken 6, resistance 2, infamous, Modern Warfare 2, Mirrors Edge, Hawx etc.... And I can tell you they have done and amazing job of reality in this game and it looks and feel real when you play it and it's a great experience to enjoy when you play and not JUST A GAME, and that was done on purpose it seems and it intends on showing you more than just a video game to play and put away, I mean I finished and it was great but I think it's the first game I am actually going to play again. It's Batman, Drake and Laura put together.<br />I started playing on WED Night and mostly played 3-5 hours a night but if time permitted I would have loved to keep going but about 2 AM I really have to go to sleep since I wake up at 6 usually so this game does make you hooked and it's enjoyable at every turn and there is so much to do and so much fun included in that you do get to spend a good 3 days of play to go through it all.<br /><br />The graphics are amazing and I love seeing the same buildings I went to in Venice and Rome and Florence (Its one place you got to visit) and they practically look the same and Venice with the masks and the ball is all so much like the actual parties that happen there, I just loved climbing all the buildings and now when I go back I am going to look for a way to do it in real life, BUT there is no way I can climb that good or would chance it. The game is so real it scares my wife and she doesn't look at it when I do the jumps and etc! that's how real it looks. For those who have not traveled to Italy and haven't seen it, It's a great way of getting to see it and experience it, I rode more gondolas than I did in real life and went everywhere I didn't get to, it is missing the water taxis that are in now and some stuff that are new and the bridge is more built up today, but when you go to Venice you do get to see some pictures on shop walls from ages ago and this looks more real than the actual pictures do. <br /><br />It also has puzzles that intrigues your mind and is somewhat educational which I think the goal of the makers of this game was, there is so much to enjoy but if you want it just as a game to shoot and kill and etc it works out too, It's the best video game I have played as its enjoyable at every turn. I have about 80 games that I kept and as I said have played them over 30 years and can tell you I never thought we could come this far with the games as we have, I mean who remembers games on Commodore 64? Yes 64 now they are gigabits of info per second. The graphics are more artistic than real as MW2 and Batman seem to have somewhat Different graphics but that does not take away anything from the game, those are more for the story lines that don't look 100% real but no complaints from me.<br /><br />To make it short (or is that late?): The Ultimate video game experience of my life (so far, as I assume they have to remove the remote from my dead cold hands!)<br />I want to keep this game to pass it on to my kids when I get one! Or do I have to buy a digital one of those?<br /><br />OH one complaint, there is not as much interaction with the women, but don't tell my wife I said that.

A successful Sequel
I'll start out by saying that this game is an improvement in every way over Assassin's Creed. I started playing it right after Uncharted 2 so the graphics at first seemed a little rough at first, but considering how much more massive the game is compared to Uncharted 2, it is barely fair to compare. It didn't take long to adjust when the game sucks you in so quick. But don't get me wrong the game is beautiful, and the detail that has gone into each building and city is amazing. It is great to look from a view point and decide where you are headed next, knowing you can reach all of it.<br /><br />So first off the gameplay is a lot of fun, if you hadn't played AC or just hadn't played in a long time it will take some adjusting again to get used to the control set up. But they do ease you into the controls starting out with the most important aspect, free running. This is the only part of the game I found a flaw in. Ezio has a tendency to jump of things and grab onto things you don't really want him to, you can let go of X to avoid this, takes practice to time it right. It also doesn't help that the buildings have slanted roofs so you can't tell how far a jump is. This isn't Ubisoft's fault, but the mini map does help to see if it is a jump you can make. Other then that, the controls are great and a lot of fun to use.<br /><br />Now the story has improved greatly. It is slow at first, but toward the end things really start to pick up. I don't want to give anything away, but unlocking "The Truth" is worth the trouble. After unlocking the video I actually had to take a step back and remember that it was just a game and it was actual footage. I can't wait for ACIII to see what happens next.

Best Game Yet for the PS3
This game is AMAZING. It has an amazing story and even more Amazing locations. The graphics are the best I have seen so far for the PS3 and the gameplay is gripping. I found it hard to put down the controller. Though it only took me a week to beat this game. I played it for about 50 hours. That game play was only beaten by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BXKJ6O">Fallout 3: Game of The Year Edition</a>

My absolute favorite PS3 game...
Being new to the PS3 system overall, and the next generation consoles in general, I didn't really know what to expect.  I'd bought the PS3 for Blu Ray and Netflix streaming, so it wasn't until recently that I purchased a few games to see what they are like compared to the older consoles.  I was floored.  After a few games I popped in Assassin's Creed 2 and my jaw dropped.  The cinematics are amazing, but it wasn't until the game play that I found myself convinced that Assassin's Creed 2 is an absolutely fabulous game.<br /><br />Being a wide open sandbox world I felt like a little kid running everywhere, jumping, climbing, attacking, assassinating, fighting you name it.  The graphics themselves are beautiful and feel life like.  I couldn't help but wonder and walk around for hours on end collecting treasures and finding feathers, going to viewpoints and purchasing items from the various shops.  The controls themselves are extremely accessible and easy to use.  When you attack and fight it is not as cumbersome as Assassin's Creed (which I had played because of the second one), and it is immensely easier to assassinate someone (the main lure to the game) than the first one.  Additionally you can pickpocket a lot easier and the tedious steps of the first Creed (eavesdropping and pick pocketing and visiting the bureau) are all removed leaving the player with missions that are not tedious and certainly not repetitive (the chief complaint of the first one).<br /><br />All in all I found that I can get lost in AC2 for hours on end and not even blink an eye.  Running through Florence and Vienna are never tiresome and boring, never repetitive and absolutely love exploring the back alleys and rooftops.  Incidentally, looks like they are coming out with a new episode that will be based in Rome and include multiplayer (this will not be AC3, but a new Ezio episode stand alone game), so if you loved AC2 and wished you could have run around Rome (as I was hoping as I went to each new city) than look forward to this coming out beginning of next year.  Assassin's Creed 2 is easily my favorite of all my PS3 games I now own and is the benchmark to the quality of game I look for.  A most definite recommend.<br /><br />5 stars.

A Lot of Hours in a Fun Game
This is a game that you can play hours and hours and never get bored, very good history. some games are very good but after a few hours: is done, but this game is something special that I want in every game: "Very Fun and Very Long". <br />if you like adventure games don't even think about it, GET IT<br />

USED TO BE A HATER
YES, regardless what people say I HATE THE FIRST ASSASSIN'S CREED. EXTREMELY REDUNDANT AND UNREWARDING. Yes, I uncovered all the secret emails and even then I found the story to be horrible. JUST HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Anyhow last year AC2 comes out. I hear that they made massive improvements. Six months pass its release price is reduced by half and I had a gift card. So I decide to give it a second chance.<br /><br />I have to say I am quite impressed by AC2. Why?<br /><br />- MUCH BETTER PRESENTATION. <br />The game does a very good job in terms of explaining the character development while putting you in the front seat. Unlike 1st one it is not like you just go kill and get an upgrade, go kill and get an upgrade. The game takes you through so many events, each contributes to your motive, your thinking and your ambition as a character.<br /><br />-VARIETY OF WEAPONS AND GADGETS<br />As you may have seen in the commercial, this game features Leonardo de Vinchi. This genius will make you some really cool weapons and gadgets (double hidden blades, poison blade, pistol, flying machine etc.).<br /><br />-THE ELEMENT OF CURRENCY<br />Having monetary system in this type of open world game truly adds motives to the different activities in the game. You want to upgrade your weapons, your fort, well you need money. How can you get money? By performing variety of actions, such as stealing, assassination, beating up cheating husbands, investments (YES INVESTMENTS AS IN BANKING INVESTMENTS), racing etc. etc. NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL VARIETY. In the 1st Assassins Creed it was just like steal document, evedrop or collect flag which was pretty boring. Like first many of these events are OPTIONAL. So that is a HUGE PLUS. If you don't want to waste time feebling minor things. You have options to do so.<br /><br />-VERY INTERSTING MAJOR SIDE MISSIONS<br />Won't spoil, but there are two major secret items you can uncover by exploring very nicely designed HUGE SECRET AREAS and PUZZLES.<br /><br />-YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE STORY<br />Hated the first one. You could understand why you needed to kill people, but could not connect the dots as clearly as you can in this one. LOTS OF LOTS OF EXPLANATIONS PROVIDED should you be interested.<br /><br />-GREAT MUSIC and DECENT FACIAL MOVEMENTS AND VOICE ACTING<br />pretty self explanatory.<br /><br />For $30, I would say it is a MUST BUY.

Awsome
I was hesitant to purchase this game at first. I have played the first one and unfortunately it came up short in alot of the game play and content. In this sequel Ubisoft seems to have listened to all the fans and have fixed some of the problems Assassins Creed 1 had and raised the bar for the gameplay and content. All in al this game is worth it. It is fun,the graphics are amazing.. waay better than 1 and is a well balanced game.

Assasins Creed 2... My Review.
I recieved this game for my birthday, I had long since finished and replayed Assasin Creed, and was anxious to get started... <br />the graphics of the game, like the first, awesome! verry vivid detail. <br />the story line was Extreamly Better, no more listening to old wind bag at the beggining. yea! <br />GamePlay: this is proberly what you all have been waiting for. how's the glitches second time around... there was virtually no glitches in Assasins Creed 2. the only proberlem I had was if I played it for hours and hours the system would freeze, no big deal, most of the time. the only thing I found was the is you double blade assasinate two gaurds right after the first two it would freeze the game. I only noticed it after I had already won the game. after that I exspirenced nothing. <br />the gameplay was awesome. the sword fighting was alright, to me personally the little life measured the appear above the gaurds was a little unrealistic, but the sword play was, well, deadly. <br />the dual hidden blade's: they masterd the assasinating techniques with and you can defiantly kill a victim with more varitiy. you can assasinnate the pesky roof gaurds by the drop assasinate. which would have made the first game much more better in those assinine sisuations. <br />the game Assasin Creed 2 is EXTREAMLY GOOD BUY. I had only one thing I didn't like with the game. the adreniline that passed into you, the player's body, right when you plunge the hidden blade into your victim and the burst of adrenilin from the first game was awesome. really helped me move on in the first game. that thrill was like WOW! in Assasin Creed. I really felt connected with Altir in that. but it was somthing I didn't find the second game, it was just kinda like oh, there I killed him. no thrill. I felt it a few times in the game, but not enough to say hell yeah awesome thrill. it just wasn't there. other than that little did-bit there the game was AWESOME! <br /><br />JamesRollinsAndClemensFan01...<br />

Immersive Experience
This is what an action/stealth/role-playing game should be. In fact, as I was playing this game, my thoughts harkened back to the days of Ultima. This game should have been what Ultima 9 was. A pity that EA had to bury that franchise. <br /><br />After completing this game, I felt an immense epiphany; it is as if I have just finished viewing an epic onscreen. The story itself is epic. Following the grand tradition of movie sequels, this one picks up right after the first game. As Desmond Miles, you find yourself captive in a research facility run by modern day Templars. This time round, one finds himself transported back to the Renaissance era in 15th century Italy.<br /><br />The sandbox world itself requires many moments of just gazing at its beauty. The various synchronisation points offer the gamer a kaleidoscopic view of the various Italian cities. The views are simply breathtaking and spectacular. Venice deserves special mention. The scope of the city is really immense. <br /><br />Ezio Auditore, the protagonist, is a likeable rouge. More so than Altair. He starts off as somewhat a rich playboy but progressed into a master assassin through extraordinary circumstances. I like the fact that historical characters and even architecture features figures largely in the game. It's a joy interacting with Leonardo Da Vinci, Il Magnifico, Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander IV), even the dastardly Machiavelli makes a cameo appearance!<br /><br />This review is in regards to the PS3 version. I must say that I'm a bit disappointed with the quality. As [...] pointed out, there were a few visual glitches. Throughout the course of my gameplay, the game crashed thrice. Twice at the same spot, with me performing the same action - double assassination 4 guards in succession. I really do hope Ubisoft addressed the buggy issue and fix them in the near future.  <br /><br />UPDATE (24/1/2010): Ubisoft did a slight upgrade patch and there are no crashes so far. Kudos to Ubisoft for quick response time! I can't wait for the DLC to hit!

Great game but a couple of minor dings
Incredibly captivating adventure/fighting/3D-platformer game with tons of real Renaissance history, artwork and architecture. Batman:AA didn't hook me, and I haven't finished Uncharted 2 yet, and I never even finished Assassin's Grind 1 =) , but everything is going to wait until I finish Assassin's Creed 2. This game is certainly worth your gaming time! I won't restate what everyone else who gave this game a good review has mentioned, so I will focus on...<br /><br />A COUPLE OF DINGS NOBODY HAS MENTIONED!<br /><br />1) Savegames are COPY-PROTECTED. I am visiting my family for Thanksgiving and I wanted to bring this game to show my nephew while making a little progress on my latest savegame, only to discover that I cannot copy them to a USB stick! Ubisoft failed here. What if my PS3 hard drive dies? I've been able to back up EVERY SINGLE OTHER game's files but this one's. That's pretty sorry!<br /><br />2) A few times now my character has, in the middle of running across a floor portion of a map, acted as if he's at a roof edge, and "looked over the fake edge"... right at the floor 6 feet away. And come to a complete stop! I would have to wiggle around to get unstuck. Unfortunately this seems to crop up when least desired such as timed courier/race missions!<br /><br />3) Some of the timed race missions are extremely hard with very little margin for error (at least for me). Combined with the ease with which you can screw up a jump or accidentally climb a wall you merely wanted to run past, 1 error and you pretty much have to Abort Memory.<br /><br />4) Big battle axe and pike, which you can disarm from an enemy, seems unobtainable in-game. (The disarm ability is cool as hell, though! Try the pike, watch what happens when it breaks!)<br /><br />5) In-game mace weapons suck. A sword was almost always available that was better. What if I prefer to bludgeon instead of gut enemies? :) I think each weapon type should excel at 1 stat... Maces for damage, daggers for speed, and swords for parrying, but that wasn't really the case.<br /><br />That said, my favorite parts are certainly the map details (Venice is amazing!), the fighting variety, the historical footnotes, the Renaissance art, having a "home" you can upgrade for more income, and basically being made to feel like a total badass while within an unfolding story. Love the "suddenly there missions" like catching thieves, offing messengers and whatnot. Some people like the extra information-gathering stuff (codex pages etc.) but I'm more into the action and attention to detail. ;) Scaling a wall using any handhold available and leaping from rooftop to rooftop doesn't get old!<br /><br />As far as they went with the fighting, I can tell it can get even more interesting with well-timed combos and whatnot, I hope they push the next game in that direction more!

And the winner for best Do-Over goes to.....
Back in November of 2007, we were given a game that was said to be innovative, monumental, and one of the first "true next-gen experiences." Instead, to the majority of gamers who picked it up, it turned out to be a misleading, repetitive, and slowly paced title. Personally, I was so excited about this game and what it was suppose to be, it almost felt like I caught my girlfriend cheating on me when I saw the credits rolling. I was so distraught and saddened, by not only the game itself, but by the story and its cliffhanger ending that left a huge, gaping hole of unanswered questions, unfulfilled promises, and not one ounce of satisfaction that made me feel like it was all worthwhile. While others have pushed aside all of its flaws and saw it for what it was aiming to be, I am still standing here acknowledging Assassin's Creed as one of my most disappointing games of this generation. <br /><br />But, that was 2007. Flash forward to today, and its amazing how a sequel can make you fall in love with a name all over again. <br /><br />Assassin's Creed II accomplishes everything the original tried so hard to do, and does it perfectly. It is executed in a way that leaves you with the sense of wanting and needing more in the end, when the original just made you want to use the disc as a coaster. <br /><br />We're back in the mind of Desmond Miles. Only this time, instead of the Holy Land, its Renaissance Italy, almost 300 years after the events of the original Assassin's Creed. The world has changed and so has the way things are done. You play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze (rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?), who is out to make the wrong things right, and in the process uncovers a conspiracy that leads him to things you will not believe even if I told you. The game spans roughly 23 years. And within that span there are a few years not accounted for which will be revisited as DLC. But more on that later.  <br /><br />The story takes place throughout 5 different cities in Italy and then concludes in a final city. The world feels much more open now because of the lack of redundancy. Every city you visit has random assassination missions, races against thieves, guards to lure away with mercenaries or the local brothel, and so on, but even though it's the same in every city, they are not required so you can do these little side quests or ignore them. As for main story missions, there are a few that repeat. More than once you may have to follow someone without being noticed or escort someone somewhere and protect them, but missions like these are spaced out and done in ways that they don't feel repetitive, which is a big plus and a lesson learned. The overall pacing of the story is so well done and intriguing in ways that are so natural you don't think about it at all, which proves true since you can play for hours on end and not realize how long you've been playing until you notice that you've pee'd your pants.<br /><br />There is a lot of customization as far as Ezio goes. You can go to a tailor and dye your robes (different colors for different cities.) You also have a bunch of different weapons to play with, including smoke bombs, different attachments for your wristblade, which there are two of now, all contribute to good killings. Another fun, but short lived addition is that you are in control of your own small city. You get to use your money you collect to refurbish and rebuild the small town where your family Villa is located. This Villa is your homebase where all the weapons and armor you purchase will be kept and it's where you have to go if you'd like to swap something out. You can fix up the shops in the city and get discounts on whatever they are selling, and in turn, they generate money for you. So the more you build it up, the more money you'll be getting in return. It was a fun little venture but once everything is built there is nothing more to do but collect money, which leaves you with heavy pockets and nothing to buy once you acquire everything. Would've been nice if that was an ever growing town and you didn't run out of stuff to build.  Also, throughout the cities there are six Assassin's Tombs where you do some heavy platforming, a la Prince of Persia, to find tablets that are in the tombs of great Assassin's. Collect all six and you unlock Altairs armor, which might I add, is BAD ASS! These little platforming areas were challenging at times but were very fulfilling when completed. I wish there were more of them but at the same time, six was enough and here's why...<br /><br />My gripe with the game is one that I couldn't take lightly anymore. I got so fed up with it I had to shut the game off a few times. Since its open world and Ezio is jumping rooftop to rooftop like a beefed up monkey with a pack of Sugar Stix, you tend to get a little too excited. When you're in the moment and are either sprinting across roofs or running away from guards, you tend to run into the very unforgiving problem the game has and that's jumping/grabbing/falling over, onto, or into places that you didn't want to. This hurts the most when you have to get somewhere before a clock runs out (Assassin's Tomb) or you are chasing someone (one of the story missions.) You see what you want to do and where you want to go but you try and get there too fast and you either run up the wall or jump off the ledge which will kill your momentum (or just kill you entirely) and make you have to start all over again. This is something that can be avoided by taking things a little easier but at the same time, this game was meant for you to string together all these ninja like skills in one fluid motion, so it's hard to not run into messing up your flow. Maybe if the camera was a little tighter it wouldn't have been so frequent. But it happened to me so much I'll have to look at it as a flaw.<br /><br />Aside from that, there's nothing I can say that is bad about the game. The story and settings are spot on. The characters, along with the historic buildings you encounter all have a back story that you can access and read up on. Back stories so detailed you're tempted to look it up yourself to see if they're true. There's plenty to collect and solve. I highly recommend finding the 20 glyphs that when found, a puzzle must be solved for each. Once that's done you unlock a brief 1 second clip of a video that was left to you by Subject 16 (you, Desmond Miles, are Subject 17.) These clips, put together, show you a video that when watched will drop your jaw. I can sit here and tell you about it but like I said, you won't believe me. If you are into the story and what's going on, you NEED to unlock those clips and watch that video. The contents of whichyou see, coupled with what happens at the end will blow.. your... mind!<br /><br />As far as the DLC goes, I am not a fan of hearing about DLC right after a game comes out, but I'll make an exception for this. It is so cleverly done it's almost not right. The years that are missing from the game are acknowledged in game as missing, and the characters even say they'll get back to it later. The years are skipped and the game continues on without a hitch. And since it's such a smooth transition, it shows that nothing really happened during those years that are of any importance to the main story. So the DLC will come out as a simple add on that if you want to go see what happened during those missing years you have to pay to play it, which sucks. But at the same time, its not going to contribute anything to the main plot. At least, nothing too significant. The story started, went on, and ended pretty smoothly and was a fairly good length (about 23 hours to complete it and get a Platinum Trophy [sorry, had to brag]) so for that reason, them taking out years from the game and making it DLC doesn't really bother me. If the game was a lot shorter and felt like something was missing then yeah, I'd be pissed. But that's not the case. <br /><br />Something else to check out: Before you get started on the game this is definitely something to watch. It's a pretty high production value and the actors are the same as the ones that did the game. Its an awesome introduction to what's going on. It's called Assassin's Creed II Lineage. Somewhat of a prequel to the game. Just do a google search and enjoy.<br /><br />All in all, I consider Assassin's Creed II to be an amazing ride. I hand it to Ubisoft for seeing what they did wrong and fixing it. It's a great game, and a great story with a flaw that is annoying and will get you angry enough to take a knife and assassinate your pillow, but will be forgotten with the payoff at the end. The end... ha! More like the beginning. <br /><br />Oops, did I say that out loud? Sorry. <br /><br />The Verdict:<br />4.75 Water Bottles Full of Pee, out of 5<br />

It deserves the 5 stars
When I buy a game, I look for an experience, and this game delivers with high notes. I have had the pleasure of being in Florence and Venice and when I got this game I was curious of how Ubisoft recreated both cities in the Renaissance, and let me tell you, they put a lot of effort on it and when you are walking on those cities, they look real (I know I have nothing to compare against but the current cities). Yes, the controls are a little bit clumsy, but I really do not know how they can make them better, you have to accept that in an environment with so many things in your surroundings. <br /><br />If you want a 5 star experience, this game is definitively for you. <br /><br />UPDATE: Incredible game, just finished... amazing ending. This year in PS3: Uncharted 2, Batman: Arkham Asylum and Assassin's Creed 2.

PS3 Keypad Touch Too Sensitive???!! HERES THE FIX
Well i just bought the Keypad for PS3 today and ive been hearing that people complain about the touch sensitive mouse is way too sensitive and almost unusable. Well i thought that too when i first got it and  then i read the instructions. You have to seperatly calaborate the touchpad when in touchmode with ps3 for it to work properly. Heres the steps<br /><br />1. Go to Internet Browser<br /><br />2. Activate Touch pad(the hand with index finger pointing)<br /><br />3. Hold blue and orrange shoulder buttons for 2 seconds until the ligh flashes<br /><br />Now your touch pad should be calaborated. ENJOY!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Sorry if everyone already knows this just wanted people to know so they dont think its the keypads problem. READ THE MANUAL.

A great keypad
I preordered it along with a remote for the PS3 from Amazon. They are second on my favorite list of online stores. Newegg being the first. The release date for the keypad was supposed to be the 15th. Amazon shipped it along with my remote on the 14th. The stated arrival date was also beat by one day.<br /><br />Of course this thing is in the usual bullet proof packaging which is slightly annoying. Once I got the keypad out, I was impressed with the feel of it. I think it weighs a little less than the Dualshock 3 controller(s) that I have. It does add weight. Though for some reason the keypad does not seem to throw off the balance of the controller by much but it obviously does change the feel. I'm not a small guy so maybe that has something to do with it.<br /><br />The keyboard is automagically paired by turning on the keyboard and then plugging it into the PS3 with a USB cable. The instructions for this thing are hidden in the packaging. So pulling the cardboard out of the plastic and unfolding it reveals the paper foldout.<br /><br />Not being a small guy, my fingers are fairly long but thin. So I have only one small issue when using the keypad with my thumbs; I know how to type. I'm not the best but I rarely look at the keyboard. So using my thumbs to type will take some getting used to but it is obviously easier and less frustrating than using just a controller. Oh, it does have the raised bumps on the F and J keys, though I am not sure if those will help. The bumps make those two keys feel like they need to be deburred. They probably should have been put in the middle of the keys instead of at their bottom end.<br /><br />The keypad clamps onto the controller very nicely and does not move. The Start, Select, and PS buttons are extended through the keypad as shown in the pics and line up perfectly. There is a button on both the right and the left edge of the keypad. They are color coded and used to access the extra characters on some of the buttons. The shift key works as it should so the blue colored characters above the numbers (the usual exclamation, ampersand, parentheses, etc.) can be accessed by the color coded button or the shift key.<br /><br />The last feature is that most of the keys can be used as a mouse pad - just the letter keys. I hate mouse pads and since I hate them my review of this function is biased. I used the PS3's browser to check out the "mouse pad". Underneath the Sony logo are three buttons. The one in the center changes the keypad to a mouse pad. Using the keyboard as a mouse pad is jerky and I hate it even more than a mouse pad. Moving my thumb faster over the keys does not seem to engage any acceleration in the pointer. Going slower over the keys does not seem to work any better. All in all the left analog stick is much better for moving the pointer than Sony's attempt at a mouse pad function. Because I did not expect this feature, hate mouse pads and don't use them, I did not use this function as a factor in my rating.<br /><br />Matza-Ballz!<br />Drew

keypad fine details
i got this keypad here on amazon.<br />its arrived in the "red label", I've seen some on ebay with the "black label".<br />i think there are some variations between the red and black version. <br />which has some different/extra characters. <br /><br />-to the right of "L" you have strange "E'" instead the ";"(semi-colon, it's still there but its now a gold function key). <br />-to the left of "P" you have a "#" sign instead an "'"(apostrophe, also still there but now a blue function key).<br />-the "shift" keys are spelled out instead of having arrows pointing up.<br />-the "return/enter" key is spelled out, instead of having the left pointing arrow.<br />-some of the "blue" and "gold" function buttons are placed differently.<br /><br />im not sure if they are shipping out the wrong version or not. but this keypad has more "function" characters then the black label versions. which is a good thing!<br /><br />overall this has a complete qwerty keyboard but i wish the apostrophe and semi-colon were standard keys instead of function keys. <br /><br />

Yet another great idea for the PS3!
This keypad is awesome! It saves me sooo much time when I'm messaging friends either in chat or regular messages. The buttons are spaced out enough to stay comfortable and not have my big fingers pushing other letters at the same time. It reminds me of using my Qwerty on my cell phone so it didn't take much to get used to. I will say that the locations of some of the extra symbols are funky to remember, but you get it after using it a few times. It has some symbols I've never seen on US keyboards or any keypad alike, which makes it interesting when making clan tags online or something cause other people wonder how you got those symbols... bonus for me. lol Anyways, I don't like how close the "Message Box" button is so close to the select button.. I'm constantly pressing it in mid game when I go to check scores or something! Plus I don't see the point of the "Friends" button when the "Message Box" button essentially takes you to the same place. <br /><br />The touch pad is actually really easy to use! It's not jumpy for me like most other reviews say theirs does. I don't that those people calibrated it like you're supposed to do... it tells you how in the manual. lol Using it is ok, but there's not much of a point if your controller is right there... you can just use the joysticks! Although, I can see it being useful when it's being used with something other than a PS3, as it is Bluetooth capable. Speaking of, you can sync it with your PS3 using the USB (in the instructions) or the Bluetooth (general knowledge of electronics).<br /><br />It secures VERY nicely to the controllers and does not budge! Installing it is easy, taking it off is another story. Just make sure the long tab that stretches around the front is no longer clipped to the back BEFORE trying to remove it! That's all. It's not heavy, it's not bulky, it doesn't get in the way of the L1/R1 shoulder buttons, it doesn't block the charger USB port on the controller while installed, it goes in stand by mode in between uses while in the on position, plus it looks like it's part of the controller when installed! <br /><br />Very nice product!

must have keyboard for people who text and uses a PS3!!
This thing is small and compact.<br />Very simple to use, fast to connect.<br /><br />For people who does texting, this is more simple for you to use as you are quick with the fingers in a small environment.

When you've gotta text, do it write!!
What can i say? If you text while gaming, this piece is tha joint!! Ease of use. Compatible form factor. Not as snazzy at the XBox 360's, but it gets the job done, and it fits in with the PS3's "elite" appeal.

Put on your hat and bandanna, its gonna be a dirty ride! (no spoilers)
Synopsis: <br />From the team that brought you Grand Theft Auto, you are now thrown head long into a wild west adventure. You control John Marston. This game is set in the desert in 1911 (same year as my favorite .45 was made). You are somewhere near the Mexico border. John was a criminal that ticked off many people in his past and now has to atone for what he did. People come out of the woodwork either as his friends or enemies. <br /><br />My play experience:<br />On the PS3 the graphics are really sharp and crisp. The textures, the ambiance all bring the wild west to your home living room. <br /><br />In recent years there have been games that have tried to capture the essence of the western genre. For example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RTCOWA">Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</a> which on the surface was a pretty good game, it however was not a very good story. In COJ the main characters are brothers that are ex-confederate soldiers. The story never really grabs hold and to be honest I never finished COJ. The story in Red Dead Redemption is done so well that it never feels pushed or contrived. Instead its done like an old western movie. Its gritty and a world that beckons you back time and time again. <br /><br />For now let me discuss the cool features:<br /><br />Horses: +<br />I think they put a horse into a motion capture room and had him run around. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269DX5W">Assassins Creed II</a> the horse was a good way to get from town to town and the motion was pretty real. In Red Dead Redemption its super smooth an you feel like your out exploring the desert on a horse with no name... Kick your horse too much to get him to chase down that coach, you could be looking at a wild ride as he tries to buck you off. The longer you keep 1 horse the more stamina and other abilities it gets.<br />EDIT: I see they actually DID use a live horse to make the motion capture. It shows.<br /><br />You can also ride stage coaches and trains. Or rob them, its up to you. See gameplay below.<br /><br />Gunfighting: +<br />You are a real gunslinger in this game. To get prepped to get it I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5TVL2">Young Guns [Blu-ray</a>] and a couple of other westerns. This game matches the combat of say GTA and COD. Where you shoot someone matters, and it can affect your character in different ways too. Some of my opponents are gonna have a limp for a while at least.<br /><br />Atmosphere: +<br />There are critters running all over as you ride through the desert landscape. It feels dusty, makes me want to wear a bandanna as I play. When you get low on cash you can kill and skin critters for a few coin. There are actually many ways that you can earn money in this game besides being a hard criminal.<br /><br />World: +<br />So far its just massive. I can only compare it to the run from Commonlands to Qeynos in EQ. It seems to be fully explorable and I have found very few places I couldn't go. It really is huge. I have seen that someone said it was the biggest world ever done in a Rockstar game. Which is impressive considering that those games can go on forever. The land is great in that it hardly ever repeats as you ride. Matter of fact I haven't seen any textures or vistas that look the same. Maybe there are but they are so far apart that you wont notice it. An example of this is the train ride into the mountains in Uncharted 2. <br /><br />Towns: +<br />Unlike GTA you wont have a huge city to run around. Out west these were small settlements and usually had only a couple of hundred people in them. Think about all the old wild west movies you have seen where there is maybe 10 shops and a few houses in the town directly. The way they did the towns is very endearing, because it makes it an immersion type of game experience.<br /><br />Poker: +<br />I love the side games. I have lost my fair share of my real money playing poker and now I can do this in game too. <br /><br />Gameplay options: +<br />You can be the good guy or be a down right criminal. The game system supports either mode and varying degrees in between. This allows RDR to be more than just a shooter, but more like an RPG. Be careful who you pull your gun on. If you do it in town you can start something that will ultimately lower your honor.<br /><br />Controls: +/-<br />The controls are a bit different here and do take some time to figure out. But any game can be that way. If you go from say a driving game to a shooter you might hit the wrong buttons once and a while. After playing this for nearly 2 days solid now and not switching to other games in between, I have totally become comfortable with the controlling scheme.<br /><br />Multiplayer: NA<br />I do not enjoy multiplayer shooters. I am really no good at it so I tend to not play it much or at all. That being said I jumped in a couple of games and it was ok. If your a hard core multiplayer person please check other reviews for this. I would not do it justice because I tend to be jaded with regard to multiplayer games.<br /><br />Replayability:<br /><br />I am almost done and I can see where I would have like to do something different in the way I played this. That being said, I think that I could go back through and try it again maybe being a bit evil this time. For that I think that this is a game you could play over and over, adjust the story line, and enjoy it each time you did.<br />  <br />Summary:<br />This game is really appealing if:<br />A. You enjoy GTA type of game play, open world and a morality system that challenges you.<br />B. Fan of westerns and cowboy movies. If you hate them and think they are silly then you probably wouldnt enjoy this. <br /><br />If you are A+B then this game is a hands down favorite pick to have in your PS3 arsenal. <br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />Some Tips: (no spoilers)<br />I have almost 30 hours into this game and I am not done. I do goof around alot and like to go hunting and see what other mischief I can get into. Playing poker for 3 hours doesnt hurt either. That being said I want to drop some tips in to help those of you still waiting or are looking.<br /><br />Horses:<br />1. Dont get to attached to your horse. Think of them like a car, reason being there are tons of ways they can die. From random mountain lions, to getting shot by the enemy to you shooting them in the back of the head on accident when wolves are attacking (sorry skippy :( )<br />2. When going in to attack a gang leave your horse way back and run up. When you have hog tied your bad guy you can whistle ^ arrow and he will run back over to you. <br />3. Dont buy a horse. I did and the thing got killed and I was out 1500 big ones. <br /><br />Gambling:<br />Like in real life its alot about luck so go in with the thought you'll do 1 buy in and when that money is gone leave, go kill some stuff and come back later. Your hands may improve<br /><br />Time:<br />1. Pausing the game with the start button will show what time it is. Saving the game gives you 6 hours of rest. If you like shopping be sure you go to bed no later than 3am. Then when you get back up the stores will all be open, and you can go out and have a blast.<br /><br />Camp:<br />Camp whenever you have a long ride ahead of you. As long as you have bought a map you can go to that place from your campground. Once in your campground you can select where to go without having to burn up the 6 hours of sleep. Then after it loads you will be at your destination. Good stuff.<br /><br />Thats it for now. If I figure out any more lil tidbits Ill share them here with you. Have fun, it really is a great game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

One of the best gaming experiences...EVER
I am not one to buy new releases.  I always wait until they are $20 or so.  I've never paid full price for a game, until RDR.  I bought into the hype and decided I had to have this game.  Do I regret it?  Hell no!  I haven't put a ton of time into it but I have to say this game easily ranks in my top 10 and will probably climb to the number one spot.  <br /><br />There are moments in this game that will just make you laugh.  They will amaze you.  They will irritate you (like when I dismounted my horse to help a guy being chased by coyotes and my dumb horse wandered off a cliff and died).  But they are all great!  I am just in awe of the graphics.  My wife came in while I was playing and thought I was watching a movie.  She sat down and watched me play for 20 minuted while I hunted some animals and she was in awe and she couldn't give a flip about video games.<br /><br />There is so much to do in this game.  I am speaking single player strictly...I haven't played multiplayer yet.  It's fun to just ride around and do stuff.  You really get the feel of being in the old west. And if you are tired of doing stuff in the game, you can play one of the minigames.  I won $75 in a poker game this morning.  It was great (the AI is average).  <br /><br />I love the random events.  Stuff happens in this game.  I was out one night and just hunted down a treasure map and a cougar came out of nowhere and killed my horse.  I couldn't get away and couldn't get a beat on it and it killed me.  Amazing.<br /><br />You won't regret buying this game.  It's been awhile since I've had a game that has captured my interest like this one has.  I can't wait to get home and play some more.

Best Wild West Game Ever?
- Story: The characters and plot are both compelling. Even without gameplay in consideration, it's rewarding alone just to get from cutscene to cutscene.<br /><br />- Gameplay: Essentially, RDR is built on Grand Theft Auto IV's engine. As you'd expect, gunplay isn't perfect, but thankfully the engine has been polished a lot since Rockstar's last game. The sheer amount of variety ranging from minigames to treasure hunting means you'll be entertained for a long while.<br /><br />- Graphics: RDR is a beautiful game to look at. The wild west setting is depicted perfectly and feels very authentic. Texture pop-in is annoying but unnoticeable when you're sucked into the game.<br /><br />- Audio: Outstanding voice acting from a variety of characters coupled with great sound effects. The soundtrack is very basic given the setting but it serves the game well.<br /><br />- Replay Value: Rockstar has put together a massive game full of enjoyment and content. The multiplayer is fully-featured and incredibly fun to play with friends. The single-player is roughly 30 hours in length but there are tons of thing to find and unlock.<br /><br />Rating:<br />Story: 9.5<br />Gameplay: 10.0<br />Graphics: 9.0<br />Controls: 9.0<br />Sound: 9.5<br />Replay Value: 10.0<br />Overall: 9.6<br /><br />Last Thoughts:<br />Own it - This is one of the biggest releases in a long time and should be purchased by everyone regardless of tastes in games. The story is compelling and its inarguably the best game set in the Wild West ever.

Favorite Game Ever!
First off, I've never done a review on anything before, but this being probably THE BEST GAME I've ever played, I thought I'd say a few things. I loved the story, most movie scripts aren't written as well, the gameplay and graphics were equally impressive. I honestly enjoyed every second of this game, mostly because of the free-roam style. There is the option of taking a stage coach to avoid the long horse rides to the next missions, I took advantage of this once. In most games if there is a way of skipping the drive or ride to the destination, I almost always do so. With Red Dead Redemption, the ride is what I enjoyed most, although the missions were extremely enjoyable, the things you can accomplish on the way were just as fun, if not more fun. In the amazing world of RDR, you can hunt and skin a number of different wild animals including deer, rabbits, bobcats, grizzly bears, armadillos, a number of different types of birds and much more, all depending on the area you're in. I often found myself forgetting about the next objective and just hunting down as many animals as I could find lol. There is even a store you can sell the skins, meat and the other things you cut off or out of the animals you've hunted. <br /><br />The missions are very entertaining and original, I enjoyed every single one. In RDR it's not all about shootin' and killin' the bad guys. Though it is that, among other things, throughout the game you're asked to help#most of which you can choose not to# simple farmers and civilians, which is equally as fun as the killin'. These objectives vary from domesticating horses to capturing prisoners who've escaped their transporter, which you can choose to kill or hog-tie and return to the lawman. The actual objectives needed to progress in the game are unique in their own right, they depend on the character from whom they were given. About half of the time you'll be asked to kill so-and-so, which usually isn't alone. But the other half consists of aiding in escapes, blowing up convoys of enemy wagons and other important events. No matter what you find yourself involved in, I promise you will have fun with it. <br /><br />And if you're not interested in any missions, hunting or doing simple favors, you can go have a shot at the bar, play poker, black jack, horse shoes, five finger fillet or arm wrestle. I'm sure I'm missing a lot of things with this review, that said, the possibilities are endless. I give this game 10/10, if you've enjoyed the GTA's, COD's, MOH's, basically any first or 3rd person shooter's, or anything with a story, this game blows everything out of the water in my opinion. It's definitely worth buying, but if you're not wanting to spend $60 on a game, it's more than worth a rent and any late fee's you might accumulate when you lose yourself in this one. Hope this helps and I didn't sound too dorky, take care guys.<br /><br />P.S.mom's account, not Roberta so it wasn't some lady that gave this review, I'm 21 and a dude so...I hope that makes it more credible. <br /><br />

People think it's cool to go against the grain
"Red Dead Redemption" is a fantastic video game, and any bashers out there know it.  Either they hate that they like it, or they like that they hate it.  I preordered it and I'm telling you, it's worth every penny brand new.  If you enjoy third person "sandbox" type games, then do not hesitate to go out and get this; you won't regret it.  The game has the best open world graphics to date.  The controls, on foot and off, are perfect, coupled with the most realistic character and animal (namely the horses) movements and animations to date in a third person action/adventure game.  It's a sublime game engine in a classic setting and time period, and as much a joy to play as it is to look at.  Buy it now!

A Must Have
I was quite excited when I got this game at the midnight release and I've been playing it a great deal since. I realize this game just came out but I feel that I have enough experience to review the game. Obviously if people waited to review this game after they beat it, we would be waiting a long time. <br /><br />To sum it up, this game is incredibly fun. From duels, to hunting wanted criminals, to taking a nightshift watch in a local town, the choice of taking criminals dead or alive, the ability to shoot them in the knee... watching them crawl and grasp for their life then sauntering up to them and blowing their brains out with a special finishing move that is unique to each gun, to even unlocking outfits that each produce a special ability. And of course the Dead Eye, taking out multiple targets in slow mo is riveting, especially while on a horse. You can even play poker, gamble, and basically just whatever the heck you want. The morality system is also excellent, the choices and decisions you make will have an everlasting impact. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />I do agree that the controls take some getting used to, but definitely dont take away from the game. So far the plot line is keeping me hooked and the beautiful graphics are just pure eye candy to look at. I will be honest and say that I have not tried the multiplayer yet.<br /><br />Obviously I cant give you an in depth review of the game because that would fill 10 pages easy. I have summed up the main points and my opinion of the game so far. I hope this has helped.

Finally!  The best Western game yet created.
I became a Western game fan with Lucasarts <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K50Z">Outlaws</a> all those years ago.  Played nearly every one since then, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASG9">Desperados</a>, to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ADAME">Red Dead Revolver</a>, to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009Z3I0A">Gun</a>, to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N60GV4">Call of Juarez</a> and its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RTCOWK">sequel</a>.  All of these have had their share of fun, but also a good deal of problems.  You had to really love the genre to overlook the issues.<br /><br />Red Dead Redemption, I think, changes that.  For the first time there's a Western game I don't have to make excuses for.<br /><br />I'll start with the early history of the game: Red Dead Revolver.  As with the others, it had plenty of problems, but its style and charm won me over (even after nearly breaking the controller in some of the harder duels).  The art style was great, the music was perfect, and the gameplay was, for the most part, pretty fun.  It had a couple unique mechanics, like the quick-draw mini-game that used the analog sticks to mimic the actual motion of drawing and aiming your gun, to great effect, even if some of the enemies felt cheap.  Dead Eye mode was neat.  Running around and climbing things was a bit stiff, but certainly functional.  Aiming and shooting wasn't too bad.  One of my favorite aspects was the diversity in the weapons.  Even if there wasn't a huge discernible gameplay difference between different rifles, shotguns, or pistols, I appreciated the visuals, and some of the higher level pistols were beautifully designed.  All in all, Red Dead Revolver had a lot of potential, even if it wasn't great.<br /><br />Redemption builds off that potential, but takes it leaps and bounds over the original.  If Revolver built the launch pad, Redemption has now colonized Mars.<br /><br />Rockstar San Diego has succeeded in creating what feels like a real living breathing place.  It's the sort of world where I'm perfectly content just roaming around exploring, rather than following the story.  I'd honestly have been satisfied with the open world alone, even though the story is great.  I love riding out into the wilderness and encountering new animals (there are a ton of different species, which really helps with the immersion - in other games where you see the same 10 animals it takes you out of the experience).  There are also people all over, doing their own thing.  Traveling, hunting for treasure, fighting with each other, robbing each other.  You can participate or not!  It's also a beautiful world.  Along with the animals, the appropriate plants and landscape really sell the world.  And the skies!  Really pretty skies.  And then there are the towns, also appropriately populated, and each with their own set of activities.  I enjoyed a game of poker last night (the guy I played with was a pansy, he busted out quick).  I've also been having a good time going after bounties and doing night watches at Bonnie's place.<br /><br />The action mechanics all work very well.  Shooting is genuinely fun.  I feel like a gunslinger.  The sound effects have good power to them, and the guns handle in a believable and satisfying manner.  I also really like the way Rockstar handled the way characters react to being shot.  Not only do they use rag doll physics, but they react to where they're shot.  We've seen this idea in other games before, but this is the best execution I've seen of the effect so far.  I'm really looking forward to finding some of the rare guns in the game to see how they all handle.<br /><br />Riding is pretty fun, too.  While not as simple to control as those in Gun, perhaps, the horse handle more realistically, and riding is very satisfying in its own right.  They move the right way, and I loved the little touches like the way they slide down steeper inclines.  They also spook when snakes are nearby.  The idea that you can keep one horse and build its loyalty and trust is great.  Unlike other games, where the horse function like cars that you can hop in and out of, in Redemption you're rewarded for taking care of one horse for an extended period.  I actually grew attached to mine.  There are many different breeds of horses, too, a first for games that I know of.<br /><br />And then there's the story!  The story is solid.  And interesting premise, with lots of fun characters along the way.  I must say, I really enjoyed the interactions between Marston and Bonnie.  She's a great character.  The voice acting is pretty darn good.  Definitely some of the best I've heard in games.  Marc Alaimo as Reverend Ray in Call of Juarez is still my favorite, but the voices of Marston, Bonnie, and Leigh Johnston are up there.  It's such a relief to not want to skip through every cutscene.<br /><br />I have a feeling Red Dead Redemption will be occupying a lot of my time these next few months.  I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet (some friends who were going to get the game bailed on me -- their loss!), and there are tons of challenges and side missions to complete yet.  I recommend this game not only to Western game fans, but to fans of immersive open-world gameplay done right.

Oooh snap.
Move over...everything else. This game is a new all time favorite. I'm terrible at shooters, and couldn't even figure out why I was buying this in the first place. But I felt like it was sort of 'just right' for my level. Nothing was impossibly too hard, but if it was, there is always a 'skip to next checkpoint' option so that you don't get stuck and can continue on with the story. I never used it, because it might've taken me many tries to get past a level, but I had no incentive to stop. I could not put this game down until the credits started rolling. And even after that, the online mode has still got me playing. My new all time favorite game. Buy it, you won't regret it.

I'm not even a gamer like that. I'm one of those ppl who bought my PS3 for the blu-ray to give you an idea, & I bought a few games initially (FIFA 10, Modern Warfare 2) which held my attention, but nothing like this. <br /><br />With the tutorials, it shouldn't be hard for someone who hasn't gamed in years to get a pretty decent grasp on how to play. <br /><br />There have been some frustrations w/some of the challenges (lasso the horse, anyone??) but nothing that took me out the game.

Single player is amazing.
I'll try to keep this short and sweet.  Let's start by addressing the technical issues:  yes, there is pop-in, occasional slow-down, and the random odd glitch, but has there ever been a Rockstar game for which this wasn't the case?  And, more importantly, these things don't detract from the experience at all, at least not for me.<br /><br />The world is much better realized than in GTA IV, with more possible interaction with NPCs, and the random encounters are a great deal of fun.  Also, R* San Diego has 'fixed' some of the features of GTA that were always irksome, such as health (which now regenerates if you avoid further injury), failing missions (which now offers you a 'Restart from checkpoint' option that usually only puts you back a minute or so in gameplay), and the ability to replay any mission you've completed at any time through the pause menu (thank you!).  The only step backward from the GTA franchise is that your character, John Marston, dies pretty much instantly in water.  Didn't these guys ever see Butch and Sundance?  Cowboys should be able to swim.<br /><br />I haven't touched the (reportedly buggy) multiplayer yet, but with as much fun as I'm having just riding around rescuing people from bandits and trying to avoid becoming a cougar's lunch, I haven't missed it at all.<br /><br />Whether or not you'll connect with it probably comes down to your feelings about westerns and/or open world games, but I can say without hesitation that I have more fun with RDR than I did with either GTA IV or Fallout 3, both of which I thought were excellent open world experiences.

Become Clint Eastwood
Over the last five days since Red Dead Redemption arrived in the mail, I have become more and more amazed by it with each passing day. I don't think I'll ever be getting bored with it. If you like Grand Theft Auto IV and westerns, such as myself, you'll be in heaven. Even if you don't care for either of those, the story, characters, locations, and breathtaking graphics will draw almost anyone in. To top it all off, RDR features a massive environment and at least 20 hours of gameplay in single player mode. Aside from the main missions, you can play poker, hunt and skin animals, herd cattle, train horses, kill good or bad guys (depending on if you're taking the hero or outlaw route), duel some unlucky fellow, take on various side quests, or just ride around the gorgeous landscape for hours on end.<br /><br />The graphics and sound are top of the line, even with some minor visual glitches here and there. The voice acting here can't be beat. If you have played the GTA games, the controls here are pretty much the same. Riding a horse can take awhile to master, but I now ride it like a real cowboy.<br /><br />Red Dead Redemption is the best way to experience the wild west. Sure, watching a western movie has it's own rewards, but with this game you actually feel like you're a part of this time in history. This is probably one of my favorite games ever. While God of War III is still pretty great, this is the game of the year by a country mile.

If you love open play westerns, action & details (aka FALLOUT3 & OBLIVION) this is it!!! (single player game action explained)
Move over Bethesda, Rockstar has a strong contender for "GAME OF THE YEAR".  This game is as good as FALLOUT3 and OBLIVION.  The attention to details the outstanding graphics, story, acting, cut scenes all make it outstanding!!!<br /><br />This review is only about game play and the details of this BEST WESTERN saga.  All basic story etc have been discussed so lets get some meat and potaoes about "RED DEAD REDEMPTION"  (RDR).<br /><br />1.  First you get a very good detailed map of the territory (18 x 28 inches  this territory is as big if not bigger than OBLIVION.  I'd say 40 square miles of desert, mountains, monument valleyish area, Bayou swamps to Tall pines cross the river into Mexico wow this is some great beautiful stuff!!  All the cactus & sage, howling critters & singing birds. ) I use the map often (great planner especially for fast traveling).<br /><br />2 Watch the trailers and just the opening scenes makes you realize this is the first serious WESTERN video game!!!!  ROCKSTAR  BRAVO!!!  I'm truly HOME ON THE OPEN RANGE!!<br /><br />3. Basic High Lights of Single Player (Note it will take you a few sessions and a commitment to become one with this virtual world.  It is so worth it later in the storyline.  Learn and use everything!!!<br />  A.  Free Roamimg - explore, learn your environment it is alive and dangerous  This game easily will clock 100+ hours if you live in this old west environment and discover the many scores of mini quests and discoveries (mines, ghost towns, cattle drives, treasure etc.)  Traveling using all modes walking, horse, stage coach, train etc.<br />  B.

Buy, Play, and ENJOY!!! <br />

An Extraordinary Effort
I wanted to emphasize a point that at least one other reviewer made -- given the period setting for this game, it seems so much more realistic than GTA IV ever did.  Given the relative lack of law enforcement and the transient nature of the West, the "anything goes" kind of feel is there at level of saleability that I haven't seen in another game.<br /><br />I have to compliment R* for the depth of the experience and characters in the game.  While there are the expected scripted missions, all kinds of stuff just happens out of nowhere, and you are forced to make very quick judgments about what you should do.  If you see a guy being chased down by two others shooting at him, do you intervene?  You know none of the background, so who is on the good side?  Who on the bad?  Do you just watch it play out and do nothing?  There are real in-game consequences to your decisions, as measured by the honor and fame needles, and your "wanted" level.  The number and diversity of the random situations you are confronted with are truly remarkable.<br /><br />R* also did an excellent job of making the West alive with animals and diverse geography.  The hunting aspect of the game is really fun and adds to the experience.  I got killed once by a hog that seemed to have the dexterity of Lazarovich, but that was probably just me since I haven't played too far into the game.<br /><br />The level of detail in the game is also very impressive.  I was near a tree and shot an animal, and the report caused several birds I couldn't see to take flight from the tree.  I rode over a dead guy and my horse left bloody horseshoe prints.  And then there's all the stuff you would expect but are still amazed by -- the detail in the towns, shops, etc. and the way the horses ride and carriages feel to drive.<br /><br />There are some things R* could have done better, and I'll close with those.  I hesitate to call them "cons" because in a game so rich, I have to ask myself what more I am truly allowed to expect.  Regardless, here they are:  (1)  graphics could have been better in some instances -- some popping textures and inconsistent frame rates, but at the same time I am amazed that the game can keep up at all given how quickly scenery can change when your galloping along on your horse and changing direction; (2)  the weapon wheel can be a bit clumsy; (3)  some visuals could be sharper -- not sure why the game is not 1080p, but perhaps that would have required additional disc space that wasn't available given how expansive the game is; and (4)  I agree with an earlier poster that it's a bit weird for the lead character not to be able to swim.  It could have been fun to try a fight in the water with knives or something, save people from drowning (or not), do some log rolling, etc.<br /><br />All in all, I consider RDR an achievement in gaming.  The genre has so much appeal to kids, I would thing R* would do well to have a scaled-down "E" or "T" version that focused just on hunting, treasure, and gathering quests.  My kids would love it.  They are clamoring to play/watch RDR, but there is just so much inappropriate content for kids in the game that, regrettably, there's no way to parse out any activities in the game for them.  If they made an "E" or "T" version, they could sell several million additional copies, IMO.

Hours of fun and enjoyment
This game is great.  I decided to play the game before i had to go to bed to get up for work in the morning.  I never went to bed.  What seemed like 45 minutes was 6 hours.  <br />Realistic characters with AMAZING voice dubs make this game great.  That and all the Shooting birds, wolfs, skunks, raccoons, and every other Biotic factor in the environment.  Every single animal, besides humans of course, you can skin.  The motion when you shoot a unlucky fellow is so real.  Guns look real, and the characters are believable and legit.  Online play is amazing.  Free roam is one of my favorite features.  You can basically play the game with no penalties towards your story mode.  Yup, that means shooting cops is what gets you that boost to awake in the morning, this mode is for YOU.  <br /><br />The controls do take some time to get used to.  It took me a few hours of playing before i can play with no hand mistakes.  This games controls is much like Grand Theft Auto.  <br /><br />Replay value in my opinion for all games is needed.  Company's don't want to make a game you play for a few hours than return it.  This game has great replay value.  You can be a good or bad person in this game, Infamous ring any bells?  It should.  The situations are much like the ones in Infamous, "Kill the guy and take the house, or pay $200 and receive "Honor"?  That decision is up to YOU.  <br /><br />The game graphics isn't anything amazing.  Its no Final Fantasy.  The game runs a 720p resolution.  Nuff' said.<br /><br /><br />The Verdict<br />BUY THIS GAME NOW. <br />YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.<br />GO, CLICK THE ADD TO CART BUTTON.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Red Dead Redemption
So, I just booted up the game, got through the introduction, and was finally free roaming. All of a sudden, this woman (Ok, more like a... you know. Whore) comes up to me and says, "Hey I need a ride!" Something like that, I don't remember the exact words. So I slowed down. Why not, right? It was a bad idea. She throws me off the horse and runs off with my trusty steed. I stood there, too shocked to retaliate. This is Red Dead Redemption.<br /><br />I've been playing this game for about 5 hours now and I think that I've played enough to give a review to convince people to buy this game if they have not done so already.<br /><br />First let's talk about the characters (generally, not specifically). All of the characters in this game seem to come alive as you go on quests along with them, talk to them, etc. The voice acting is great, and sometimes appropriately exaggerated for the more comedic characters. This is important because whenever you go on missions/quests in a group, there is dialogue. Almost continuous dialogue that is perfectly timed so that it ends when you reach your destination. There is constant communication between every character and it sucks you in and makes you care about all of them. There is one point in the game (I won't ruin it for you) where you are just calmly riding back with a friend and it turns into an all out rush to save the day. And that was in just the first couple of hours into the game! The voice acting is also coupled with great body and facial expressions to bring characters alive.<br /><br />(Story)<br />Well, right now the story's all over the place because I haven't been focusing on the main story line... Oops. There are just so many other things to do, other people to help, it's impossible for me to focus on one thing. The game, is HUGE. No doubt about that. The games main story line is basically John Marston (you) going out to try and kill this other guy who shot you and left you for dead. It's in the commercials/trailers. I'll probably update this later on.<br /><br />Next is gameplay. I'll break this part up.<br />(Guns)<br />Aiming is assisted so that gunplay goes smoothly, sometimes a bit too easily. The reticle is just a small dot on the screen though, so without the aim assist it would be pretty hard to hit your target. The gun controls are pretty simple. You hold down L2 to aim and press R2 to fire. O to reload (with your weapon drawn). To switch between weapons it is like Assassin's Creed 2. You hold down L1 and a circular menu pops up and you use the right analog to choose your weapon. Easy. It reads a lot harder than it actually is. You can also take cover behind rocks, hay, fences, etc by pressing R1. If you aim while in cover then John will peek out with his gun and you can take out enemies like that. Going from cover to cover and slowly gaining ground in a firefight is extremely satisfying and very intense.<br /><br />(Dead Eye)<br />Dead Eye gets its own section because it's sweet. At first it just slows down time, but later you can mark your targets by just passing over them with your reticle then pressing R2. Then you let off a succession of quick shots and take down pretty much all of them depending on where you placed your shots. And then there are duels. The duels are pretty entertaining but so far a bit too easy. You basically face off in the famous western standoff and whoever can mark the opponent faster (like in Dead Eye mode) wins. One time, I accidentally called my horse over to where I was before I accepted the challenge... So the horse got in my way during the duel and I accidentally killed him. Sad. I have yet to find a good replacement.<br /><br />(Horses)<br />Great Animation. Good transportation. Breaking wild mustangs is fun. Dragging people behind you with a lasso = fun. Carrying your victim on the back of the horse while they say things like, "I'm worth more to you free than captured," is great. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />(The Lasso)<br />Once I finally got the lasso I pretty much hogtied everyone in sight. You can also hogtie enemies and slap them onto the back of your horse to collect rewards. It's great. Using the lasso while on the horse can be a little annoying at first but you get used to it. Riding along a dusty trail and coming across a herd of wild horses is terrific once you've got the lasso. I haven't figured out what color horse is faster than the other but I've tried them all out and the one I killed, which is one you get through the story, is the best. And he was a white one.<br /><br />(Controls)<br />They can be a bit "eh" but seriously, does not blemish the game at all. It'll take a bit of getting used to but once you do you'll be on your way to becoming either a famous hero or an infamous outlaw.<br /><br />(Honor/Fame System)<br />Don't expect to get famous fast. My honor meter is much higher than my fame one. Which just means that I'm a bit famous for being a good guy, instead of being a bit famous for being evil. I have yet to perform too many evil acts, besides killing my horse on accident which cost me -50 honor points. So, I can't really say anything about this yet. I'll probably update this later on.<br /><br />If you read all of this you're probably interested in this game. Buy it! You won't regret it. It is the greatest western gaming experience I've ever had. There is a LOT to this game, so if I forgot something (which I probably did), whatever. It's not like I've finished the game anyway. Just buy it and enjoy it!

Rockstar have done it again!
I've heard people say RDR is a GTA clone.  Though the game play is similar it's a good thing.  The missions are interesting and fun.  The mini games and challenges provide hours of fun outside of the story mode.  The hunting alone keeps me occupied for hours.  Then there's the poker, blackjack, liar's dice, five finger fillet, horse shoes, breaking horses and treasure hunting.  The honor and fame systems give it a kind of "RPG" feel though you don't "level up" but it definitely impacts how people react to you later in the game.  I love the random encounters and the other various side missions.  Did I mention the hunting?  Deer, buck, goats, big horn sheep, elk, buffalo, armadillos, coyotes, rabbits, foxes, wolves, grizzlies, eagles, hawks, vultures, crows, songbirds, bobcats and cougars.  Those are just the ones I've come across and I'm only about 50% through the game.  Every one of those animals can be "skinned" except for the birds whose feathers you can collect and turn their meat, hides, claws, horns, pelts and/or antlers in for money at general stores and/or gunsmith shops.  You can also loot people's bodies for money and you can collect their dropped weapons and ammo.  If you're not the kind of person that likes to complete a game to 100%, then this game may not be one of your favorites.  I personally love collectibles and side missions to distract me while I'm bored with the main story line.  Which is why I also loved Fallout 3.  I am looking very much forward to DLC for this game.  My only wish is that DLC would add more area to the map to explore further.  However, the map as it is now is HUGE.  I ran from the far bottom left corner of the map to the far upper right corner on a fast horse and it took me close to 10 - 15 minutes...but that's with stopping to skin a deer or two and stop to help a few folks who yelled for it.  <br /><br />In short...if you love open-world games with plenty more to do other than the main story line, GET THIS GAME!  Rockstar does it again!

Return to the Old West: A Casual Gamer's Review
The last great game that I played on my PS3 was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E8VB6O">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>. In fact, thinking about it I still smile a bit. I loved every minute of the adventure, and still recall climbing to the top of the clock tower, leaping off, and seeing how long I could soar. I didn't think that another game could come close to this adventure, but it turns out, I was wrong. I'm enjoying "Red Dead Redemption" just as much as Batman; for the graphic quality the shear adventure of the game, the ability to roam, the mini-games, and the total submersion of life in a Western town.<br /><br />The first time you get a chance to head out into the wilderness, you'll be impressed with the high quality realism of the game. Animals roam freely and are ripe for the hunting, but be careful of some angrier animals. I've been attacked by a cougar (and survived the tale) but didn't after a wolf pack attack. The missions John goes on are of the usual caliber, but they are fun, if not a bit repetitive. The bounty hunting pays a good price, especially if you get to lasso the criminal and hogtie him to carry him back alive.  You can play a variety of western games , my favorite is poker where, with the right clothes, you get to cheat.<br /><br />Overall, I found this game to be very easy to use. The design of the game is very intuitive, and you don't have to learn a bunch of fancy button moves to make things happen. Most importantly, it's just a lot of fun to slip into the old west for a hour a day, and ride my horse into the sunset, or rope a wild horse, or even chat it up with the saloon ladies.

I'M A COWBOY! Wooo-Whoooo!!!
I'm picky about my games. I've loved Unchartered 2, Batman, and Assasins's Creed 2. Not cared much for Little Big Planet, Grid and others. <br /><br />Red Dead is a ton of fun. Lot's of things to have fun with in this sandbox. Looks fantastic, gameplay is always fun. I'm about 10 hrs into the game, and I'm learning new ways to get things done. Great shooting with Red Eye, running and flying real critters to kill and skin.<br /><br />I'M A COWBOY! Wooo-Whoooo!!!

Red Dead Redemption - A masterpiece not to be missed
Red Dead Redemption is the game that finally does the western it's well deserved justice. The missions are varied, the characters awesomely crafted, the story is great and everything comes together as the best Sandbox ever. Since I opened my copy of Red Dead Redemption - I learned that this is a single player game that keeps on giving, is as good as if not better than Grand Theft Auto IV and is as beautiful as a Hollywood epic. An unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. This is certainly one of those moments in time when PS3 like myself owners will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars. Excellent gunfights, strong characters and plenty of room for expansion makes Red Dead Redemption one of the best games of 2010 in my opinion.<br /><br />

Red Dead On
Red Dead Redemption is simply one of the best games I've ever played for the new generation of console games. This is easily the best western game ever produced, and Rockstar has done an outstanding job. One thing I noticed is that the game feels a lot like Grand Theft Auto IV as far as controls are concerned. This is a boon, considering that a large portion of the gaming community will instantly be familiar with motions.<br /><br />There is so much to do and explore in this world. It's value for replayability is great! I've noticed some negative reviews, BUT I have yet to see any valid reasons why this is not a good game (unless it's style/genre isn't your cup of tea). It has an interesting narrative, hours and hours of playtime, good graphics, great details and lots of fun things aside from the main plot. It may handle like GTA IV, but button control does not make it the same game. A point of gripe seemed to be other games have had better graphics. This game is massive and to expect highly polished graphics is unrealistic.<br /><br />So if you don't like this game, snap into a slim jim and get back to playing Ratchet & Clank.

Blows GTA4 off the planet
Ive had the game for about 5 days. And let me tell you its been a fun week! There is just so much to do. You might be on your horse to go to a set waypoint but you'll always get sidetracked. I mean in a good way. Animals to kill and skin. Strangers to help if you want to. The game is mindblowing! Ive played GTA Vice City, San Andreas,Manhunt 1,Gta4/Lost and the Damned. But there is something a lot more fun with Red Dead. Ive put in about 10 hours and I have't even scratched the surface. And the missions are fun and not too hard..yet. Gameplay is solid. Some folks have complained about the horse riding but I dont know what they're talking about. And John is a cool character to play. He doesnt say too much but who cares. The game reminds me of San Andreas because the amount of activties and side missins are eveywhere.I guess Uncharted 2 was maybe a bit better but not by much! There are some crazy things that happen at random. Once you hitch up a horse you can keep him. One funny thing happened to me. There I was just walking on foot exploring,came upon a beautiful canyon overlooking this huge desert vista,then I thought well I need my horse. I whistled,thats how you get your horse,he came came running towards all magestic<br />and cool looking. But he was running so fast that he flew past me and leaped off the edge of the cliff!And I think I screamed outloud "NNOOOOOOOO">>,,I couldnt beleive it!. He just fell to his death..LOL..oh well life in the wild west is tough. Just go buy it now!

A Must Have Game.
How do you describe a game that seems to keep getting better as you play? Example: I had just gained a new horse (it's a given horse, but still) , a pretty cream colored one and I was just trotting along wonder what I should try out next. Visit Bonnie? Maybe she'll show me some new rancher chores. Maybe help the Marshall round up some criminals and help move my own story along. Maybe I should visit the random question mark on my map? Find out what's that all about. All the sudden a woman is crying for help. I get off my horse to check it out. A pack of wolves is chasing her. I go to help kill the wolves when all the sudden she's gone. The wolves attack me instead. I kill them with my knife (yea I'm cool) and turn to my horse who is now missing. I call it, and it doesn't come. I just got scammed into losing my horse. I catch up with the high jackers have a quick shoot out with them and end up having my brand knew stallion killed.<br /><br />Yea, this game is to say, at least unpredictable.<br /><br />I haven't finished the story, but yet why do I feel the need to gush over this game? Because the story isn't what makes the game so great (So far the story is awesome though). It's the massive map and massive capability it allows. You can go hunting. Treasure hunting. You can spend hours shooting birds. You can spend hours shooting passerbys (yea I've done it). You can spend hours playing poker, horseshoes, the knife and finger game (sorry name slipped my mind). Be a hero. Be an outlaw. You can help protect the ranch or patrol the streets in a town. Who needs a story line when you can spend most of your time just running around doing your own thing? Now imagine doing all of this with your friends. Against your friends. Yea, this is what I would can an all round game. The best part, it's based in 1911. Who doesn't love a rowdy and dusty western?

Killing everything in sight!
There's no better rush than riding on your steed and shooting a man down while he runs to save his miserable life. <br /><br />Some people say the controls took time to get used to but I caught on fairly quick. The graphics are good. Nothing groundbreaking but still good.<br /><br />Hunting the animals is one of the funnest thing to do in the game. <br /><br />I've only gotten like 2 hours into the game but let me tell you it's great and I imagine it'll only get better.

The Wii Remote (Not a Kid)
Since the console has been covered in other reviews, this one will be a little more in-depth about the controller, and only the controller.  I hope it can convince you, because it certainly enhanced my gaming experience.<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />Wow.  That's all I had to say after plugging the Wii in at my home on November 19th.  After months of waiting, it is finally here, and for once, this game system actually met and possibly exceeded my expectations.  Know before continuing that I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, I hated the Gamecube, own a PS2 and will be buying an Xbox 360.  Well, after buying this, I don't know if i will be needing that 360.<br /><br />The biggest thing about the Wii is it's new controller.  Instead of the traditional two-handed gamepad with 2-4 buttons and some analog sticks, the Wii's input system is shaped like a TV remote control.  It has a couple of buttons on it, but not nearly as many as the average controller.  How can you play complex games with such a simple controller?  The answer is motion control.<br /><br />The Wii's controller has accelerometers inside of it, allowing it to sense when you wave, swing, punch, stab, or shake.  It can also interact with a sensor bar placed on top of the television to make a pointer for the TV.  For example, to select a menu option, you just point at the option with the remote and click the A button.  This creates a whole new gaming experience.  It's like one of those arcade games at the local mall, but it works better, and no more 25 cents per turn!<br /><br />The remote is also very comfortable.  For games that would need two analog sticks, such as shooters, there is a connectable perephial with an analog stick and two shoulder buttons, which is called the Nunchuk.  In a shooting game, this would handle movement and the remote would handle the aiming.  It takes a very short amount of time to get used to, but once you do, it is much more comfortable than the normal controller.  You can spread your hands out instead of hunched up, holding your hands together.<br /><br />The Wii Remote is functional, efficient, comfortable, and smart.  It is so much better than controllers of the past, and I hope this is a sign of things to come from Nintendo.

An Inexpensive Gaming Console for the Whole Family
The Nintendo Wii is the most inexpensive of the current generation of gaming consoles. It provides motion sensing controllers and 480p graphics. We tested the Wii before its launch day (I'm a game reviewer), and we had our own unit in our home the morning of launch day. Here are our findings.<br /><br />The Wii is designed around a menu of "channels". There is of course the game-playing channel, where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game. Simply load the disc in and go. There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing. The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV. Other channels for news, weather, and online shopping require an interent connection; the news and weather were not actually working at launch time.<br /><br />The system does NOT have a regular network cable port, which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have. Instead, it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter. I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically. With the PS3, you have to pay extra for the 60 gig unit to get this built in. The XBox 360 requires extra hardware as well.<br /><br />It's hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy. That being said, the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun and is about as basic as you can get. You swing at baseballs, lob tennis balls, bowl, box and play golf. A "fitness" mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age, sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age. If you did both every day, you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible! <br /><br />In a world where video games = couch potato, it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active. You don't lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games. Boxing can be quite strenuous, jabbing, blocking and weaving in real life. Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements. Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports, but even there you are standing, moving, swinging. You get your heart going at least a little, and get some exercise. My boyfriend had a sore arm after playing for a number of hours, in a good way, as he would from exercising.<br /><br />The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like the other two systems. It's something you accept when you're paying such a low price for the console. But really, it's not that big a deal. I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay, even though you can't see the pores in Link's face. If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments, 480p is DVD quality and is quite good. If you really, really crave high definition super realism in your games, then the Wii might not be the best choice for you. However, if you're fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them, the 480p can show that quite nicely. For example, there aren't fans in the stands for baseball - there are colored blocks.<br /><br />Nintendo has always been known as a "Kid's Console" - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a "Family Console". It's not just kids who will enjoy this. Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything "Tricky" about how to use a video game unit. It's very intuitive. Moms can easily play with their kids, each with their own Wii profile. Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around. Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine. Every person who has come over - from 8 to adult - has instantly understood and enjoyed the Wii, without much explanation at all.<br /><br />With the price tag being so low, a gaming household that "needs" a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify to get a Wii for the fun, casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends.<br /><br />Well recommended! Since I own all three systems, and am playing all three wirelessly, feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.<br /><br />================<br /><br />Update: One year later, and the Wii is still going strong! It's really funny how many people said the Wii would bomb because it wasn't as good as the PS3 or 360 - and here we are a year later and the Wii is still the system that people are really wanting to get. Hospitals are getting Wiis for their patients to play with. Senior centers are getting Wiis for their residents to play games together with. I was just on a cruise ship and they had Wii tournaments going on every day! This is a fantastically fun system that we really enjoy playing with and that literally the whole family can have fun with. There are great games for kids, great games for teenagers, great games for adults. I am really very pleased with how the Wii has held up and the game set available for it.<br /><br />Update 2: 2 years later! Our Wii is still adored in our household, used just as much as the PS3 and XBox 360. I was just at a bar and they had two Wiis set up for people to play with, and everybody loved them. This really is an "every person's gaming system".<br /><br />I'm running out of space here, but my nintendo.bellaonline.com site has full articles on exactly what you get in this box, and what else you should buy so you have a full system to play with.

Wii Puts "We" Back Into Family Gaming
The true battle of the gaming consoles began months before last Christmas. Beginning about October, and definitely by Black Thursday - the Friday shopping day after Thanksgiving, television, newspapers, and every advertising medium were filled with articles and advertisements for the new gaming consoles coming out just in time to put under the Christmas tree.<br /><br />The gaming console picked to attract the most attention immediately was the PlayStation 3.  It touted the Blu-ray player that was part of the standard equipment, and that Blu-ray player was supposed to be the feature that crushed all other game consoles. Unfortunately, the PlayStation 3 - like its predecessor and the original Xbox and Xbox 360 - was underproduced. Supposedly the problem was in the blue diode chip that enabled the Blu-ray player to work. As a result, there were simply not enough PlayStation 3 units produced to fill every Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Xbox 360 came out the Christmas before. It, too, was underproduced and ended up inspiring a whole new generation of campers that took up the sport outside Walmart, Costco's, and other electronic outlet stores around the United States. The price tag of the PlayStation 3 was exorbitant, as was that of the 360 when it first broke.<br /><br />But the same time Nintendo released its new game system called simply Wii. At $250.00 per unit, buying a Wii seemed like a no-brainer, except that people were getting wooed in by the wowser graphics offered by the PlayStation 3. But the lack of PlayStation 3 units caused a run on the Wii at Christmas that has taken months to level off.<br /><br />I had been looking for a Wii since before Christmas and finally scored one at a Best Buy in May. My eighteen-year-old and I had been diligently calling the local retail stores trying to nail one down. We even called in favors from some of his friends who worked at those places to find out about incoming shipments. The problem was, those incoming units generally disappeared as soon as they hit the floor.  No one would hold one back. And you couldn't buy one over the Internet. Not even from Amazon.<br /><br />We got up bright and early on a Sunday morning and hauled butt down to the local Best Buy to grab a unit seconds after it was put out. My wife thought we were crazy. My son and I thought we were mission to rescue the Holy Grail. My nine-year-old came with us.  It was his first time for such foolishness and he had a blast. After we got the unit, we hit the game shelves. Everybody got something.<br /><br />Of course, Dad got the bill.<br /><br />At home, we hooked the unit up to the 42-inch television in the living room and proceeded to play. The games were broken out and passed around. Then we chose up lots to see who got to play first. Everybody got to play for a little while. Even when we weren't playing our games, we all sat around watching everyone else play their game. Of course, we made comments on the player's form. Unfriendly comments that beggared gross retribution when our own time came to play.<br /><br />Admittedly, I felt like an idiot waving the controller around. If someone had been looking through the window, I feel certain that the onlooker would have believed he was tuned into Discovery Channel and was watching a presentation involving tribal rituals and the sacrifice of small animals. There's just no way to look cool while playing a Wii.<br /><br />The controller is incredibly easy to use. All the new games made for the Wii are already coded to respond to the wireless controller's motions. Button use is even at a minimum so you don't get the sore thumbs you normally get with console systems. Whatever the programming is that allows the motion sensitivity to work with the games is amazing. In addition to the primary wireless controller, there's also another wireless controller that plugs into it called the nunchuk. Using different configurations of these two devices allows for many permutations of movements.<br /><br />Since we got the Wii right at the end of school, we had time to play on the weekends and often used it as a stress reliever in the evenings.  For the first time a long time, we were all gathered around the television and a gaming console. Over the years we've played board games and card games, but there is nothing like playing video games together or providing moral support during a hard-fought campaign. Every victory is celebrated together, and every defeat is never alone.<br /><br />The Wii package we got came with a collection of sports games. The collection includes boxing, golf, bowling, tennis, and baseball. We had more fun, and more laughs, playing those games together than we did playing our individual games with support.<br /><br />I fault the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 for not making more family-oriented games. They just don't bring families together the way Nintendo games always have. Of course, I have to give it up to the graphics that are available on those two games systems. Nothing short of a PC matches up to them.<br /><br />But the bottom line is while the 360 and the PlayStation 3 look beautiful, they just don't put families together the way the Wii does. Not only is the price tag significantly cheaper, but if you're a family that loves to play games together, the Wii is the best way to go because there are more multi-player games that are age-friendly from parent to child.<br />

Living up to the Hype
By the time I was able to locate and purchase a Wii, I had read various reviews of the new console. Needless to say, the consumer reaction had my expectations set pretty high. I quickly found that the Remote and Wii combo fully lives up to everythig that I have read.<br /><br />I bought the Wii at a retail location with Zelda: Twilight Princess. I opened the box and 4 easy steps later, was up and running. Even on my old 27 inch CRT with the factory supplied RCA cables, the Wii menu was crisp and impressive. My Wii remote instantly and accurately displayed a pointer that seemed a little sensitive at first, but quickly became easy to control with only slightly smaller, and slower movements. I created a Mii: a fun little extra with lots of customization available. In seven minutes or so I had created Miis for me and my girlfriend that were actually pretty decent caricatures of ourselves. Torturing myself, I left Zelda in the package and popped in the game that comes with the console, Wii Sports.<br /><br />The Wii Sports games are very basic. Tennis requires no button pressing at all, and you don't move your Mii character to the ball, the computer does that for you. Despite the limitations, you can control the hardness and directionality of your shot by simply altering your stroke hardness and timing with the Remote. Baseball is also rather simple. It is more like a homerun derby mixed with one-on-one baseball you might play in the backyard with ghost runners and ghost fielders (based on your hit, the batter is declared out or is given a single, double, triple, or homerun, depending on how long it took for the ball to be fielded by the AI controlled fielders). Human players only control pitching and hitting, but the Wii Remote operates flawlessly. I was even able to place my hit like real baseball, hitting it down either line or up the middle. After a few innings I hit my first couple homeruns and moved on to the next game. Bowling is as simple as real-life bowling. You can line up your Mii and put as much or as little hook on the ball as you want by simply twisting the Remote in the corresponding direction. I bowled the best ten frames of my life on my very first round. Golf is a little more difficult. If you swing too hard, you will shank the ball pretty badly, and not in a predictable manner. It doesn't help matters that if a ball lands in the rough, your max shot power is reduced by half and there is no chance of reaching the green in two shots on a par 4. The Mii on-screen does not always match your back stroke accurately. Luckily, the on-screen backstroke doesn't seem to affect how well you hit the ball when you swing forward. Putting and chipping are all touch. If you have shot at least four or five rounds of golf in your life, you can just look at how far away the hole is on the TV and swing accordingly. You can read the greens just by looking at them and adjust your aim to correspond to the slope. The ball responds pretty true-to-life and it is very easy to find yourself overshooting the green or putting way past the hole. This is not a fault with the Wii, however, it is a reflection of the difficulty of the real game of golf. The final game on the Wii Sports disc is boxing. Not quite Fight Night, but still rather fun; Wii sports boxing will warm you up. You can float like a butterfly, though your feet don't control anything on the screen. Your gloves on screen mimic where your hands, equipped with the remote and nunchuck, are in real-life. You can bring your hands to your face and block and then dodge left and right. If you are trying to do a punch other than a jab, it requires a pretty specific motion of either the remote or the nunchuck (just uppercutting the air will not necessarily perform an uppercut on-screen; you have to exagerrate the motion quite a bit to see results), and don't expect to be able to execute lightning-fast combos, at least not until fight night or a new rocky game is released. Overall, the sports games are more teasers than anything else. They show the true potential of the wii remote and nunchuck, especially for sports game applications. I can't wait to see some of the old sports favorites adapted to the new control scheme. The potential is there and Wii Sports hilights this potential while offering replayable games that are still fun and intuitive. My girlfriend, who will only play zelda games, was up jumping around, boxing and nearly falling over returning tennis serves within ten minutes of setting up the console.<br /><br />Zelda is beautiful so far, but I haven't really acquired enough items to make any firm determinations. I did, however immediately go out and buy Red Steel, which I have to say is great as well. It took a few levels to truly get the aim down and adjust to the sensitivity, even though I am still occasionally forgetting that the remote controls looking and letting the pointer wander off of the screen. The graphics are great and the control is fantastic after a little practice.<br /><br />Considering the high price tag and extremely limited availability of the other next-generation consoles, I definitely prefer the Wii. Graphics will continue to get better and better until reaching a level of near reality, but what then? Nintendo has taken the first big step in radically changing the way that users interact with the digital world and I glady forfeit some minute details and crispness in the graphics for the brand new control scheme. So long controllers with 15 buttons and counterintuitive, "press this button to do this," memorization-required control schemes and hello pick-it-up and play, get-off-the-couch controls of the future.

Amazing
Just picked this up during the midnight launch at Wal-mart, so far it's 3:45AM PST and I have to say that I'm totally impressed by Nintendo's latest effort though at first the new control may feel foreign after not more than just a few minutes it feels natural incredibly fun and after a little bit you'll never feel like going back to a regular controller again. I asked my cousin who was w/ me during the launch if he'd get a Wii and he said "no", but that all changed as we hooked it up and started playing Wii sports. All of a sudden it went from "no" to "what games are there" etc. Try this and I guarauntee(*sp) that you will be impressed by this revolutionary new system that places gameplay above nice shiny eye candy which unless you've been living under a rock should know by now that that's not what the Wii's all about. I just also wanted to add that I'm not just some Nintendo fanboy trying to butter this system up as I also own a 360 and also plan on owning a PS3 when the right games come out for it, pure and simple I am a gamer and don't care for one particular system over another as long as it has the games to back it up. For those that are skeptical stop doubting this is the real deal and at a price ($250) that can't be beat by any of Nintendo's competitors this is something that will entertain the entire family regardless of age, gender etc. For about $350 I picked up an extra controller set(wii remote and nunchaku)and a copy of Zelda (try getting anywhere near that much w/ any other system). I'll admit that when Nintendo had finally shared its strategy to the world a while back I was skeptical as well until I saw the videos for it and knew from than on that Nintendo was truly onto something great. Another cool note is that if you have a Gamecube controller lying around you can actually use that for playing the library of old school games that come from the Wii shop (which can be purchased w/ Wii points)instead having to go out and buy the new Wii retro controller (nice touch) some old school games can also simply be played w/ the remote.  Also unlike the almighty Microsoft point the Wii points are on equal terms w/ the dollar so 100 Wii points equals $1 etc. You can purchase those online in the Wii shop by 1000 point increments(I believe) up to 5000 points. Prices for NES games are 500 points 800 points for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo games and 1000 points for N64 games. Right now though the library is fairly limited  offering no more than a few titles (no more than 5)for each console. The bottomline though is don't miss out on this revolutionary product it is definately worth at least a try before you dismiss it as a clever gimmick and is truly one of the best systems to come out in years(IMO) and a breath of fresh air to the staleness which are controllers.<br />Additional features include Wi-fi for wireless connection, 4 Gamecube control ports, 2 USB ports, 2 Gamecube memory card slots and extra slots for SD flash cards (doesn't accept anything else like Memorysticks) so you  can view your pictures on the Wii for instance.

Wii is for We
Ok, you've seen the advertisements. You've looked at the Xbox 360 and the PS3. Now, you are wondering how the least expensive next gen game console compares to its more expensive competition. Nintendo's Wii not only performs well, it exceeded all of my expectations as far as being a fun game machine.<br /><br />The Wii is actually a lot smaller than I expected...much smaller than the PS3 or the Xbox 360, and I might add, a lot lighter too. How powerful can such a little game machine be? The answer to this question can be described by what happened on the first day of playing with the Wii...everyone in my household wanted to play with it. This is saying quite a bit as the other members in my family don't play games. I started out with the included game disk called Wii Sports and tried out the bowling game. After a few minutes of play, everyone wanted to try it. Next  came the tennis game, the golf game, and boxing game. To put it mildly, the Wii was a hit at my house. <br /><br />Somehow, Nintendo has decided to not buckle under the pressure of trying to produce a new game machine on steroids that will cost you almost a month's house mortgage payment. What they have elected to do is to provide a game machine that has good graphics, fun game play, and a game console that will not just cater to hard core game people, but will offer everyone else, a game machine that is entertaining, fun to use, and non-threatening. And even if you happen to be a hard core gamer, the Wii should offer you excellent game play too.<br /><br />The Wii is the surprise of the year. If you are looking for an affordable and fun game console that the whole family can enjoy, try out the Wii, because it really is for "we."

Will change how people think about video games
I've had my Wii for 24 hours now, and my first impressions are that this system is going to revolutionize video gaming.  There are a few things that make the Wii worth buying more so than the XBox 360 or Playstation 3:<br /><br />-Better value - $[...], comes with a game and a built-in "memory card"<br />-Better controllers - The Wii remote and nunchuck are a bit pricey, but they are by far the most comfortable, accurate, and intuitive controllers I've ever used.<br />-Potential for on-line services - The virtual console games are a bit pricey right now, but the potential for Wii channels to grow into something awesome is definitely there.  The Wii is the first console I know of that shipped with a built-in set of on-line services, several of which were active the day of release<br /><br />Now, for the review:<br />The Wii hardware is small, sleek, stylish, and attractive.  It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, but compact and durable.<br /><br />The operating system of the Wii is intuitive, clean, and moves pretty quickly.  The wireless configuration is easy for anyone familiar with wireless networking.  I had it connected to my secured wireless router in just a few minutes.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how cool the Wii remote is as a controller.  Not only is it innovative, and provides whole new ways to think about controlling video games like Wii Sports, it's also a much more comfortable controller to use for traditional games like Zelda.  Being able to sit with your shoulders spread and your arms at your sides is a new freedom of movement that I never knew I needed while playing a video game.<br /><br />Wii sports is also more fun than I expected.  Although the interface and games are simple, they are also entertaining.  The tennis and golf games borrow a bit of their look and feel from Mario Tennis and Mario Golf, both pretty solid "fun-sports" titles.  The bowling game is also particularly fun, especially when played with a friend.<br /><br />Overall, I don't miss having the enhanced graphics of the PS3 or XBox 360 even a little bit.  The games I've played are fun and engaging, the new controller is going to change the world, and the on-line "Wii Channels" show a lot of promise.  <br /><br />I'm really happy I bought this system, and if Nintendo keeps delivering at this level of quality, I don't think I'm going to need any other game systems any time soon.<br /><br />~Chris<br /><br />

Clean design, Great gameplay, Lots of potential growth!
I have to say first off that I am professor that teaches digital media at SMWC.edu (look it up if you want), it wasnt going to be long before I had to pick up the next gen consoles and start really looking at them physically for next semesters classes on interactive design.  Ive read the stats for months now, know the pros and cons of all of them, can talk long winded hours on each of them.  They all have their strengths.  However, standing here, in my living room, roughly 3 days after hooking up the wii next to the other two next gens, and watching the reaction it gets from my friends, their kids, even their wives/husbands... its really hands down as far as which is getting more traffic.<br /><br />Now we know the graphics arguement.  But you really REALLY have to consider this thought process.... what do graphics matter if the game play is no different then it was on the past generation?  If there is no difference in response, in condition, then the development is purely surface.  A common theory is that we have entered into a stage of development where we dont create new, we simply improve upon the old.<br /><br />Wii may be an improvement on old concepts, but it is a new.  It is not simply wireless remote with tilt response.  it is a vast responsive system.  It measures speed, and angle, gyration.  its connection to the system is very tight.  I had my doubts about how responsive it would be.. I was foolish to doubt.<br /><br />Going back to graphics and game play.  The demo disc (wii sports) that was included is a good example of group play.  Bowling and golf are very strong titles, offering complex control of your tilt and curve of your remote.  In bowling, A friend of mine has a wicked slice and was able to simulate that perfectly by going through the same motions he does when he bowls.  Same story with golf.<br /><br />Tennis and Baseball is about  your swing. You dont control the physical movement of your player, done automatically, but it shows the potential.  Also your pitch is influence by your throw style as well.  <br /><br />Boxing requires the most response from the control system, and for the most part delivers.  In the heat of the fight, you tend to move less controlled, and the remote wont throw a punch unless it is a solid punch/jab, so half-a** punchs dont always register... DONT TAKE THIS the wrong way, its very minor and not often this happens.<br /><br />Again, the graphics are not PS3/360 level... but why do they need to be.  We arent talking atari 4600 or ps1 level here.  We are talking crisp graphics that even the ps2 would have balked at.  smooth lines, blurs, clean.  Its nice and eye pleasing.<br /><br />Outside the game, you can make your own avatar (mii) for you and your friends, if you have internet, you can set them to wander other systems, and in the end you can even have mii visitors.  The virtual console channel (its all set around channels) lets you buy new games from older consoles, so if you have the option, buy the classic controller (it hooks to the remote, so its wireless) too.  cost is no more then [..] per game, so enjoy the potential that is supposed to grow weekly (wait and see).  More channels like weather, news, and browser, are to be unlocked through january... here's hoping for more.<br /><br />So, if I didnt own all of them what would I do?  Buy the wii first.  BEST all around FUN machine.  The graphics are pretty, the game play is tight, and the enjoyment certainly lasted a LOT longer then it did on the others.  More then this, it fulfilled its promise, people who arent gamers were playing, laughing, and having fun.  And then they did something else, they wanted to come back and play it more.

Addicting for the whole family
Everyone can understand how to play, and everyone has fun playing... My father, who hates video games as a way of spending time and money thinks that the wii is great, and was like a little boy playing it.. (he's 55).  My mother even tried it out and enjoyed it.  The wii, when used as its intended with you getting up and swinging the remote will give you a nice bit of exercise.  in wii sports, (comes with the system), boxing tennis bowling and the various training and fitness tests that go along with the games can have you working up a sweat.  zelda is great too, for the serious gamer.  $250 is well worth the price, video games are fun again, and you can get everyone involved!

Greatness in a box
I don't own the Wii yet. I'm getting it soon, but I have played it at a friend's house for quite some time now. I'm going to avoid talking about the Mii channel and the controllers, and focus on the games.<br /><br />Wii Sports is a very interesting package. I thought it would be more of an introduction to the concepts of motion sensing and exercise. However, I was proven wrong as my friend and I were able to play Wii Sports for periods of hours at a time. My favorite of the sports is baseball. As an avid baseball fan, I really enjoyed how Nintendo created the home run derby-pitching mix. Yes, baseball on the Wii does get your arm sore after throwing hard fastballs (my highest was 93 mph), but I took it in a positive way, because the soreness reflected real life. As a pitcher, often after throwing hard my arm is sore, and I was astonished by how real Nintendo made this game.<br /><br />My second favorite Wii Sports game is tennis. Although I was somewhat dissapointed about the fact that you can't move your character (the computer does it for you), I was again astonished by the detection of the machine. My friend gave me a volley return, up by the net, and when I softly swung the controller, the ball lobbed. When I wanted to smash a ball right by him, I could swing hard, and again win the point. The point is, Nintendo outdid itself by making the velocity on the shot exactly as it is in real life, both in baseball and tennis.<br /><br />Finally, a game in which no one has mentioned yet, Madden 07. I own this game on the xBox 360 and I could not believe how much more fun this game was compared to the 360. Along with added features like the college all-star game and a fantasy draft (both of which are not on the 360), the gameplay is superb. I played my friend in a heated grudge match in the NFC Championship, I, the Packers against he, the Lions. We had conducted our fantasy drafts already, but I won't bore you with that. From kickoff, I was intrigued. I liked Eli Manning barking the signals through the Wiimote, and although many people find this annoying, I think it is quite funny. The game went down to the wire. I was winning 30-23, and he was driving down the field. We were running around the room at this point, and were completely immersed in the game. He scored a touchdown with 40 seconds left, and went for two points. On the two point conversion, I was able to spin off my man and place a power hit into Brady Quinn, the quarterback. He was able to throw the ball, and I could control my cornerback into swatting the ball away. I won, 30-29.<br /><br />The final play is an example of two things:<br /><br />First, the ability to score 30 points and control Reggie Nelson into swatting the ball away isa great example of how easy the controls are. Throwing the ball, snapping the ball, kicking the ball, it is all so easy to do. Instead of having to memorize a button to press, everything from juking to stiffarms to snapping the ball is done in an arm movement, allowing for people with bad memory to enjoy the game without the hassle of tutorials and reading the little booklet that comes with the xBox 360 games. <br /><br />Second, Nintendo was able to immerse its game-players in reality. I believe that graphics are not reality, but are just eye candy. I completely regret making the decision to buy an xBox 360 with my own money because of some stupid graphics. But the Wii was able get me lost in the game. I was running around the room actually chasing my friend like Mario Williams, and when I was Eli Manning, I called signals and threw passes. My point, the Wii is the closest thing you can get to virtual reality because you make your own movements. I have never been much of an athlete, so when I played Madden, I was able to be Eli Manning. Then I got home and cranked up Madden on the 360, and it wasn't the same. I haven't played my 360 for a week because it is impossible to go back.<br /><br />This system is actually the best thing since the invention of video games and pong. I love it. I can't wait to get my own. Please do yourself a favor and buy this. It's great for the family and great for social occasions.

The winning choice
Which one? Playstation 3? Xbox 360? Nintendo Wii????....<br /><br />This is an extremely hard question that has no definate answer. Out of the three new-generation systems which one will you purchase? First of all let me say that it really comes down to your personal preferences. What kind of game do u like? Things like that. Welllll...<br /><br />The main reasons that i would choose the Wii out of the other two are these as follows. <br /><br />1. I'm not allowed to play mature games. For the many kids out there who are not allowed, i would personally think that the ps3 and the 360 may not be the best choice. Pretty much all the games worth playing on them so far are rated M. Yes, there are a few sports game, but that alone, I believe, is not worth the 400 dollars you will have to dish out.<br /><br />2. Price: $250, this alone is a good reason. It is much cheaper than the Xbox 360 Premium Edition (the only edition worth getting). And as you guessed it completely and utterly destroys the PS3 price.<br /><br />3. Backwards Compatibility: Any Nintedo fans out there will love this. You can download games on to the wii from Nintendo systems dating all the way back to the NES. NES SNES N64 and Gamecube titles will all be available. <br /><br />4. Controllers: The next generation motion sensoring device we know as a controller. This is really something you have to try to understand. It is so simple that 4 year olds could play it. Buty yet it has enough features especially with the Nunchuck to challenge the experienced gamer. This is the biggest reason the Wii wins in my opinion. Playing=Believing<br /><br />Okay, now your wondering,"There has to be something wrong!" Well your right. Although very few and minor, here are the flaws<br /><br />Graphics: Although the graphics are awe-inspiring at 480p, they are not even close in my opinion to the graphics of the PS3 and the Xbox 360 at 1080i. But don't let this bother you as it used to me. Believe me after you play the Wii at your local game store, the last thing in your mind will be graphics. You will be to happy with gameplay. <br /><br />Closing comments:<br /><br />Do yourself a favor kids and get the Wii. You will not be dissapointed. And i used to be a doubter too. Untillll i played it. So, happy gaming until then. I hope my review has been helpful.<br /><br />Peace out

NINTENDO CREATES A REAL BREAKTHROUGH IN GAMING
I don't think it is fair to compare the Wii to the more pricey Xbox 360 or the PS 3. There is no question that the graphics in the two latter systems are superior to that of the Wii's. However, what I can tell you from my personal experience of being a Wii owner now for about 36 hours is that after 5 minutes of playing the tennis game that's part of the Wii Sports disc that's included with the console is that THE GRAPHICS REALLY DON'T MATTER! I have found that this NEW INTERACTIVE style of gaming has gotten me so involved in the game and acquiring the skills to improve my rating that the graphics just aren't a factor. This qaming system gets you involved beyond sitting in a chair holding a controller. In fact, the best way to play this tennis game is to STAND UP and pretend your controller is a tennis racket and swing your forehands and backhands just as you would if you were really playing tennis. Of course if you want to just sit there, you can but I'm telling you this game really promotes involvement and immersement like I never dreamed was possible for a video game.<br /><br />Nintendo has really created a NEW DIMENSION IN GAMING with this interactive style of play. I tried to get a PS3 on launch day and couldn't. I spoke to my 18 year old son who's an incredible gamer and he told me about what he had heard about the soon-to-be-launched Wii. I am really glad I looked into it and bought. I'm sure the other systems are great and in terms of graphics, are far more advanced than the Wii. However, I am very happy with this and I paid less for the system, extra controllers, and three extra games than I would have paid for the PS3 console alone, had I been able to get one. <br /><br />If you can, for 5 minutes, look beyond the antiquated graphics and see the Wii for what it really is; a new INTERACTIVE GAMING EXPERIENCE and appreciate it for this then you'll conclude that Nintendo has really done much more in terms of breakthrough technology than either Sony or Microsoft. Sony and Microsoft created games that access EXISTING HDTV technology. Nintendo has accomplished far more in that they have seemingly INVENTED A NEW TECHNOLOGY or at least created a gaming system that shows that Nintendo's engineers really "thought out of the box" to bring player involvement in the game to a level never before achieved.<br /><br />Also, from what I understand this system will play all previouisly released Nintendo games...remember Mario Brothers? I haven't tried it but I think that's par of the claim.

A Whole New Realm of Video Gaming
Wow.  Nintendo has finally come up with a gaming console that can be appreciated by both genders and all ages.  From middle schoolers to senior citizens, everyone can find something to love about Wii.<br /><br />Although most people will want to buy accessories such as extra controllers and new games, the Wii is great to play right out of the box.  The basic console comes with Wii Sports game (a selection of sports -- tennis, baseball, golf, and bowling) with its various skill levels and challenges; a wireless hand controller with wrist strap; a nunchuk controller; batteries; a wireless receiver, and the necessary cables to hook it up.  Most gamers will want, at a minimum, an extra handset and possibly the charger with rechargeable batteries. Because Wii Sports has so much included within the single game disk, extra games, while great to add, won't be necessary at first.<br /><br />For set-up, you'll need a space on top of your television for the slender, 9 1/2 inch long wireless bar that will pick up the movements and input from the remote controller.  You'll also need LOTS of room for arm swinging and back and forth movement (which will be unintentional, especially if you're used to playing the sports in real life.)  Don't underestimate the warnings!  Inevitably, someone playing Wii will cream a hand or knock the dog out or hit someone else in the nose.  Make sure the playing area is free of all obstacles and that everyone not playing knows to steer clear.  Even people who exercise regularly run the risk of tennis elbow and/or sore muscles.<br /><br />An extra note about Wii Sports since the game is a large part of a gamer's introduction to the medium:  the really cool part of the interface is the way the Wii senses and translates movement.  You can hook a bowling bowl and put slice on a tennis ball, all with the specific movements you use. The game has a training area that goes beyond the mere tutorial and into actual methods of doing the sports.  You can also test for your "Wii Fitness Age" once a day.<br />  <br />Although the Wii is difficult to come by at this writing, I suspect it will become more available a month or two after the holidays.  Definitely pick one up. You won't regret it.<br /><br />

Strangely appealing, more fun than should be allowed, possibly hazardous to your (friend's) health
Although Nintendo is somewhat of a household name for someone of my age (>40), I never really thought of getting myself a console. If I play games, I always played (and still do) them on a (high-end) computer. All that changed when I first saw the wii demoed shortly before christmas 2006. What intrigued me was their truly innovative game controller design (yes, boys love toys), and the way they integrated into the games (I saw demos from the wii sports series). <br /><br />So, on a whim, I decided on getting myself a wii, without really knowing what I got myself into. For even measure I threw in a second controller (I seldom play alone), and a title I seemed to recognize: Legends of Zelda. The box I purchased came with wii sports, and the second controller came with wii play. <br /><br />Please note that I have no experience with regard to other consoles, and the following is purely my experience I derived from playing with wii.<br /><br />First of all, the device is easy to set up. The console's design and manual make it clear that this is a mature product from a company that has a lot of experience creating consumer devices. You can't, for example, accidentally mix up plugs. The only thing that I did not like was the flimsy wire that connetcs the console to the sensor strip (which looks like an accident waiting to happen). Plug in power, plug in sensor strip (this was the most difficult, as I could not decide where to put it for best performance. As it turned out, I shouldn't have bothered. It works no matter where I place it), connect to TV, pair with controllers, and I was ready to go. Using the controllers is strange at first, and using them as pointing device has nowhere near the precision I have come to expect from a mouse. During set-up of the console I thought that this did not bode well for game play later on. Again, I should not have worried. Most games don't rely on the pointing abilities of the controller but on it's motion detection. A very nice feature of the controllers is the feedback (both aural and tactile) it gives at various moments (e.g. it slightly vibrates when your pointer is over a clickable button, or chimes when your console becomes active in two-player bowling). <br /><br />I tried the Sports games first. Yes, I've heard the stories. And laughed at those poor saps. And yet, it only took me a few minutes to stare sheepishly at my controller dangling from the wrist strap. I let go while bowling. It is a testament to the game that it becomes so immersive so quckly that you forget what you are doing. Going on to baseball I barely managed to dodge my friends swing. It was forceful. And executed in blissful forgetfulness that I was but a few feet away. I knew then that even though potentially harmful, this was real fun.<br /><br />The wii also comes with built-in WiFi, which was a surprise to me. It connected without any problems to an open access point, but required a little more work to connect to my secure wireless network. I have not yet tried to access the internet (save for two firmware updates that the wii performed flawlessly), but I'm delighted to see that it works.<br /><br />Something I also like in this console is their fun and friendly (and sometimes slightly over-protective) way they approach gaming. I really like the 'toy shop' atmosphere surrounding the device, which appears to be a stark contrast to the overbearing, testosterone-suffused "GAME THIS!" attitude that other consoles seem to exude (perhaps one of the reasons I never looked at other consoles). I already have that, and more, in my workstation (which it well should. That beast's graphics card alone has triple the price tag of the wii). The wii, on the other hand, is petite, white, and, strangely enough, seems to actually *look* happy. It appears to emphasize fun, not performance.<br />Accordingly, the wii's graphics are nothing much to write home about. Somehow, though, I find it strangely appealing. Even though the graphics are simplistic, it is the way the games are presented, and the way I can get immersed through it's game controllers. I'm having more fun waving that little white stick about than I've had in a long time of precisely pointing my mouse.<br /><br />All in all I am really delighted by this console. I won't play shooters on it (for that I have my computer), but the interactive sports and party games are so much fun (and a positive danger to anyone near you should you choose not to be careful) that I simply cannot resist them. I wholeheartly recommend this console to everyone. If possible, try to get a demo at your local store. Beware -- you might be hooked immediately.<br />

A game system for the WHOLE family
I'm a 40-something dad whose gaming experience can be measured in minutes -- not hours -- so you are getting a review here by a real neophyte.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Wii has definitely found a niche, and I think that niche will prove to be not just "tween," "teen," and "20-something" crowd, but the entire family.  I knew something was going on when my 11-year old had his 69-year-old grandmother doing "virtual" bowling with him and laughing hysterically.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Where do I start?  First, I like the diminutive footprint of this unit and the silence.  We replaced a Sony Playstation 2 with the Wii.  My biggest grip with the PS2 was that it sounded like a freight train...the fan was very, very noisy.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Wii hasn't tried to outmuscle the competition.  They've done something smarter: they've tried to be different.  The PS3 is big, powerful (and probably noisy), expensive, and not selling all that well at $[...]+ a pop.  In contrast, my son is perfectly satisfied with the $[...] Wii (he had to pay for it from his own savings), and I like the fact that the Wii system requires more physical interaction than just moving your thumbs.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I also like the integrated wireless capabilities of the Wii.  It took me about 3 minutes to get it connected to my home wireless network, which is an absolute world record compared to the frustration of getting other devices connected (such as my office laptop).  Nintendo did a great job of making this simple, and writing a decent manual with step-by-step instructions.  I put the MAC address into my router's list of trusted devices and within minutes - voila - we were connected.  The device downloaded a firmware update and then installed a nifty utility called "the internet channel" that lets us surf the 'net from the living room on our TV screen using the Wii.  [...].  Very cool.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We've only had the system for a couple of days and haven't explored all the features yet.  My son has had fun building little "Mii" characters (sort of like screen avatars) for himself, his pals, me, grandma, aunts and uncles, etc.  We've also watched weather forecasts and news now that it is connected to the internet, and of course, he's played games (the Sports disk that comes bundled with the Wii...and a Mario Party 8 disk).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The number of titles currently available for the Wii seem to be rather limited, but since the Wii is backward compatible with Gamecube disks, there is a library of 545 compatible games from that platform to choose from as the Wii builds up its own library. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The game controller itself is very innovative and is definitely what makes this system appealing to the over-18 crowd -- all the way up to the AARP crowd.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />One neat little feature for parents is the daily log that shows how much time has been spent doing activities.  So now when those inevitable disagreements come up about how much time "Junior" has spent in front of the TV screen, you'll actually have an impartial log to turn to.  The first day, my son spent 6 hours and 47 minutes -- but that will be the exception, not the rule.  Grandma let him go overboard with his new toy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you are a hard-core gamer that has to have photo-realistic graphics, then this probably isn't the system for you.  But if you are looking for something the entire family can enjoy, and doesn't try to be a "me too" system like the PS3 and Xbox 360, I think you'll find this system to be very innovative, very interactive, and very fun.

Wii-the review from someone who actually purchased the product!!!!
Nintendo... remember the days of Super Mario Brothers, sitting in front of the television for hours because of the excitement and total awe of the game, feeling like a child again- that is what the Wii is about. Capturing that feeling of gameplay, making it totally interactive, creative, something we've never seen before, we become part of the video game again. The system is smaller than i thought it would be - fits nicely in an entertainment system- very sleek. The controllers are so easy to use and after about 30 minutes you'll wonder how you ever played a game without them. The graphics are beautiful, smooth lines and rounded edges everywhere -no pixelated graphics here. The interface is simple to use, the instructions are self explanatory. If there were ever a system to wait 6 hours on line in Times Square in the cold, it was this one. The experience was not one I'll soon forget and owning the Wii is definitly something I won't regret. As for the price- it beats out the Xbox360 and PS3. It's affordable, innovative, fun for the whole family - kids will love the nunchuck controller and wii sports, swinging the controller around!!! I absolutely love Nintendo because they do a great job putting a high quality on the market that is affordable for everyone and innovative all at the same time. Enjoy your Wii - if you got one before they all sold out that is...

Wanted to sell on eBay - made the mistake of opening the box to test it out.  Made additional mistake of letting my wife try it.
We got our Wii on the launch day after spending a few hours in line the previous week to reserve it.  Initially, I wanted to re-sell the unit on eBay and then pick one up for myself next year after the initial kinks get worked out.  I noted the box could be opened and the items removed without breaking any shrinkwrap, so I decided to briefly test out Wii sports and make sure everything was working.  I also invited my wife to try it our since she is not really an avid gamer (other than a few DS games and the Sims/Animal crossing on the Gamecube.)<br /><br />Those 2 mistakes ended any idea of parting with the unit on eBay - at any price.<br /><br />There are lots of good reviews of these systems on gamespot and IGN.  If you are trying to decide whether to get a console and which one that is largely a matter of taste.  For us - we like party games, both with sober family or the occasional inebriated friends.  I've tried playing golf with non-gamers before and it has never been much success - you know "push up then down then back up and press these buttons" etc falls on deaf ears.<br /><br />There is nothing to "teach" on how to play the Wii.  My dad who, never plays videogames but likes to go bowling is a great example.  He normally scores around 220 in real life.  The first and only time he bowled on the Wii (it was a short visit) he scored a 217.  That was higher than any of the rest of us scored - and in real life hah hah that is about right.  So if that is any measure of how well the controller works, you have to conclude it works great.<br /><br />If you are lucky enough to score a Wii - pick up Raymin Rabbids with it too.  The party games are awesome.  Can't really explain why they are so much fun since they are borderline ridiculous - never-the-less my wife can't stop playing and the rail-hunt shooting rabbits with toilet plungers has yet to grow old.

Wow, very impressed
My wife and I purchased this console almost completely because of Wii Sports, watching the videos of people.  It looked so different and so fun that we decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />My wife does not play video games, she knows I like them, but has very poor hand-eye coordination and is horrible at video games.  That being said, she has had a blast playing Wii sports and has spent a few hours playing Zelda.  She loves that you actually move to interact with the game.  She doesn't care about graphics or about HD capable, next generation or any of that stuff.  She cares aboutt having fun.  That is what the Wii is, FUN.  <br /><br />I love the system.  I play it too much, but it is so addicting.  Sure the controls are not pin point accurate, but you get used to it, and it really is fun.  The graphics are not crystal clear, but they are good enough.  I enjoy them greatly.<br /><br />It really is a fun system.  I own PC games and sometimes would feel bad, because my wife had no interest in them.  Now she suggests we play the Wii.<br /><br />Very fun

Wii love it!!!!!!!!!!!
On Christmas, I heard that my little brother had bought my parents a Wii. My first thought was what are my 57 years old parents going to do with a video game system. We went to their house that afternoon and I was totally amazed. The entire family from 57 to 3 was taking turns bowling. <br /><br />My husband and I agreed we needed to get one. I couldn't see paying over $500 for it on Ebay, so I called every store withing a 100 mile radius for days until I found one. <br /><br />I know it is not a tremendous amount of exercise, but it is more exercise than just sitting on the sofa barely moving. My theory is to play the game as if you are actually playing the real sport.

Wii will ... Wii will rock you!
I just picked up a Wii yesterday along with Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and I love both! I have not owned a game console since the days of original Nintendo and Atari. I felt very left out by the game clearly designed for either young children or obsessive young males willing to spend 8 hours on a couch twitching their thumbs. I loved Wii Sports so much I have a sore arm today from countless games of bowling, tennis and golf. Yep, even golf is entirely entertaining for hours on Wii. Can Xbox or PS say that?<br /><br />To everyone who gripes that the graphics can't compare to Xbox or PS, Jar Jar Binks used better graphics than Yoda in the original Star Wars trilogy but Jar Jar was still the worst movie character in history! If graphics were the most important part of a game, no one would have played Pac Man.<br /><br />The Wii's graphics are fine. Really, once you play you stop paying attention to graphics. You'll be entirely focused on hitting the pitch coming at you! I've already rushed out and bought Legend of Zelda, too. I love the game play.<br /><br />The Wii is the most innovative platform ever!

The Wii changes everything
I love the whole concept behind the Wii. I read in a magazine about that Reggie guy, everything he gets his hand behind turns to gold. And looks like he's struck gold again. <br /><br />Anyway, the Wii is so much fun. The Wiimote is so resposive. Like seriously responsive. I was playing the golf game at a friends house and I was testing each position of my backstroke from pointing down, diagonal, all the way up to the top and it followed my movements perfectly. It's like having those lights on you to capture your movements. <br /><br />The real reason I'm most happy about the Wii is because this system will make me buy games I never thought I would ever buy. Like I am really looking forward to a Tiger Woods title. And golf bores me. Well watching it. I'm not really into first shooters either, but I'm very much looking forward to the Metroid games and other shooters.<br /><br />It may take a while for developers to make games that really fit the Wii, but I have high hopes for this system.

Wii is an excellent call this holiday season
A bit of disclosure- I was excited about the Wii before I played one. I was camped outside Target all night to ensure that I got one on launch day. So I was All About The Wii.<br /><br />I'm here to say that my expectations were met.<br /><br />One, the bundled Wii Sports was a great move by Nintendo. It may not be as deep as other games, but I've spent a fair amount of time playing tennis and boxing and such things. And it makes for a fun party game; my brothers and I enjoyed 4-player games of tennis and bowling from the word go.<br />Also, it's nice to not only get a relatively inexpensive system, but have something to play out of the box. The last time I saw that was many years ago.<br /><br />The controller is fun. My poor, now-overworked muscles are glad not everything has the grand gestures of Wii Sports (and yes, I'm aware that technically you only have to flick your wrist, but come on, where's the fun in that?), but it's still a neat switch up to the traditional means of playing a game. Also, it has helped some people who have been turned off by gaming in the last few years ("Too many buttons!" is a common complaint) to give it a go again.<br /><br />I can't recommend the Wii enough. Maybe it's not the graphical powerhouse that the Xbox 360 or PS3 are, but what it lacks in glamour it makes up for in fun and innovation. I am especially excited for games that come out six months from now, when developers have gotten a better feel for using the Wii control system. Can anyone say Star Wars games using lightsabers? Oh yes please.

Well worth the wait!
Like many people, it took me awhile to finally obtain a Wii.  But let me tell you, it was well worth the wait!  I got mine on the day after Christmas.  Setup was a breeze, and everyrhing worked right out of the box.  It took me a little while to get connected to my wireless network, but that was my fault (I was using the wrong password :O().<br /><br />For any parents who are planning on purchasing this, let me give you some advice.  Wii Sports which comes with it will provide many hours of enjoyment.  In fact, I bought Rayman's Rabbits for the minigames, since my youngest (6) likes those alot.  In reality, in the four days we have had it, we have been playing only Wii Sports.  While none of the games is really indepth, they are easy to pick up and play.  We have probably had the most fun bowling.  Hats off to Nintendo for such a great included game, and showing the possibilities of the system.<br /><br />I also purchased Zelda for myself, and already put in 4+ hours.  Having played all the Zelda's on the various systems, this one was a must have.  I am really enjoying it.<br /><br />One other point - creating the Miis is a blast.  We spent about a half hour as a family creating all our Miis.  And it is cool how they show up in the various Wii Sports games, even if they are not actually the ones playing.<br /><br />All in all, Nintendo has finally created a game system for the whole family.  No, it doesn't have cutting edge graphics, but it is a lot of fun to play.  Even my wife enjoys bowling, and she is definitely not a "gamer".  And what other system can make you sore the next morning (aka Boxing).<br /><br />Get one for yourself as soon as you can.  You will not be disappointed!

If you are on the fence with this one...
OK, I have two kids ones is an active and outdoor person. The other has to be forced outside. We finally picked this game up at Best Buy after waiting in line for two hours in the cold and rain. It was totally worth it. They are both sweating playing this game, it's an exercise machine too. If you are just thinking about this or are on the fence on whether or not to get it, I have to say you need to take the plunge. My son is finally getting some exercise, and my other son is finally learning to interact with computers. It was win/win for me...<br /><br />

WiiFit Newbie - LOVES the FUN new games!!
INTRO:<br />After years of wanting a Wii, we finally got one! And, of course, like any overly-excited newbie, I couldn't wait to get the new WiiFit (WiiFit Plus). I picked it up at midnight, with the Balance Board. (TIP: if ur buying from brick-and-mortar stores, call ahead, it took me an hour to convince them that it was ok to sell it to me, and it was already 12:30a!) I got home, set it up (took just a few minutes, mostly unwrapping) and played until 5am! I was nearly falling asleep between games, but it was so much fun, I couldn't stop! Now, THAT's a motivator to work out! It even asked if I was a 'NIGHT OWL' and I had the option to keep my "day" 'open' until 3am, for those late-night workout sessions!<br /><br />THE GAMES, & WHY I LOVE THEM:<br />Without leaving my 12'x12' living room, I can do: Circus Juggling, Skateboarding, Island Cycling, HulaHooping, Rhythm Parade, Segwaying, & Perfect 10 - these are the ones I like the most right now. My current favorite is the Bulls-Eye game (you flap your arms to 'fly' over water and reach platforms!) It's just awesome! And, it's cool that most of the activities are all on the same island - so you can bike it, run it, walk it, fly it, segway it, float it, bounce it, etc.! I also like that, in most games (not the Bubble one, tho), you don't 'die' if you do it 'wrong'. Nothing's worse than almost getting to the end of a cycling game, and then running into a tree and having to start over - ugh! But, with WiiFit, it's so pleasant, you just maneuver your way back on track! No stress! Yet, I like that u still do collect points - I already have a competition to 'beat' my BF's scores - I even left him a 'note' on the wii to try to beat mine in a couple of games, when he woke up! We haven't tried the 'multiplayer' mode yet.<br /><br />STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, & KEEPING TRACK:<br />I LOVE the 'make your own' routine - you pick as many activities as you want, from dozens of Yoga Postures, and Strength Training choices (they even tell you how long the total 'workout' will take, as you make your selections) and then you hit 'start'; and it cycles thru them, one-after-the-other, checking off each one, as you go; and, saving the 'routine' for the future. If you don't need to have that much customization, or if you need more guidance, you can choose from 5 options for a pre-made routine (Lifestyle, Health, Youth, Form, & Combine), or you can click the cute balance board graphic and it creates one for you! The tracking capability is nice, complete with graphs, and a visual calendar which I 'stamp' every day I use the WiiFit. You can even add your daily step count AND activities you do outside of the WiiFit! This appeals to my analytical and visual side! Another option it gives you is that you can choose a food (from a selection of 20 or so), and then make a daily goal to burn as many calories as that food has - I didn't realize sticky rice had so many calories!<br /><br />SHOW ME THE NUMBERS:<br />It calculates your BMI from your user-entered height and a balance board-measured weight. The weight measurement seemed a little off, as it made both me and my BF about 5-10 lbs lighter than we've been told, from other scales. But, that's A-OK with me! It seems like it's mostly set up to help you lose weight and burn calories (while improving your balance & posture), however my BF and I have different goals - I'm trying to lose 20 lbs, and he's trying to gain 20 lbs. The Wii did rightfully call him underweight and told him to do strength-training to build muscle. It just laughed at me and told me to 'strap in'! haha - jk!<br /><br />WISHES & BENEFITS:<br />While it might not be 100% perfect (wish there was no 'dying' in the Balance Bubble or Tightrope game; and in the snowball fight, it'd be nice to have the option to physically move my arm to throw, instead of just pushing 'A' to throw; skateboarding goes thru a long 'training run' every time you play; it would be cool if Super Hula Hoop was more than just Left AND Right circles (like add arms or something); and oh, to be able to enter total calories eaten for the day; etc.), it sure is a LOT of fun and DEFINITELY motivates u to MOVE! The corny but pleasant music, scenery, and challenges are already helping me look forward to getting going in the morning and coming home at night. You earn fit credits, with activities, which then allow you to unlock more advanced activities, giving you a good bit of motivation to keep going - imagine if they gave you 'legal trade' currency coins for working out! Plus, it always fits into my schedule: I can do as little as a *minute* of activity or as much as I want! It's closer than a gym, there's no monthly dues, you can wear whatever you want, it's open at 3am, the smoothies are always organic, and (depending on where u play) there isn't that icky/smelly/sticky/germy/loud atmosphere of a typical gym! Team up with a friend, for a little extra motivation and competition!<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />For those who aren't familiar with video games, (or who see them as a 'waste' of time) this is a great one to 'start' with. The Wii is my first real game system (other than an old Intellivision, we've had Super Nintendo, Game Cube, & Playstations in the house, but with all those cryptic buttons and 'codes', and my busy schedule, I never bothered with them). However, the Wii was up and running in no time and the 'controls' are very intuitive. I've even had a lot of 'older' people playing and having fun, in short order! The Balance Board was easy to set up, easy to figure out, and is SUPER fun to play with, oh, and I burned a boatload of calories - woo-hoo! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Wii Balance Board AND the WiiFit Plus!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Did another 30 mins this afternoon: tried the Penguin Game and the Flame and the Tightrope - all were lots of fun (keeping the flame still was a little stressful with noisy neighbors!)<br /><br />UPDATE 2:<br />My parents just came over and I had them try it out, using the "Trial" mode, so they didn't have to go through the in-depth setup process - my mom really liked the HulaHoop activity and my dad really liked the Bull's Eye activity (where you flap your wings to fly and land on targets!) We had such a great time - it was hilarious to watch each other!! The trial mode is a great feature - it lets you share your WiiFit Plus experience with guests who are not looking to set up a whole profile and get weighed and do balance tests, etc. Of course, there are those 'measurement' options in the Trial mode, if a guest user so chooses, they just won't be able to save their profile.<br /><br /><br />I rely on reviews here at Amazon, to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You!<br />

A Must Have for anyone feeling out of shape and GREAT for those recovering from Injury!
Ok, so I'm in my mid 40's, I've broken everything from my neck in 2 places to my ankle in 3 places, my knees were rammed into an engine block at 65mph when I was 25 and haven't been right since, ad in 2 concussions in this lifetime so I don't have the best balance to boot. Then toss in a nice little dose of being peri-menopausal and HATING doing anything outside in the FL Summer, which lasts for 7 months of 90 degree plus weather, and sprinkle that with a tad of depression from NOT being outside which doesn't exactly have you running about the house singling merrily while pushing a vacuum and you have 15 extra lbs that you haven't a CLUE where those little suckers came from ;) ;), and you are flopping and sagging in places you never knew you had to begin with to ad insult to the poundage!  Now according to the wii I'm just above normal putting me in the barely overweigh category, but I FEEL overweight and I know I've gotten weaker/un toned and I FEEL it.<br /><br />I know I needed to and WANTED to get and feel more fit but I HATE gyms, gym rats, the stereo typical gym ANYTHING. I don't want some sleek 20 year old in my face saying "AGAIN, do it AGAIN" I,.e. (you want to look like me, you never ever will..but try, try HARDER) No thanks! <br />I don't want some guy telling me 'a moment on the lips a lifetime on the hips!' either. And tho I think I've seen every late nite infomercial for every get fit contraption there is, and nope, I have not parted ways with my $19.95 yet, nor is their a bow flex in the corner of every room, yet I see many of them for sale in the flyer for $50 bucks HMMMMMMM! <br /><br />So, for about a year now I've been eyeing the nintendo wii with the wii fit. Here, there, everywhere. Then they drop the price. Hmmmm And then they come out with a wii fit PLUS...HMMMMMM. Ok, so me and my $300 dollars took a chance and parted ways. (for the console plus the balance board and wii fit plus) <br /><br />I LOVE THIS THING! Not only does it calculate your BMI and weight and all that. (Even has a place for you to put Fido or Fluffy on the "scale" but I've been too selfish to share yet and see what that's all about. ;) IT'S FUN! And don't let the little weeble looking characters fool you, you WILL get a work out. But what's great, is you're actually smiling because it is cute and engaging and you don't feel the pain till after the fact. And you find yourself wanting to...go do some more, too! I've given it a dedicated TV and room so I can just wander in there and do 1 or 2 exercises, or spend an hour. It also tells you how many calories you've burned for each activity and keeps a running tab-it will tell you how long each day you worked out (cumulative) as well as calories burned, (so I can have that moment on the lips without the lifetime on the hips) for each actively as well as for the day. And IT'S CUTE and it's FUN, I cant say that enough. And it may look easy, but ITS NOT. <br /><br />Now I think any GQ gym rat out there who can do 500 chin ups and runs 5 miles every morning might laugh at it. But if you are just an average person who doesn't want to get out of shape or out of shape person, which are about 90% of us, then its great. Their are a couple more serious sections, Yoga and Weight Training I think, that have more adult looking trainers to guide you, but the rest of the activities are colorful and you are a "weeble". And it lets you know when you are doing great or not so great, and it is not belittling at all, if anything it makes you want to try to do better next time. <br /><br />My ONLY complaint is I hate have to push "A" 3 times to get to a game I already played and know how to play-now if you push A fast you can skip past the tutorials pretty quickly, but it still annoys me, because I want to PLAY IT AGAIN. But on a good note, you can walk away from it or get off of it without messing everything up.<br /><br />And as a person who has been beaten up pretty bad (auto wreck, high speed horse wreck/fall) and who has spent WAAAAAYY tooo much of her life in PT (which can be even MORE depressing than a gym), let me say this, THIS is a GREAT rehab tool. If they would have had one of these in the hospital I would have gotten so much better so much faster. I hope PT rehabs/hospitals and even nursing homes will get and use these! My leg isn't right, nor are my knees or my balance for that matter, but, wow, I can see improvement already! And I go to bed happily sore, but look forward to DOING IT AGAIN! :) So even if you have some disability you can still use this! I even cheat when my leg has had enough and can sit on the board and use my tush for some of the games just as well, and I'm still active and moving my upper half! Oh and another helpful hint...don't do it barefoot like on the box, at the very least wear socks and after hurting the bottom of my sensitive footsie, I now wear rubber soled lightweight slippers to give some cushy to the bottom of my boney feet. :) Works GREAT. <br /><br />The only thing I find a little disturbing is the board says something like "ouch" or "oh" when you step on it. If my scale did that I never would have put on 15lbs LOL! <br /><br />So what are you waiting for...GO BUY THIS, (and I suggest a bottle of Motrin,and maybe a heating pad, because you'll be having too much fun to notice the pain and soreness till after the fact!) :)

You can really feel it
So, after 5 days playing and getting exercises with my Wii Fit Plus (from now on WFP), I think I am ready to write a review, I will try to make it short but useful as possible. (English is not my native language, you will notice immediately).<br /><br />First, about me:<br />I do not go to the gym (have tried but don't get used to), nor do exercises, or run... but I do move around a lot because of my job, I work on the field, so I have to walk a lot, also I do eat consciously, from December 2008 to nowadays I have lost 15 lbs and was decided to not go back.<br />So I was looking at Wii Fit this summer, and knew about WFP and decided to wait. Meanwhile, I was on the blogs, the forums, online videos, about people experience about this game, and I wanted to get fit and have fun.<br /><br />Then, I got WFP:<br />I explored the games, the routines, I was doing my daily body tests, I am true about this and I want to get fit. At the end of the second day with WFP, I felt the lack of exercises in my body, for example the Rhythm Kung Fu, some think this mini game is lame, but my biceps were hurting, probably because of the fast move of the arms forward. The Jack-knife made my abs to shake, I was amazed about how weak I was, when I try to hold a pose and start shaking after 10 seconds, I struggle to keep the poses because I know it is working out my body; I feel it, a start to a better life, so, if you are true about this game, pardon, "Investment", you will feel the work out.<br /><br />Game play review:<br />The game fits my needs; I have a wide variety of choosing how and where I want to work out. Example I can choose a category of exercises to work my arms, abs, legs, etc. Also I can combine those to avoid interruption, and the best of all for me, I can select how long I want to work out, 10 minutes, 15, 30... and the game will arrange the exercises to fit that time, in any of Yoga, Yoga & Strength, or Strength only category, and as you do the poses, the game will put a checkmark on it and continue, so you will "carpe diem" that time as much as possible. <br /><br />About the balance board:<br />I notice immediately something was not right about my weight according to WFP, so I compared my weight on the balance board to a professional scale (you know, like one of those the doctors have on their office), the scale is calibrated correctly, 1 litter of water is exactly 1 kg, since the weight I get from the pro scale is as I am, with my cloths on (unless I want to weight without cloths, then I will have to weight without cloths on the balance board, that would be the more accurate weight of your body), I chose a cero lb discount (the part where I am asked to select the weight of my cloths), and I did the numbers, and found out and offset of 3 pounds, exactly 3 pounds, my balance board is measuring 3 pounds lower than real weight, and I use the balance board on hard floor, so I do not need the leg extensions.<br /><br />Other than that, it is very sensitive and does the job... oh! by the way, you will need a yoga mat if you work on hard floor, as some poses requires you to bend on your knees, and if your hands are sweating, or your feet, you will slide off, so get a yoga mat for extra grip and soften bones/floor contact.<br /><br />So, that's it, my final review, invest on WFP, do not get it just for the games, they do work you out, but I think this game is targeted to do the fit exercises (Yoga and Strength), after your routine, play some mini games to "carpe diem" your daily use of WFP, as those counts too towards your kcal goal (or Cal, with capital C) and time spent.

Review from a disabled player
I purchased the Wii specifically for this set (Wii Fit Plus with Balance Board) after reading about a few differently-abled users.<br /><br />I am wheelchair bound 70% of the time, on a cane 30% of the time after 3 spinal surgeries (I have multiple congenital spinal disorders) and was VERY surprised at how many games I can play! Many of the walking based games can be played just standing there and moving your arms. I've even sat on the board to play the some of the balance based games. When I stand, 60-80% of my weight is supported by my left leg (I basically drag my right one) and the balance games have helped me to regain some of the muscle in my right leg on days when I can stand. I can do 5 of the yoga poses, play about 1/2 of the balance games, and maybe 1/3 of the aerobics games. Strength training is out for me. But the bonus games are a blast...btw, the bubble game can be played sitting down! <br /><br />Since the board is so low, I've found I can step on and off of it (a big wow for me since I can't even walk un-aided) so that also adds to the games I can play. <br /><br />Best of all...it is genuinely fun! I find myself playing every day...sometimes twice a day. And I SWEAT! ME! I am sooooo happy to have something I can do that is safe, I can do at home, I can use with a walker if I need, or sit on my bad days and STILL get a good workout.<br /><br />Even better is that my incredibly in-shape husband can take the SAME GAME, put it on advanced, and be sweating himself in no time! <br /><br />My favorite is the sitting Zen balance game. You sit on the board, back straight, keeping balanced as a candle slowly burns down with nice background sounds and a truly relaxing atmosphere. It's 2 minutes of peace and balance that I always look forward to at the end of my workout.<br /><br />I recommend this to ANYONE with disabilities. My 85 yr old home-bound grandmother could find 10 games she could play. And the basic Wii Sports games that come with the Wii are all wheelchair friendly. No board needed and I've played ALL five (boxing, bowling, golf, tennis and baseball) from my chair. I never thought I'd bowl again...what a blast!<br /><br />In short...if you're disabled, don't write this one off. If you can stand with a walker and move your legs at ALL, you can play lots of games; if you can sit unaided (or maybe rig a backrest) then you can play even more; if you are completely wheelchair bound, I'd stick with the Wii Sports it comes with as all games can be played from your chair. <br /><br />Have fun...I am!!<br />

In Love With Wii Fit!
I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I've always been fairly inactive and now that I'm in my mid-40s, it's been starting to cause an overall lack of stamina and back pain and exhaustion from walking short distances (and I'm not even overweight). But after just 2 weeks of Wii Fit Plus (usually 30 -45 minutes per day), I'm really noticing a difference. I'm thrilled!<br /><br />You can work up a sweat without even noticing because you're having so much fun. The Island Cycling is my favorite (love the Island View Course). It definitely gets your blood pumping. Some of my other favorites include Rhythm Kung Fu, Advanced Step, Hula Hoop, Obstacle Course, Rhythm Parade, Bull's Eye, Jogging and Boxing. There are so many choices that it's hard to imagine anyone not finding something that's fun for them or that suits their needs and goals (unless they're already in great shape).<br /><br />Some of the activities can be a bit challenging to get the hang of (and it seems that different people have trouble with different things). I'm disastrous at skateboarding, but I'm a "calorie torcher" at obstacle course. My boyfriend's 12-year-old son got quickly frustrated with the obstacle course, but I bet he'd be a natural at skateboarding. You just have to find what works for you. Fortunately there are plenty of choices!<br /><br />Another fun feature is that you feel like you're working out with your friends and family. As your family members add themselves to the program (and you can also add your pets), they are featured throughout the game. Your regular Wii friends are featured too, but not as prominently. They cheer you on at the finish line, demonstrate the moves, toss you your hula hoops, march in your band, etc., and your pet can run along side you as you cycle. It can be an added little boost to your workout. Wii Fit Plus also keeps track of your best times/scores, so it's fun to be able to challenge your previous records. It always feel great when you beat your previous best.<br /><br />The yoga is good if you like a more calm, relaxed type of workout. Personally I have a hard time staying away from the more active games, but I'm glad it's there when I want to work on strength.<br />

Wii Fit Plus is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am just using my mom's account to write a review for this, since I do not have an account (I'm only thirteen.) <br />    I was wondering if this game would be fun for me since I'm a kid. After all, I do not want to waste $100. I was expecting it to be boring to do push ups and Yoga; but they were actually really fun. It is surprisingly fun to see if your balance is better day to day and see if you have lost or gained weight. It was really funny to see my dad weigh himself, because his Mii character got fat. It was also really fun to play all the Training Plus, Balance, and Aerobics games. So it is very fun for kids in my opinion.<br /><br /><br />    Here is a summary of a few of the games:<br /><br />TRAINING PLUS:<br /><br />+Rythym Parade: One of my favorites, in it you step in place to the beat and swing the Wii Remote in accordance to the scrolling Icons.<br />+Rythym Kung Fu: An awesome game where you swing the Wii Remote and kick to the beat.<br />+Skate Boarding Arena: You put the balance board on its side and lean to the left and right to turn. A little hard to get the hang of, though.<br /><br />YOGA:<br /><br />+Deep Breathng: You just stand still while breathing.<br />+Cobra: Really fun, and it gives you a nice stretch.<br />+Standing Knee: This one is one of my favorite yoga exercises because it is easier to keep your balance.<br /><br />STRENGTH TRAINING:<br /><br />+Push Up and Side Plank: This one is pretty easy to get a score of 100 on, but pretty tiring if you do 20 Reps.<br />+Push Up Challenge: You can work up to 100 reps of push ups in this. You challenge the trainer and if you beat him, it is quite rewarding, especially it you beat him on the 100 reps. There are also challenge modes for the Jacknife and the Plank.<br /><br />AEROBICS:<br /><br />+Basic Step: This one is kind of hard to get used to, but really fun.<br />+Basic Run: In this you put the Wii Remote in your pocket and run in place. It is kind of annoying if your pocket is roomie, which makes the Wii Remote jiggle around, which messes up your run.<br /><br />BALANCE GAMES:<br /><br />+Ski Slalom: Pretty hard to get used to and not my favorite.<br /><br /><br />In conclusion, is this game right for anyone? I cannot say that. But I can say I like it.

Very Good!!!
I bought my nephews a Wii a long time ago and they fell in love with it and I had to play it every time I visited.  I bought a Wii recently and my wife and I fell in love with it.  <br /><br />We have wanted Wii Fit for a long time and finally got it yesterday.  Wii fit plus is probably one of the best games I've ever played for the Wii.  It is very sensative and all the games are quite fun.   <br /><br />This game has training schedules fit to your needs.  Very entertaining to watch someone play...hahahaha..Tons of fun.  If you dont have this yet and you love the Wii you will not be dissapointed.  Hope you enjoy. Thanks for reading.

Absolutly Wonderful.
This Wii Fit Plus is absolutly the best. I have had no problem with the Wii Fit. I haven't tried the original Wii Fit but this I have. Doing the Wii Fit feel's like your in a Gym. And your doing all sort's of activites. I enjoy all of these game's and I use the Wii Fit everyday. <br /><br />Yoga - Yoga poses that tone muscles and improve posture.<br />Strength Training - Workouts to build and tone your muscles.<br />Arobics - Exercises that help burn body fat.<br />Balance Games - Games that help develop your sense of balance.<br /><br />The game's that are included are extreamly fun. You will not get board with the Wii Fit. It's fun and very helpful. When you hook up your Wii board make sure you put the 4 plates under the Wii board and try not to jump or do crazy stuff on the Wii board, cause that's not what it's for. I highly recommened this Wii Fit Plus to anyone.

LOVE this!
I was in the market for the Wii balance board and I preordered the new board plus these new games.  I am glad I bought the new board and games.  I have worked out for more than an hr and have not realized how long because this is SO MUCH FUN!  My young children get a kick out of watching Mommy work out.  They copy what I do so I know they are getting exercise too.  Don't hesitate!

Love it
I am 60 and obese.  I love working out with this.  It gives me a great workout, is entertaining, and has lots of variety.

finally some exercise I love to do.
I HATE to exercise.  I love to lose weight and love to eat, so for some reason need to exercise to balance everything out.  I love that I can let it pick out my routines and all I have to do is follow them.  Seriously, who would have guessed that you could hit people with snowballs and work on your abs.  Double bonus in my book.  Would strongly recommend this to anyone that hates to exercise but loves to have fun.  PS. I am not a big video game lover either.

Love the Wii Fit Plus!
I did not have the Wii Fit before the "Plus" version came out, but I waited to purchase it because I heard it was going to be better than the first one (i.e. have more games).  It is a lot of fun.  I love the game that came with the board as well as some others I have purchased to use with it.  I love that the board weighs you if you want it to and the "Plus" version of the board goes up to at least 330 lbs or more, that lets me know that I am not going to break it by stepping on it because I am around 280.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs low impact exercises and are getting started with exercise OR for anyone who wants a little variety thrown in to the typical workouts.. I think it's good for everyone.  A lot of my friends (young and older) love the Wii Fit Plus and Balance Board too.  I think the biggest appeal of having it is that some of the games are so fun that you don't even realize that you are burning off calories.  I easily play it for an hour or more and do not even realize I have done so!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Lots of fun if you choose to use it!
With the approach of winter and cold/damp weather I was looking for something to keep me active (I'm a runner) and the Wii Fit Plus didn't disappoint.  It's got a great variety of games and yoga/strength training exercises.  And the fact that it tracks your weight and how many Calories you've burned helps you realize how much you need to work to burn off that ice cream sundae you couldn't avoid.  (Which is precisely why I work out--to eat the foods I love and not feel guilty about it--the good feeling and increased health/immunity to disease are just side benefits.)<br /><br />I should note that you've got to work at it to break a sweat--it's not designed to be a strenuous workout.  However, I think the developers at Nintendo did a good job considering the demographic they'd have to cover (5-95 year olds).  And its a neat way to check out Yoga without having to leave the house.  I'm sure doing it in a class would be more interesting, but this way you can practice a bit before going.  <br /><br />The key to this product, like all exercises, is that you've got to use it for it to be of any benefit.  I highly recommend this product to everyone--you will only benefit from it.

Wii Fit Plus
I am  52 years old, chronically sick, and chubby, so that creates a setting into which this review was typed!<br /><br />This program is wonderful!  It was plug-and-play easy to set up, and within 15 minutes I was standing on the balance board in front of our TV, waiting to see what fun was in store...<br /><br />And I did have fun!  So much fun that before I realized it, a LOT of time had flown by!  I was so interested, I had to try out everything; it seemed I couldn't stop.  The yoga, the strength training, aerobics, and the training games were all fun, accessible for me (meaning they were short enough and plain enough-- explained and illustrated well.) I racked up quite a bit of time spent in honest exercising... so much so, that when I finally forced myself to shut the program down, I had a hard time getting up the stairs because I was so tired.<br /><br />Of course, I was beginner-level at everything, but that was to be expected.  For the fitter and healthier, there were more difficult challenges and options.<br /><br />Get the gel sleeve for your balance board, and keep in mind that you'll use a nunchuk for several of the training games.  <br /><br />I have tried memberships to health clubs (SO hard to get to in the cold weather!) and video/DVD routines (SO boring after a while, and no interactive option)--<br /><br />I am confident this program will be a steady part of my life. <br /><br />I might remain chubby, sick, and older, but I will also be fitter and stronger, thanks to this program.<br /><br />I highly recommend this program, especially to people like me who find, by reason of poor health, that they are stuck in a chair losing strength.  We finally have at least one fun option to fight this decline!  <br /><br /><br />

This is why we bought the Wii -- uses your whole body while having some laughs, too!
<br />Ok, they try to mask this as a fitness thing and have you go through all these pseudo-fit things like humiliating you by displaying your BMI, weight, "Wii Age" on a 60-inch high def for your family to see (are they TRYING to cause DIVORCES?)<br /><br />But once you get past that, they have some really fun stuff for the whole family -- we spent the most time laughing as the kids dodged Panda Bears and soccer shoes or re-enacting the "Agony of Defeat" ski scene from the Wide World of Sports. And while they were doing that, they were actually using their whole body and not just getting carpal tunnel syndrome from your standard video game.<br /><br />The balance board that has been added is very helpful in developing coordination.  I was impressed at how challenging the exercises are but if you are consistent, you will make progress.<br /><br />Are the games on this going to be as effective as a personal trainer at a gym?  Probably not (but overall -- a heck of a lot chepaer).  However, if you are consistent with it, you will see some improvement in overall body tone and conditioning and that is never a bad thing.  I think the true value comes from making "fitness" into a game where the whole family can participate.  Much more interactive than any other video games, these activities will provide the whole family some active fun for the kids while watching some really hysterical graphics (ok, our family is easily amused), I think this has been my favorite part of the Wii experience so far...<br /><br />I highly recommend this game for the whole family.<br /><br />[NCJAR]

Makes exercise fun!
I've never been much for exercise. It's boring, mind-dulling stuff. But this game is making it fun, and I'm actually exercising regularly! It has some flaws -- mostly the advice gets repetitive, and I wish I could put the aerobic games into a routine. But for me it doesn't really matter, because I've gone from couch potato to someone who exercises six times a week, at least 30 minutes to a session. And that is a very good thing.

Family fun
I bought this about two monthes ago. Not only do I enjoy it, but so does my husband and two boys. My oldest son is a bit overweight. This has made increasing his activity so much fun that he does it every day. He has lost weight and gained balance. My husband uses the yoga to stretch his muscles after working out at the gym.

Light, Intuitive, Easy to Use
The Wii Remote Controller is shaped like a standard TV remove, and has motion sensing ability. You wave it around, and your on-screen character waves their wand!<br /><br />This isn't an add-on controller - this is the actual, standard controller that most if not all games on the Nintendo Wii use as their primary control unit. There is also a "nunchuck" that can be used in your off hand, but many games don't use the nunchuck. <br /><br />The aim of the Wii was to make gaming as simple and intuitive as possible for the casual non gamer. Pretty much every person with a TV is comfortable using a TV remote. You point, you click. The Wii Remote Controller works in the same fashion. The motion sensors know what you are doing with the remote. If you're playing a baseball game, you swing at the ball. If you're playing a bowling game, you bring your arm back and swing it forward. Everything "makes sense". A sword swing? A light saber battle? Just move your arm and the character does the same thing.<br /><br />There are only two buttons that really matter. There's an A button on the front that you push for most operations. There's also a trigger underneath that is the B button. Depending on the game, they will have you use one or the other button. There are also a few other buttons for more complex gaming. There's a D-pad. A "home" button lets you go instantly back to the main Wii menu if you're tired of playing. There's a plus and minus button, a 1 and 2 button. There's even a power button. You don't have to walk over to your Wii any more to turn it on or off. Just hit the power button on the remote and you're all set.<br /><br />The remote runs on two AA batteries, so there's no USB plugging in or charging up, as with the other systems' remotes. You do get a wrist strap, though, so the Wii remote doesn't fly out of your hands while you're doing a super powerful golf swing. <br /><br />There's even a speaker in the remote! This is great if you're playing a game against another player. Say I'm boxing my boyfriend and I am the winner. *My* remote says that I triumphed, to me. Neat!<br /><br />I definitely love the Wii remote controller. It's light, it's super easy to use, it's intuitive and I can just pop batteries into it when it runs out, instead of having to wait for a recharge. Highly recommended. Just note that if you want to play a game that needs a nunchuck as well, that you have to buy that separately.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Buy an Extra One
As fun as the Wii can be, it only gets better when you play head-to-head against family and friends.  Since the standard Wii packaging only includes one controller, you will need to order a second device to experience the optimal level of game play.  <br /><br />Holding the controller reminds me most of holding a fishing pole.   The thumb and index finger control the most essential functions of the players, with extra buttons only really coming into play during mode selection screens.  During live action, players don't toggle between much more than two buttons.  <br /><br />Batteries seem to be an issue for many people, but not me.  I suggest you turn off the "rumble feature" for games (the controller vibrates or pulsates during dramatic moments in games) as a way to save battery use.  I've gotten about 30 hours out of each round of batteries on my Wii.<br /><br />Lastly, believe what people say about collateral damage with your Wii controller.  I thought the stories of people breaking TVs, windows and fish tanks by accidentally losing grip of their controller during a strong tennis swing and sending a dangerous projectile through their living rooms were exaggerations.  But it happened to me...and it will happen to you.  <br />

great game, but don't get ripped off !
You can go right to the Nintendo website and buy the controllers at the MSRP. It took only 3 days for them to ship mine. Don't pay a bunch extra to these foks trying to take advantage of a "shortage"

Wii Remote=Great Success
When I first saw the Wii remote I was very skeptical that Nintendo could pull such a thing off, then, after seeing all the hype and others who got a chance to use it say that it was easy and fun, I began to turn a new leaf. I must say that this controller is the best controller I have used in many years. The Wii remote is very sensitive which is great because all the games require a high sensitivity for then  to be played to the best of their ability. I currently own Zelda Twilight Princess, Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Excite Truck, each are very unique in their own in which they use the Wii Remote and are great fun to use. They only problem I have is that I can't seem to find a place to buy a second one!

Limited Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Wiimote (WII REMOTE) is a great item. Although, when you purchase a Wii, you receive 2 Panosonic Batteries (unrechargeable). I played the Wii for 4 days. On the 4th day it had a small amount of power left. I recommend you buy rechargeable NiMH batteries, just so you won't have to keep buying, and buying batteries. This is from my experience.<br /><br />NY- Anish

Wii wins over family
Nintendo has really hit the mark with an innovative and fun approach to video games, and it all begins with this remote. Light, intuitive and keenly motion sensitive, my family has not put down the remote pair we received for Christmas yet! I do worry about the strap issues (it slipped from my grip once already, but no snapping) and battery life is reported to be short, but I already own 6 rechargeable AA's for digital cameras that might have to double as Wii batteries. The remote has worked well in all our titles (Sports, Zelda, Madden, Tony Hawk- our neighbors have Metal Slug, Red Steel and Excite Truck, more on them later). I would like to see a nunchuck bundle though. All our relatives who have played (ages 7 to 70) have found the Wii easy to use, and after only moments of instruction were all gleefully swatting tennis balls and bowling strikes together!

Changing How We Play Games
The Wii remote has already proven a success for Nintendo.  It truly adds to the gameplay of a game.  This remote can be used as a sword (Red Steel, Zelda) a gun (Red Steel, Call of Duty 3) or even just using the motion sensor to imitate motions is good enough (Wii Sports, Madden NFL 2007).  The remote itself cretes a more interactive feel for the game.  Imagine, if you will, that your character's action on screen depends upon your very own.  In other words, this isn't button mashing, this is real interface.  Nintendo scores here. <br /><br />The remote takes two AA batteries in order for you to get the ball rolling.  In games, it serves as your form of play.  On the Wii menu it serves as your pointer.  Almost like a mouse to a PC.  You'll be able to click on things, shop and start up Wii channels all from this remote.  Also, while in the middle of a game, the remote can be used to return to the Wii Menu at any time by simply pressing the home key.  The buttons, as well as the trigger are all quick and responsive.  <br /><br />Aside from the motion sensor, there is more glitter and gold to the Wii remote.  For starters, it actually does work with some virtual console games.  For NES, Turbo Grafx-16 and Sega Genesis the Wii Remote actually does work to play these games.  While it makes more sense to use a Gamecube Controller or buy a Classic Controller for virtual download, it's nice that you are able to use the remote to play some of the more basic games. It can't be used for SNES or Nintendo 64 at all, though. <br /><br />When purchasing a Wii Remote, you may also want to consider getting a nunchuck attachment as well.  Most games work using the Wii remote and nunchuck.  There aren't that many out there that require just the remote.  So you'll always want a nunchuck as well, which attaches to the base of the wii remote.  Additional Wii remotes are also a must for multiplayer.  This does ramp up the price, however, as additional Nunchucks are twenty more dollars you'll have to spend.  In addition, buying a classic controller (which also attaches into the base of the wii remote) for the virtual console also costs an additional twenty dollars. It can be costly, but for the additonal multiplayer aspect it can indeed be a good investment.  <br /><br />Perhaps the only thing that keeps the Wii Remote down is that for any avid or hardcore gamer, the battery life doesn't last long.  The batteries die out quite fast.  The default batteries that come with the remote die out in less than a week, and replacement batteries don't last long either.  It's far better to buy rechargable batteries for your Wii remote than it is to keep running to the store and buying batteries over and over.  Also, when playing, there's no warning that your batteries are low during gameplay.  You'll know when they've died of course, but it'd be nice to have a warning. <br /><br />It's a great controller, and as usual it's best to buy from Nintendo rather than third party controllers.  It can be costly if you figure in the nunchuck and/or virtual controller, and it drains batteries fast, but it's still a good controller. <br /><br />The Good<br /><br />+Changing the way we play games<br />+Alert and responsive controls<br />+Navigation through menus is really easy<br />+Attachments are easy to connect<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />-Nunchuck is sold separately, and it's needed for many games... I've no problem buying the classic controller separately, but it's strange that Nintendo wouldn't sell the remote and nunchuck in a bundle<br />-Drains battery life fast, but this can be remedied with rechargable batteries. <br /><br />Happy gaming!

Great Replacement + it's Good to Have an Extra

The Wii Remote Controller - wireless technology at its best
I love my Wii remote controllers.  I have three of them.  The first two came with my Wii, and the third came with my Wii Play.<br /><br />As far as batteries are concerned, rechargeable batteries are good.  The charge station from Nyko is better.  I prefer the 4-remote Energizer recharger the most.<br /><br />Have a look at the photo of the product on this page.  See the clear plastic case the remote is in?  That's known as a remote jacket.  You can order those, as well as replacement straps, on the nintendo website.  Both can be had for free.<br /><br />On a whole, the Wii remote controller outranks the controllers from Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System many times over.

Get it used!
Obviously a remote is essential.  I recomment getting it used, I managed to find a two-pack for $30.  Otherwise buy Wii-Play for $10 more with the wii-mote and you have some funny mini-games to play with.  The cow racing on Wii-Play is hilarious.

A necessary purchase for multiplayer Wii use!
If you have a Wii, another remote is necessary for multiplayer use. <br /><br />For those who don't know what a Wii remote is, here's a description:<br /><br />You get one Wii remote with your Wii. The Wii remote is almost like a real remote in that to play, you must point the remote to the screen and press buttons on the remote. Most buttons are used for game play but you also have a home button which acts as a "Start" button when comparing it to other video game systems that pauses the game and can take you back to the main screen. The bottom of the remote lights up and if you're using more than one remote, each remote will light up different squares to show you which player you are. For example, if the second square is lit on your remote, you would know that you're player 2. There's also a strap that you place on your wrist so that you don't accidentally throw the remote across the room while your playing.<br /><br />Battery-wise, my batteries haven't died yet and I've used them a few times a week for a couple of months (each time playing 1 hour or more). However, I have a battery charger on hand to charge them when they die rather than getting more expensive batteries because even more expensive batteries die eventually.<br /><br />To completely enjoy the Wii to the fullest, an extra controller (or two or three) would be a wise thing to purchase.

Revolutionary
I've been playing computer and video games for over 2 decades now, and this amazing controller is re-energizing game-play for the first time in years.  Old game-play concepts are fun again, and more importantly, a multitude of new game-play concepts have been, and will be, invented to utilize the Wiimote.    The force-feedback, plus the small speaker make even mundane things like rolling over a menu button *feel* "real".  The first time you swing the Wii remote as your racket in Wii Sports Tennis, you'll realize gaming will never be the same again.

It Beams Money!
Well not really.  The first description of the Product Features says (Or at least it one point said) "Beams money through Bluetooth up to 30 feet away"! If only this were true it would save a lot on gas because I know someone would mod it and have a Wii at work.  For most of us though, we can't bring our Wii to work and are forced to play them only from the confines of our homes.  When you do this, it's best to have some friends over.  And if your going to drink and play... be safe and wear the safety strap, enough innocent TVs have died this year alone from PWWI (Playing Wii While Intoxicated).  And while you are at it, get a few more Wii remotes like this one.  No more playing with a remote covered in someone else's sweat. And if you are a big enough nerd, you can mod your computer to accept the Wii Remote commands.

I guess you can never have too many
I bought two of these when I bought my first Wii console.  The description and pictures of the Wii console made it seem as if both controllers in the box were wired, when in fact the remote is wireless and the nunchuk is wired.  So in essence I bought two Wii wireless remotes for the wrong reason.  Now that I have three wireless ones, I'm not upset about spending the extra $35.  You never know when one will die, when you'll accidentally break it, or get angry enough over losing a game to intentially break it.  Now I have an in-house back-up for any case.

Ingenius!
Must have for the Wii if you have multiple players.  One should actually get their second Wii remote along with Wii Play, but any additional ones, you can get separately on its own.  I'm not a hard care gamer so the lay out of buttons are not overwhelming.  Great interface with Wii games such as Wii Sports, Wii Play<br />.

Small issues here and there
Just a few things I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews.<br /><br />Rechargable batteries vs. weight - I purchased Energizer Rechargable NiMH batteries specifically for our Wii Remotes.  They are a little pricey but they last an impressive amount of time per change.  During a trip to a friend's house with the Wii in tow one pair happened to die, so he found some traditional coppertops to replace them with.  The weight difference is insane.  In games like Wii Sports Tennis where controller swing timing is crutial it feels like it makes a difference.<br /><br />1, 2, 3, 4 Player? - We've noticed when running 4 Wii Remotes at a time they tend to jump around as to which Remote is actually which number of player.  You may exit a game that you were just player 3 on, the third blue light on your remote is lit, but your hand onscreen is red and has a 2 in it.  It doesn't affect gameplay really, but tends to be frustrating considering we're talking about the most expensive "standard" controller on the market now.<br /><br />Wish there was an independant off switch - Ready to play, just grab a Remote and push the A button (or 1 and 2 simultaneously) to have it attempt to begin communicating with the Wii.  But when not it use you almost have to place it on an alter all by itself, so it doesn't happen to sit face down constantly trying to sync, and draining your batteries.

The original Wii controller...
We had 2 Wii controllers and needed two more.  I did not realize until searching for two more controllers that some controllers are not exactly like the two that came with our Wii.  However, we found what we wanted (the original Wii controller) on Amazon and ordered it.  And, the product is exactly what we expected.  Works great - totally satisfied with this purchase!

a versatile controller
The Wii controller is great. It can be used both as a traditional controller and as a remote "wand." It fits comfortably in your hand. Nintendo did a great job with the Wii.

Great Add-On for two handed games
In martial arts, nunchucks are a pair of short wood rods connected with a chain that ninjas whirl around their bodies :) With the Wii, the nunchuck is a single controller held in your off hand.<br /><br />The nunchuck is not the main controller unit for the Wii. The Wii primarily uses the Wii Remote, shaped like a TV remote, for its functionality. The Nunchuck is for use in the "other hand" (i.e. your left hand if you're right handed) just for a few games. It plus into the bottom end of the Wii Remote with a cable that's about 2 1/2 feet long. Most of the time, you leave it unplugged and sitting by the console.<br /><br />For example, in the sports pack that comes with the Wii, only one of the five games uses the nunchuck. This is the boxing game. You use the nunchuck to hit with your off hand, just as you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your primary hand. <br /><br />The nunchuck has the same motion sensing technology as the Wii remote does, so that you can move your hand around and the game knows what you are doing. The buttons are much simpler - there is a Z big trigger button, a smaller C trigger button above it, and then a joystick up on top. For some games, no buttons are used at all. <br /><br />The cable length is designed so you don't trip yourself with it :) It's long enough that if you held your hands apart, you could easily ride even a wide-handled bike. It's not long enough that you could put both arms straight out to the left and right, though. I've never had any problems with the cable length hindering me. None of the games require you to have your hands far apart. In boxing, for example, your hands are always near each other and there's plenty of cable length even when you're jabbing.<br /><br />The nunchuck doesn't need its own power - it plugs into the Wii remote controller when it's in use. So there's no worry about charging up or batteries.<br /><br />I would definitely have at least one functional nunchuck for my Wii, and if you're really into multiplayer two-handed games like boxing matches, then having two would be important. However, for most gamers, one will probably suffice!

If you're going to buy an extra Wii Remote, this is an absolute must-have!
In case you are unfamiliar with the Nunchuk, it is an accessory that simply plugs into the bottom of any <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IMWK2G">Wii Remote</a>. You may have seen Nintendo saying things like "with the Wii Remote, to hit a tennis ball, simply swing the Wii Remote". This is true for some games, for many others, it is not that simple.<br /><br />How would one play a game like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess without a Nunchuk? How would you control your character and swing your sword? Would you simply use the + control pad (on top of the Wii Remote) to move your character, and when you get some action, start swinging? How would you move around while in combat? Why am I asking so many questions?<br /><br />This is where the the Nunchuk adds depth and variety to games like Zelda. The Nunchuk has two buttons (Z and C) and an Analog Stick. In Zelda, the Analog Stick is used for character movement, the Z button is for aiming, and the C button is used to look around. Some games use them (Zelda, Metroid Prime 3 etc.) and some don't (Boxing in Wii Sports... I think that's it). But the most innovative feature of the Nunchuk isn't ON the Nunchuck, but rather IN it.<br /><br />It has a built-in accelerometer, which in human terms, means that it shares some of the motion-sensing abilities with the Wii Remote. What kind of motion-sensiing abilites you may ask? I'll give some examples.<br /><br />When you shake the Nunchuk in Zelda, you do a spin-attack. When you "punch" with it in Boxing (included in Wii Sports), you punch the character you are fighting against. It may not have the pointing abilites of the Wii Remote, but it shares the core motion-sensing abilites, which it also shares with products like the iPhone and SIXAXIS PS3 controller.<br /><br />To summarize, the Nunchuk attachment isn't only a cool add-on for the Wii Remote, but it is a neccessary add-on for the Wii Remote. It will set you back around $20, but it is better to buy it now than hear your kids endlessly nag you about it. They are very durable, very innovative, and very fun.

A necessary add on for certain Wii games!
If you have a Wii, you probably noticed one of these controllers included with your system. Certain Wii games require you to attach a nunchuk to your Wii remote.<br /><br />I'll admit that when I first saw the nunchuk, I thought it would be impossible to use two controllers at once so I purposefully bought games that didn't need a nunchuk to play. However, I really wanted the Resident Evil 4 game and it required a nunchuk to play. I bought the game anyway, whipped out my nunchuk, and sat down to play.<br /><br />I was extremely surprised how easy it was to use both controllers at once. Of course I had a bit of a rough time for the first 15 minutes of play, but from there it was a breeze. The Resident Evil 4 game needs a nunchuk to use the joystick as well as the two buttons because all of the buttons on the Wii remote have uses and the makers obviously needed more buttons. The boxing game that is included in the Wii sports game uses a nunchuk as well. You can simulate the boxing "stance" using the remote and nunchuk. There are quite a few games that need the nunchuk. Don't shy away from games that need a nunchuk because of how complex it looks. I assure you it's simple to use!<br /><br />If your nunchuk is broken or you need an extra one for multiplayer use, I completely recommend buying this.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Simply, a MUST HAVE!
The bottom line is that if you own a Wii, you should have one nunchuk for every Wii remote.  Not every Wii game requires a nunchuk, but you don't want to be stuck with out it when a game comes along that offers greater precision and control through use of the nunchuk.<br /><br />In general, the control stick on the nunchuk will allow you to control your on-screen character (ex. Mario Galaxy).  However, because the nunchuk also features motion sensitive controls it can serve as your left hand in games such as boxing.<br /><br />Wii is very enjoyable with just a Wii remote, but if you intend to get the most out of your Wii, make sure to have 4 Nunchuks and 4 Wii Remotes!<br />

Nothing Bad, a good controller.....
The Wii Nunchuck Controller is an attachment to the Main Wii Controller which is sold seperatly. Theres really nothing much to this except you most likely need this for most games that are out right. I just wish they didn't have to sell this seperatley from the main Wii COntroller because the Nunchuck is an important thing to have. Why do we have to pay over $20 just to get this which can only be powered by the wii controller and that the only thing that this has are 2 buttons and a Joy-Stick. A more reasonable price for this is $9.99 or maybe even $14.99, but over $20 is a little much for this kind of thing.

Good Accessories
The Wii Nunchuck is neccessary in boxing especially when boxing a friend.  It is a great nonobtrusive workout.  Overall the Wii is a system that has been needed for a long time and I am glad it is finally here.  The Nunchuck is a part that increases the Wii's enjoyment.

Essential For Many Wii Games
The Wii Remote itself is a revolution in gaming.  The nunchuck attachment, which is essential to play many Wii games (Zelda for instance) is something to add on to that revolution.  <br /><br />The nunchuck is easy to set up.  Simply plug it into the base of the Wii remote and you're ready to go.  The remote uses sensors.  The nunchuck also uses sensors to perform certain actions in games.  In Red Steel, for instance, you'll need to use the nunchuck to knock over tables.  In The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess you'll need to use it to perform a spinning slash attack.  <br /><br />On the other hand, the nunchuck is mostly used in games where you'll find yourself having to move your character around.  The nunchuck has a control stick for this reason.  It also has a C button and Z button that can be used in many games. These buttons, as well as the motion sensor, are very responsive.  The better part?  The nunchuck doesn't take batteries.  However, it should be noted that the nunchuck attachment will drain the batteries in your wii remote faster.  <br /><br />There is really only one problem that I have with the nunchuck: It's sold separately from the wii remote.  While not every wii game needs the nunchuck attachment, a great deal of them do.  As of this time, Nintendo is not selling the nunchuck and wii remote in a bundle together.  Instead you'll have to buy them separately, and if you buy an additional remote, you may want to buy a nunchuck to go with it.  This can be costly.<br /><br />Still, the nunchuck is a great attachment, and is actually essential to enjoying all of the interative goodness Nintendo's new gaming system provides to gamers.

Great Controller
This controller is used for the Wii Sports boxing game and tons of other games. You just need to attach it to the end of the remote and you can play! You can't play some games without it! You should have one on your TV Just in case.

textured back is a nice surprise
both the black wiimote and black nunchuck have a nice, hidden surprise -- a matte (textured) finish on the backs!  the top/front is still shiny, glossy, Darth Vader-black, which the matte is more of a charcoal<br /><br />why is this a bonus?  it makes both the wiimote and nunchuck much, much easier to grip and use without jackets.  with my white nunchuck, i find it hard to play at all without a silicon sleeve due to its slipperiness.  this is not an issue with the matte finish.<br /><br />it's a small benefit, but worth it.

Must have, sometimes
I bought this because I was told you absolutely need this to play.  And for some games that is true.  Not for most of the ones I have though.  So yeah, you need it for the second controller you had to buy, but I don't know why they don't package them right.  Two controllers and 2 nunchuks in the box with the system.  They know you need them anyway.

Good Fun
It really helps if you have a game that needs the nunchuck. It really makes two player games more exciting instead of just sitting and watching one person play while you wait your turn. GET IT.

Great for games that require it
So, if you are looking at this, you must have the Wii. If you have not played a game that requires this, you are in for a lot of fun. This  nunchuck is very comfortable and fits in my hand well. It is intuitive and easy to handle. It also takes a beating, as the two originals we have been using have survived my 4 and 5.5 year old kids well.

Games like this are the reason I own a Wii!!
I have been playing video games since the Atari 2600, and was a kid during the Nintendo Entertainment System era.  Some of my fondest memories involve one iconic set of characters: Mario, Luigi, Toadstool, and Princess Peach.  Over the years, games have changed (some changes for the good, and others...not so much), but I love that the Mario series have stayed true to their roots. Every Mario game that I can think of has stood the test of time, and has served as a model to countless other games.  However, despite being one of the best game franchises around, one component was always missing: multiplayer.  Sure, previous SMB games had a "2 player" option, but all you were able to do was pass around the same joystick, or take turns using 2 joysticks.  The idea of 2 characters on screen at the same time seemed strangely impossible for these games... and why Nintendo wasn't able to make this happen sooner than 2009 boggles the mind.  But, having spent 7 or 8 hours playing New Super Mario Bros yesterday, I don't care why or how they were able to finally do it...because this game is an absolute blast to play!<br /><br />As soon as the game starts, you start to get an idea of just how great this game is going to be...  especially if you have played Super Mario games before (and cmon...who hasn't?!?).  Everything looks very familiar, but in a good way.  The game really feels like they took some of the best ideas, bosses, levels, and music from each of the Mario games and retooled them for NSMB Wii (New Super Mario Bros Wii).  In fact, it feels mostly like Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros 3 rolled into one, with a little bit of Super Mario Galaxy thrown in as well... and that, my friends, is an AWESOME combination!  Like I mentioned earlier...I have played hundreds...maybe thousands of video games in my time.  And this game ranks right up there with the best of them.  It is, in my humble opinion, on par with Super Mario Bros 3, which has been rated by numerous gaming sites as the best game of all time.  Playing the game for the first time, there were lots of "oohs and ahhs", plenty of mischievous giggles, lots of punching and name calling (see multiplayer), and even several times where one of us paused the game just to point out how great this game is.  I hate to gush over this game, but it really is a work of art.  It's easily one of the best games I have ever played, and certainly one of the best available on Wii.  Here are some of my observations about it:<br /><br />Old Skool SMB:  Mario games are good, and they work. Period.  This is one series of games that doesn't need to be retooled, revamped, updated, or changed dramatically in order for it to compete with the likes of Modern Warfare 2.  In fact, there really is no competition for Mario games.  Historically, they sell, are highly rated, and have a long shelf-life.  This game is no different.  It is classic Mario at his best.  There are some updates that make the game fresh and interesting, but it is mostly classic Mario 2-D action, and that is a good thing.<br /><br />Music:  Mario games have always had great music.  Who hasn't  found themselves whistling or humming one of the iconic  Mario tunes?  This game has some really cool new music, as well as some remixes/revamps of classic Mario music.  When I found myself in the first of the Koopa Kid castles and I heard the original music from Super Mario Bros 3(??), I was ecstatic.<br /><br />Multiplayer:  For the life of me, I couldn't tell you why Nintendo was never able to incorporate some genuine multiplayer in a Mario game previously.  But, add it they did, and it is great.  The multiplayer component of Super Mario Bros Wii is really well done.  There are some competitive modes where you and your friends (or opponents) are running through a level and competing to get the most coins, and it is really fun.  But where multiplayer really shines is when you are actually playing through the games with a couple of your friends.  All of you are on screen at the same time.  When you hit one of the "?" boxes, 3 or 4 mushrooms may come out... or maybe 2 mushrooms and 1 Penguin suit...and you have a choice:  Will we all go scrambling for the penguin suit?  Or will the most skilled player just take a mushroom suit and leave the penguin suit to the others?  Or, will I scramble and get all of the mushrooms and the penguin suit, leaving my teammates out in the cold?  I tried all of these scenarios, and it was pure joy to see the look on my friends faces either way!  You see, the multiplayer can be either competitive or cooperative.  There will be times where getting a big coin or a 1-up will require that you cooperate...maybe I will need to pick up one player and hold him over my head, and then another player will bounce off his head to get the 1-up.  Or, maybe there will be a player that I want to give some grief... so I can pick him up and throw him down a pit or in the lava... or I can throw a green shell at him.  There will also be times where you are all trying to accomplish something (like jumping across a lava pit), and because we are all scrambling and trying to save our own skin, one player will bounce off the other's head, giving themselves a boost up and over the lava, but sending their friend to their death.  As you can imagine, the cooperative multiplayer would FREQUENTLY and unexpectedly become competitive, and there was no shortage of amazed/shocked looks back and forth (i.e "Dude... I cant believe you just did that!!"), punches in the shoulder, name calling, calling "dibs" on power ups only to be disappointed, and laughing ranging from a mischievous giggle to rolling on the floor in stitches.  When we were playing, one guy even got really upset and went home!  LOL.  It was one heck of a fun afternoon!  Once the sore loser left, we started cooperating more and competing less, and it was equally fun. Almost equally anyway...<br /><br />Difficulty:  I hate easy games, and I hate short games.  I especially hate short and easy games. This game is neither.  From what I have experienced so far, this is one of the most challenging Mario games I have ever played.  It isn't necessarily HARD...anyone can pick up New Super Mario Bros Wii and begin playing.  That is the case with every Mario game.  But it is challenging.  You will die...a lot.  Especially when playing multiplayer, since frequently one of your teammates will do something that sends you to your end on accident.  Plus, the difficulty really starts to ramp up in some of the later worlds/levels.  Also, there are 3 hidden achievement coins in each level, as well as these special "star" coins that you can go out of your way to find...and getting to some of these can be a real challenge.  I estimate that it will easily take 20+ hours to complete this game... and even once it is done, it will be a blast to start over and play again.  And the truth is, Mario games are always long and fairly difficult... I never did beat Super Mario 2!  I think this game is going to have a long shelf life at my house!<br /><br />I will spare you any more gushing details about this game. Clearly, I enjoyed it immensely.  If you own a Nintendo Wii, you should own this game.  If there was ONE Wii game I would recommend you buy, it would be this one.  If you are considering buying a Nintendo Wii because you like this game...I guarantee it will be worth it.  This game is destined to be a classic, and it would be a shame to miss out!  Here is my personal rating for the game:<br /><br />Gameplay: 10/10<br />Presentation: 9/10<br />Sound/Music: 9/10<br />Multiplayer: 9/10<br />Difficulty: 10/10<br />Lasting Appeal: 9/10<br />Overall: 10/10

It's Super Mario Bros. 1 through 3 and Super Mario World Combined!
It's a blast from the past. In the 80's you probably played Super Mario Brothers on the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Over 19 years have passed since the last 2D-side scrolling installment of the Mario Brothers Series was released on a gaming console, Nintendo now brings you New Super Mario Brothers Wii.<br /><br />This game is based off of what Nintendo started in 1985. The game play is very similar to Super Mario Brothers 3 and World (SNES). There are One to Four players. This time around Nintendo has you all playing together (cooperative or competitive) - alternating version is not available - no need to wait for your turn to play. You can play as either Mario, Luigi, or 2 different Toads.<br /><br />This game goes back to Nintendo's and Mario's roots for what jump started the video game industry. If you are familiar with the series you will find many things reminiscent of past mario games, for example:<br /><br />8 Worlds : SMB, SMB2, SMB3<br />Flag Ending: SMB<br />Riding Yoshi: SMBW<br />Maps for World: SMB3, SMBW<br />Item House: SMB3<br />Saving Princess Toadstool: SMB, SMB2, SMB3, SMBW<br />Pipes: SMB, SMBW<br />Half Way Save Point: SMBW<br />Koopas Castles: SMB3, SMBW<br />Items: Mushroom, Firepower, Star<br /><br /><br />All the characters are back from Bowser to Goomba's, Bullet Bills, Chain Chomps and more.<br /><br />Game play is the same from earlier versions of Mario Bros series.<br /><br />New things include:<br /><br />Add or remove multiplayers while you are playing a game -- no need to quit because someone is tired of playing, add them back in when they want to play or when people come over.<br /><br />Items:<br />Propeller mario -- shake wiimote to propeller into the sky.<br />Penguin Mario: Move more freely in water and on ice -- shoot ice balls. Belly slide on snow to kill enemy's.<br /><br />Ice Mario: Freeze enemy's and use them as a block to jump on.<br /><br />Star Coins: Use these to unlock hints for each level in Peach's castle.<br /><br />Super Guide: Die 8 times in one level and watch how to beat it or let the computer beat it for you and move on.<br /><br />Multiplayer Mode: New as you can lock yourself in a bubble if your friends can not get through a tough section -- and you unlock yourself out of the bubble when you want to play again.<br /><br />If you die, you come back if you have remaining lives to help the team.<br /><br />New Modes: Coin Battle -- battle in a level to get most coins.<br />           Free for all -- play any course with your friends.<br /><br /><br />All in all this game is great if you are new to the Mario Francise, a casual gamer, fan of the original Mario series, multiplayer gaming, and want to have some old school fun. I recommend this game to everyone who owns a Wii. This is what Mario Should have been the first time around. Simply Amazing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

THIS is how you make a throwback.
The only really bad thing about New Super Mario Bros. Wii is the excessively long title.  Nintendo could have been justified in simply calling this game Mario Bros. 4 or Super Mario World 2, because it fits right in with the legendary series of 2D games from the NES/SNES era.  <br /><br />Mario is one of a very few characters who survived the jump from 2D to 3D.  Mario 64 was revolutionary, and Super Mario Galaxy even more so.  So it might seem odd that Nintendo would go back to a traditional side-scroller in the midst of 3D gaming.  I for one am glad they did.  Yes, there is something to be said for the nostalgia factor: the game goes out of its way to reference previous games in the Mario series, from the enemies to the music.  But make no mistake, this is a NEW game with NEW, very CHALLENGING, levels.  It may come as a surprise to those who were introduced to Mario via Galaxy or New SMB on the DS just how much harder this game is compared to those.  NSMB Wii has a difficulty level on par with Mario 3 or Mario: The Lost Levels (aka Mario 2 in Japan).  This game is relentless with agressive enemies, tricky platforming, and those classic secret areas that you can often see but can't fathom how Mario can reach them!  <br /><br />The gaming community has been very nervous about this game's new feature that allows you to "skip" a level after dying eight times.  Will this create a culture of gamers who cheat and don't get to feel the sense of accomplishment that those who stick with the game for hours upon hours honing their skills?  To that I say, relax.  If you don't want to use the feature, you don't have to.  Further, the feature doesn't show you how to reach all the secrets in the level.  It's not an instant "I Win" feature.  Anything that allows game designers to make creative levels without fear of holding back because they might make the game to hard is a good thing.  <br /><br />The multiplayer feature of this game is frantic and fun.  It's an interesting mix of collaborative and cooperative play that works great.  Added games like Coin Battle and Free for All make this a very complete package.<br /><br />This game should herald a new beginning for 2D games.  With a market saturated with FPSs, I for one am glad that there's still a company making "traditional" platformers and realizing that the gaming past can still influence the future of gaming.

Fun for both of us
My wife and I have played through worlds one and two, and we are both really enjoying the game.  The game is a very good combination of challenge and fun, and we've found ourselves laughing out loud at the fun and intensity of the experience more than once.

Mario Bros at its best!
New Super Mario Bros Wii is an experience that every fan of the classic 2D Mario games may want to purchase and play.  It features the same sort of game style that we have come to expect from all of those classic Mario games and combines most of their mechanics into one game.  It uses mechanics that were seen in Super Mario World 2 with the ability to ride Yoshi, some of the music choices from those games, some of the level designs and mechanics from Super Mario Bros 1, 2, and 3, and uses their music.  It is loaded with so many references and uses of enemies, items, and mechanics that it brings a smile to my face everytime I play through a level.<br /><br />Playing the game is really quite simple. First there are three modes of gameplay; the main story in which up to 4 people can take control of the characters (Mario, Luigi, and two toads), and progress through the levels (even with more than one player, the levels can be progressed through and unlock more).  There is a free for all mode in which everyone is competing for score, and a coin battle mode in which you compete for score. Free-for-all and coin battle only work on stages that have already been cleared.<br /><br />The game is essentially easier with one player for one doesnt have to worry about other players pushing them into obstacles nor do they have to worry about what the other players are doing or the number of powerups they take from you.  There are some benefits such as being able to ground pound simultaneously to clear the enemies off the screen, or jump on each other to read greater heights. It can be fun with more people if everyone is on the same page and not just throwing each other around and pushing obstacles into them (and its a great crutch to use since it essentially equates to at minimum of 5 lives per player on screen if a level is that hard).  For single players there is a super guide function which has Luigi take over and complete the level for you, if you die eight times on a stage.<br /><br />Control wise, there are two styles of play, single wii-remote and wii-remote and nunchuk.  Controls are easy to grasp and I wont go into detail here, but there are what I consider waggle controls (shake the Wiiremote and the character will spin to go a little bit further when making a jump, shake it to move closer if you are floating on a stage, and lastly, shake it to lift obstacles).  The controls are easy to grasp and not too difficult.<br /><br />Presentation wise, the graphics are excellent for the game and get the job done.  Sure it isnt a game that is graphical defining on the Wii but they do look crisp and clear for a game set in the Mario Universe. Most of the good looks here is the chance to see nostalgic enemies and environments in a new 480p light. Soundwise, nothing new hear in terms of sounds for the Mario universe, Mario and Luigi appear to have the same soundbites (Toad sounds just the same as they were in Super Mario Galaxy), songs sound either remixed from their classic counterparts or are all memorable.   Nintendo seems to have delivered a great experience in terms of presentation here.<br /><br /><br />-------<br />The bottom line is that NEW Super Mario Bros Wii is an excellent addition to the Mario Universe and brings back the feelings of odd with the series.  The gameplay is excellent, being able to play with friends on these levels is a great experience (locally, though the lack of online co-op for this is questionable though not worthy of scrutiny) but doesnt leave people who have no one to play with lacking the ability to complete the game, and the presentation Nintendo offers us here in terms of music and graphics is worth its weight in gold.  For those who havent bought a Wii game since Super Smash Bros Brawl (yes there are a few of us) as well as for those who are looking for  an excellent single player and multiplayer experience on the Wii, New Super Mario Bros is a game to get.<br /><br />Note:  The Red case design and boxart is amazing and I hope Nintendo does more like it in the future

Fun for everyone...
I have to say, this is the most enjoyable game I've purchased in a long time...and I purchase a lot of games.<br /><br />While I have not yet finished the game, I believe I've played enough of it to give an accurate review.<br /><br />I purchased this game as a more family-oriented title, believing it to be something my wife (who has not played a video game since the Super Nintendo) might enjoy.  As I would describe myself as a "hardcore" gamer, I had low expectations as to how much I would get out of the game.  I was pleasantly surprised.  <br /><br />The true charm of Super Mario Bros. Wii is that it brings something for everybody to the table.  My wife enjoys the simplicity of the controls.  Her first observation was "I love it!  I can play a game with only two buttons."  I, on the other hand was happy to find the game to be fairly challenging, despite my wide range of experience with platformers.<br /><br />While the single-player mode is basically what you would expect from a Mario game...a challenging but straight-forward platformer, where the real excitement comes in is when you start up multiplayer.  With more than one player, Super Mario Bros. Wii will have you completely frustrated, yelling and laughing all at the same time.  Even if you have completed a level a dozen times in single-player mode, it becomes a completely different challenge when another player is on-screen, constantly getting in the way.  <br /><br />We find ourselves pausing at the beginning of a level to strategize exactly how we will attempt to get past a particularly daunting obstacle.  Should we both go at the same time and risk bumping into one another, or should one of us take the lead while the other holds back and waits?  Often the constant disarray devolves into a game of Super Smash Bros...we lose focus on completing the level and instead try to knock the other person to their death out of pure malice...content on completing the level individually after ridding the screen of the added obstacle, "Player 2".  Because of this, even the "Co-Op" game can become a competition of sorts.  <br /><br />In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game to "casual" and "hardcore" gamers alike...you will certainly get plenty of mileage out of it.  It's fun to play with friends, family, or alone and is challenging without being frustrating.

Best game that I own for the Wii
We've had a Wii for about 2 years now and have never had this much fun playing a game on this system.  Granted, we are not what you would call "gamers," but we do like to sit down and play some video games every now and then.  I bought this for my fiance because she's loves all things Super Mario.  She hasn't been able to put it down for longer than one day.  She talked me into playing multi-player with her and now I'm addicted and can't stop playing.<br /><br />The game is reminiscent of the Super Mario's from NES and Super Mario World, but with a few added twists/extras.  With this game you can get a penguin suit and you can shoot not only fire balls, but ice/snow balls at enemies...oh yea, Yoshi's back too!  There are also several challenges and mini-games throughout the game's levels that will keep the game relevant even after we beat it.  The thing I like best about this game is that you can have up to 4 players at once on the screen.  It gets a little chaotic, but is not overwhelming once you get the hang of it.  Multiplayer actually makes the game more exciting and fun for all.  <br /><br />I'm keeping this review as short as possible, so overall, get this game if you are looking for a good video game that is just pure fun.  I can think of one "flaw," and that is no online capability.  It would have been fun to play with some friends that are far away over wi-fi, but the game is still worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Enjoy!

if you liked any other mario game, buy this
I wouldn't bother going through and listing all the new features, since others have done that, but after playing through the first three worlds, I can tell you that this is  as fun or more fun as Mario3 of Super Mario World. Its got a little bit of each of these games and a little bit more. the new suits are great, and not at all gimicky. The super guide can help you when you get stuck, but it doesn't hurt the challenge since you have to choose to use it, and only after 8 deaths.<br /><br />The option for multiplayer is cool, although cooperative multiplayer makes some levels more challenging. I can't wait to try four player coin battle.<br /><br />although the graphics are 2d, they are bright and well rendered. A Mario platformer has never looked better. The music is great, and some of the koppas even dance in time to it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the wii remote is not quiet as ergonomic as the old SNES one. After hours playing it, my hands hurt a bit. But this game keeps me happily in front of the TV for hours

Fantastic game for any age!
Mario games are great games and this one is no different.  There are so many courses to complete & different worlds that the game will never get dull.  We got this for our 4.5 year old for Christmas & it has been a favorite of hers since.  We also own Mario Kart, which is a fabulous game as well.<br /><br />One of the things we like most about this game is you can sit down & play the game right out of the box.  This makes it possible to easily play with our 4.5 year old.  I think older kids & adults would find it very fun as well.  No, it's no Halo, but not every game needs to be like that one.  Super Mario Bros. doesn't need high-def graphics to make it a fun game.  The game itself is simply pure fun.

Who Doesn't Love Super Mario Bros.
I love this game. It's the original Mario game with a new age twist. I personally think it's awesome and totally fun. Great for family gatherings or just hanging around the house.

New Super Mario Bros Wii...Fantastic! More Please Nintendo!
This is a great game. I was apprehensive because it looked very similar to NSMBDS [a game I don't have, but the music and 'gist' was the same], But it's not. (I've heard someone say this is "2" - but I don't think it is either]. This is the sequel to Mario World*. Hands Down. [Spoilers below] <br /><br />Pros To Getting This Game:<br />1: it is really really fun.  The minute you enter the first world, you hear the re-vamped soundtracks, complete with bopping Goombas and dancing Koopas. <br /><br />2: Waggle Function thankfully kept to a minimum. <br /><br />3: Deliciously Hard. Not too hard that you want to throw your Wiimote across the room, but that special mix of "this should be so easy, I can get this, why is can't I do... OHHHhhhh" that you want in video games.<br /><br />4: Lack of "coasting: The one issue i HAD with Mario 3, and Mario World is that if you wanted, you can fly across the screen with a Pwing [M3] or with a Cape/Yoshi [World]. Not this time. PropellerMario has limited flight function, and while there is some Yoshi action - he stays behind while you move on.<br /><br />5: Return of the Koopalings: I always wondered where they went. <br /><br />6: Secrets Galore. There are several secret levels in a few worlds, matched up with secret exits where you couldn't BELIEVE where they are, and ... maybe.. other... secrets? to be found. <br /><br />7: SINGLE PLAYER FRIENDLY! If you don't have anyone to play with [such as I], do not fret. Nintendo made this as fun for 1 person as it clearly looks to be for 4. :)<br /><br />Cons. [not many]<br /><br />1: I would have liked t be able to play this as ANY character. You are locked as Mario [as a single player], and just by looking at 2/3 players you HAVE to be Mario. If they are going to go to the trouble of introducing 3 playable characters, at least let the player choose who they want to be at any stage of the game. <br /><br />2: Some of the secret hidden walls - a LOT secret. I know there is a way to tell; however, as someone who doesn't have NSMBDs.... not aware of them. Many of Lives were lost trying to find them.<br /><br />3: Super Guide: I don't like this concept of if you die a lot, you can have Luigi play it for you [you still have to play it yourself to count though]. It just symbolises: LOSER! to me.. (Yes I've triggered it. but i've never used it). <br /><br />4: Would have liked to have seen utalised the ability to use the classic controller. (of course, one can not waggle the classic controller - but, yeah, more games that lets you use it Nintendo would be great).<br /><br />So not a lot of cons. Honestly - pick this up and play it. If you have ANY reservations; rent it, but take my word for it, just buy it. <br /><br />I want to see more of these types of games, Nintendo... and maybe another Yoshi's Island WII!? :)

Great Game.  Brings back memories of the NES, SNES days
I bought this game yesterday from my local Sam's Club. My wife and I played it for hours.  If you liked the old school Mario side-scrollers, you will love this. It has everything that the old Mario games had with many improvements.  You can now play up to 4 players simultaneously.  There are a lot of parts where you need to work together to complete the level.<br /><br />The graphics are much improved and there are some great "Power-Ups" to gain.  Using the Wii-Mote as a controller is fine also.  You can use the nun-chuck attachment if you would like but the wii-mote by itself does the trick.  <br /><br />I would recommend this game to anyone as it is hours of fun for the whole family.

Awesome
I loved the original on SuperNintendo and equally love this version. It has great new features that make it fresh and a new game but still has the great basis from the original.

Awesome Game!
This game rocks! The graphics are great, the hint movies are awesome,and the Yoshis flail their tiny little legs to keep in the air! Although there's one thing I don't understand-in the start movie, when Mario, Lugi and the Toads are running out of the castle, Toad and his helpers shoot Peach's presents(in a cannon) out the window.???? Co-op is awesome, even if you're having a rough day, you can just pick up your trusty compainin and throw him off the edge. (It's great!)Or, if you're feeling helpful, you can let your friend jump on your head at the end of a level to reach the top point of the flag, which grants them an extra life! It's really fun to knock out Koopas when they're dancing, so that their shells end up upside down!This my final rating:<br /><br /><br /><br />                                            <br />      Graphics: Good<br />      Co-Op:AWESOME<br />      Music:Cool<br />      <br />Although there could be more then 99 lives (I made it there and wished for more lives) this game is great!

The Old Meets the New!!!
I just LOVE this game! It is, however, a recreation of the older games and even of the Nintendo DS game and the original Nintendo game, hince the name "Super Mario Bros. Wii." There is such a striking resemblance of the DS game until my son and I play both games side by side! Each of the worlds are similar - for example, the first world in both the DS and Wii version is a land version, while land 2 is a sand world, while the 3rd world is ice and so on. This is the only Wii game that I have become engaged in in some time. I play it almost everyday and even catch myself finding reasons to limit my son's play time so that I can play alone more! It made me nastalgic, I recalled my own childhood when we first got our own Nintendo. There is a way to get 99 men and my son - the KING OF ALL VIDEO GAMES EVER INVENTED - couldn't figure out how to get it, and I did! It was a blast! Now whenever he needs 99 men he calls ME to help him instead of vise versa. It's a great family game and that's why I love Nintendo!

Addictive!
This game is fun for all ages three to one hundred and three. Reminiscent of the super marios 1-3 and super mario world, it will please old school gamers and there is enough of a new twist to keep it challenging & fun for all gamers inexperienced and experienced. My whole family loves to play this game. I swear they should use this game as therapy for drug addicts, this game is more addictive than crack ;^D!  Run don't walk to get a copy of this awesome game you guys.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Fun game
Fun game.  A little hard for younger ones.  I have a 7 year old, who has had a hard time catching on.  She is catching on though.  I really like how four people can play at once.  If one person goes too far ahead of the others it kills them, so you have to work at staying together which adds an extra challenge to the game.  You can bring people back after they have died, which is also nice.  I would reccommend it.

Amazing Multi-Player Experience!
Many users have already commented on the New Super Mario Bros. game itself, but what I wanted to know before I purchased this game was how the multi-player experience worked out.  Obviously, four players can journey through each level at one time, but I have to say that the actual experience proved far more fun than I had anticipated.  <br /><br />What I find so ingenious about the multi-player experience is how thoroughly each player can affect one another while going through a level.  While you can't directly kill one another, you can block and push each other, shoot each other with shells, bounce off of each other's heads to go higher, steal each other's mushrooms and other bonuses, and even kill one another by moving so far ahead on the screen that another player gets scrolled off of it.  This essentially allows you to experience three different and incredibly fun multi-player experiences without adjusting any settings to the game:<br /><br />-Brawl style: Go through the levels with the primary goal of trying to eliminate each other.  This is tremendously fun as well as challenging.  <br /><br />-Every man for him/herself: A bit chaotic and often incredibly funny.  It's impossible not to get in each other's way when everyone is working for his/herself, and the little accidents that can happen along the way are often downright hysterical.<br /><br />-Cooperative style: My friends and I have had too much fun trying it the other ways, but it's clear that the game takes on a whole new shape is a team coordinates its efforts, using each other to jump higher, saving bonuses for each other, and carefully moving through the screen at the same pace.  I look forward to trying this once the fun of slaughtering one another begins to wane (which may never happen).<br /><br />All in all, New Super Mario Bros. introduces a very new and incredibly worthwhile open-ended multi-player experience.  I never imagined a four player side-scroller could work, but Nintendo has proven me wrong and then some.  Goodbye Mario Kart and Smash Bros.  My friends and I will be playing New Super Mario Bros. together for years to come.<br /><br />** Side note: When playing in four player mode, we've noticed some frusterating lag time that occurs several times per level.  If too much happens at once, the game freezes for a fraction of a second, which inevitably messes all of us up.  I have no idea whether this is caused by our specific Wii, our copy of the game, or if this is a defect in the game design, itself.  You get used to the lags after a while, but they seem absurdly unnecessary in this age of console gaming.

Two Words: Multiplayer Mayhem
I've been a long time gamer, and remember the good old days even back with Super Mario Bros. For me, this game was going to be a must-have.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed this game. For those who have played Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World, the feel of the game is identical, and it adds so much more to the table. It also mixes in elements from other Mario games.<br /><br />First of all, the environments are well done. The design of the levels are innovative and bring some freshness to the game. From trying to stay on moving, rotating blocks, to riding atop massive manta rays, to narrowly avoiding giant spiked pillars that smash into walls, to riding a skeleton dragon roller coaster, the levels designs showcase amazing creativity.<br /><br />The basics of the control scheme will be familiar to those who've played Super Mario before. The controller is held sideways, the 2 Button is jump, the 1 Button is dash, which you also use to hold things or to throw fire/ice balls. In addition, you can also spin the Wii Remote to do a spin jump. If you want to pick up something heavy, you just hold the 1 Button and spin the Wii Remote. The first few times when you can spin the Wii Remote to do something, a nice little reminder will appear above your character.<br /><br />In this game, they've also added in some new and interesting power ups. In addition to a number of familiar power ups, such as the fire flower and mini mushroom, there's the ice flower, the propeller suit, and the penguin suit. I did like these new power ups, but I personally would like to have seen some more.<br /><br />The difficulty of the game starts off pretty low, but the game does get harder as you go along. Some of the later levels definitely require an added measure of patience. Also, some of the later boss battles are just cheap (For example, three moving platforms with the boss always occupying one, and a pit below - I fell off and died a few times even after beating the boss!).<br /><br />Where this game really shines is in its multiplayer. As you know (and if you don't, you should), this game sports multiplayer in a new and longly anticipated way for a Mario game. You're able to play through levels with four players co-operatively. There's a couple of modes you can also play to battle each other with, but I'll just focus on the co-op. Trust me when I tell you that this is one of those games where every time you play it with friends, you bust up laughing at something someone does. The multiplayer is by far the best feature of the game. Without it, it's "just" another Mario game (though a pretty good one, all the same).<br /><br />With the multiplayer, all mayhem breaks loose. Playing this game, I've been known to chuck people off the edge, use others to attack enemies, throw someone into an enemy if they steal all the power ups, bounce on someone's head to garner enough height to make it to a ledge, pick up someone to carry them through a section, and so on. It's amazing fun, especially when you have more people.<br /><br />In multiplayer, things act a little differently. First of all, in most cases, when you hit a ? block, that contains a power up, there will be enough power ups for everyone. Another thing is if someone goes down a pipe or through a door, after a few moments, even if no one else has gone there, it will go to that part of the level. Also, if someone dies, they immediately loose a life, and after a few seconds will appear back on screen in a bubble that needs to be popped (If they lose their last life, then they won't come back until you return to the level select screen. once there, they'll start back up with five lives). In addition, if you come up to a harder section, they can hit A to turn into a bubble retaining their power up until someone pops them out again. Be warned on that, though, if everyone either dies or is in a bubble, you will get booted out of the level.<br /><br />It's also entertaining to play levels meant for one person with up to four people. For example, playing alone, let's say there's a platform that you have a little room to move on. Now, imagine that same platform with four people on it. People are bouncing off of each other, others have picked up someone and -oops, one of them let go of the 1 Button and just killed that person, but they'll be coming back in a bubble soon. Who ever thought that it could get so crowded!<br /><br />All around, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a great game with classic gameplay, innovative levels, and most notably multiplayer madness. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great game on the Wii.

Mario Brothers just keep getting better
I grew up playing the old games on the 80's Nintendo machines and love that the old classics are still coming out with something new.  The newer games with their amazingly realistic animation, story lines and crazy amounts of strategy to get you from level to the next are great, but for me, nothing beats the old school classics.  When I can introduce my kids to an updated version of my old favorites, and they actually want to play it again, I'm happy.

A great game overall
I recently purchased Wii Sports Resort along with the included Wii Motion Plus, and it has been an excellent game so far. Included are 12 games, 10 of which are new and two of which are updates to the classic Wii Sports games- golf and bowling.<br /><br />Starting with the updates, I feel that Wii Motion Plus adds a lot to the gameplay for the golf game. More sensitive controls make it far more challenging endeavor, adding somewhat to the realism of the game. Also, I find that it is a lot more enjoyable to swing the club in this game than it was in the original. In bowling, it is much easier to add a spin to the ball. Of the additions, I would say that archery and swordplay are standouts, and I wouldn't be surprised if they make it into other Nintendo releases (i.e. Zelda). The game captures the illusion of actually playing with swords or a bow-and-arrow really well. I also really enjoyed most of the water sports, especially power cruising, which reminded me of Wave Race. Some of the sports, on the other hand, are less satisfying, such as cycling, since pedaling with your arms does not feel natural.<br /><br />The Wii has seen a lot of "waggle-fests" released, and the nice thing about including Wii Motion Plus is that it really improves the motion-sensing fidelity of the Wiimote. I hope more games use this accessory in the future. For some of the multiplayer events, you may need to purchase additional copies of Wii Motion Plus (or get it bundled with another game), while others simply allow you to pass one Wii remote around. The graphics of the game are simple and colorful, and the game features nice water effects.<br /><br />However, here are a few aspects of the game that I wish were better. Although this game has more depth than the original Wii Sports, with more games, multiple game play modes, and achievements, I still wish that there was some additional depth to some of the games (i.e. more courses, objectives, etc.), especially considering how enjoyable some of the activities are. Some people found that the original Wii Sports did not have sufficient depth, and those individuals may be disappointed. Also, it would have been nice to have online play for this game, since the game really seems to shine in multiplayer, and it is not always easy to find others to play.<br /><br />Overall, I think that most people who enjoyed Wii Sports will similarly enjoy Wii Sports Resort.

Wii Sports Resort is a vacation for the whole family!
Wii Sports Resort, which was released in stores this past Sunday, 7/26, is a delightful spin on the Wii Sports favorite.  There are 12 fun activities in this game and it comes with the special attachment, Wii Motion Plus, which you snap into the bottom of the Wii-mote for a better playing experience.<br /><br />The Wii Motion Plus sensor is better at picking up your subtlest movements than the Wii-mote by itself.  This makes for less frustration and easier game-play.  With longer use though, the Wii Motion Plus sensor may lose calibration and won't be as sensitive to your movements.  There is an easy fix, though.  All you have to do is pause the game and set your Wii-mote down on a flat surface for it to re-calibrate.  This shouldn't take much longer than five seconds to right itself.  The more sensitive sensor works great in games like Bowling, (which is back in this game in an updated version), because you can get a better spin on your throw.  However, it can also work against you in games like Golf, (which is also back and updated), since you actually have to swing straight and even, like a real golf club, or you will have a serious angle to your strike.  No more flicks of the wrist in this golf game!<br /><br />The game opens with an adorable, interactive sky-diving movie where you meet up with all of your past Miis.  Once you get to the main menu, you will see the plethora of games that lie before you, however not everything is unlocked yet.  You have to earn certain scores to unlock different modes of certain games.  This is akin to Wii Sports' Training section, where each sport had three different modes you could try out.  Below is a brief synopsis of the mini-games included in Wii Sports Resort.<br /><br />Cycling--this can get a bit frustrating in two person mode.  Both of you have to try to pedal in unison to keep your energy up and depending on which way you tilt the Wii-mote depends on which way your wheels will turn.  So you really have to make an effort to work together!  But it can be hysterical when you don't!<br /><br />Sky-Diving--this is really cute.  You have to try to link up with as many people as possible.  The minute you link up with someone, the shutter on a camera will start timing you for a picture.  Every person you hook up with re-sets the camera's shutter.  Once you hook up with four people, it's considered "perfect", and the camera will take your picture.  You have to make sure that everyone's faces are looking at the camera for maximum points.  After a few rounds of this, it will conclude with you trying to hook up with everyone in the air for a huge finish.<br /><br />Basketball--the initial game is a basic dunking game, trying to see how many balls you can dunk before the timer runs out.  Once you have reached a certain score, you will unlock a 3 on 3 pick-up game, which is a lot of fun.  You can jump up in the air and block people's shots as well as steal the ball away from the other team.<br /><br />Canoeing--this one seemed to be the hardest of the mini-games, especially in two-player mode.  Like cycling, this relies heavily on both of you moving in sync to get as far as you can in the canoe course.<br />Waverunning--in this game, you are on a jet ski and your points are calculated by the stylish jumps you can do.<br /><br />Frisbee--there are two exciting versions of Frisbee.  The first one you get to play with a very cute dog.  You throw the Frisbee as close as you can to the center of the bulls-eye and where the dog catches it determines where it lands.  This gets increasingly challenging, as you later on have to pop a balloon and try to hit the bulls-eye for maximum points.  After you reach a certain score in this game, you will unlock Frisbee Golf, which is a ton of fun.  You have a choice of three Frisbees designed like golf clubs and you play Frisbee within the rules of Golf.<br /><br />Swordplay--this is great fun.  The game plays like the tv show "American Gladiators" in that you have to knock your opponent off of the board to win.  Later on, you can unlock other games like a one-player mode where you try to hit as many people as you can, forming as high of a combination as you can, without getting hit three times.  This is a great game for getting out aggression and would be surreal with a light saber attachment.<br /><br />Archery--the fun of this mini-game lies in its challenge.  Not only do the targets get further and further away, but you have to work with the wind mileage also, (like in Golf).<br /><br />There is so much to do in this game, yours truly hasn't even unlocked everything yet and I've owned the game for two days!  This is definitely an improvement on Wii Sports, if even for the Wii Motion Plus alone.  There is much more of a challenge in this game, since you aren't handed everything from the beginning and you have to unlock most of the modes.  There are so many things to do in this game, it is guaranteed to please.  Even the old favorites of Golf and Bowling have been made more interesting.  The 100-pin mode that you had to build up to in Wii Sports is a 10-frame game in this version.  And Golf includes the classic boards from Wii Sports, or you can play on the newly designed Wii Sports Resort green!  Bottom line, if you enjoyed Wii Sports, you should definitely consider picking this up.

great fun with a big bonus of caloric burn!
I love Wii games.<br />I love Wii fitness games.<br />Granted, no one is saying this is a fitness game...you will want it because its FUN but...<br /><br />While this is most assuredly tops in player fun, even if you are as thin as you ever wanna be and don't count a single calorie and don't buy it for anything but to have fun...but if you happen to be like the majority of Americans you are gonna get one great unexpected bonus to really fun play: BIG calorie burn. Whether you want to or not your body will MOVE and that makes it all the more fun anyway! You are totally engrossed in play!<br /><br />I wear a bodybugg to accurately measure my daily calorie burn. I mention this only because my statement isn't an assumption or that it "felt" like my heart rate was up...I wasn't even thinking of it as a workout the first time I played. But I played my first few games for 30 minutes, looked down at my wrist display...and I'd burned as much as I do with my workout dvds!! But I didn't care...I wasn't playing it for that...this game is GRAND! In fact, I wouldn't have stopped so soon had it not been hijacked by my honey. I took it back over as soon as I could and, with the other games, got the same results. Big fun. Big caloric burn. It's truly two in one. We've both laughed and "wooo hoooed!" and had a blast with the games. This one doesnt feel rushed in the designers planning and putting it together...there are not only tons of games (you unlock more as you improve) but they are so "full" of action and stimulus that it will fast become a favorite in any Wii collection, no doubt.<br /><br />First, you'll begin to see the wonder of the Wii motionplus as you are dropped into the island via parachute...start playing with the controller right then and you'll witness the difference in it truly tracking your movement in supreme accuracy and time over the old remote. The cost of the Wii motionplus isnt' cheap so for it to be included in the game is a bonus because, to me, the game alone was worth the price. You know how, before the motionplus, you'd wanna yell at the tv "Hey! that's now what I was doing!" when you did one move but your mii did another? The motionplus will morph true time and reality with what you are actually doing with the remote. I've been blown away in all games in which I've tried it.<br /><br />Then pick one of the many games offered for fun play on your island vacation adventure here. The detail and accuracy of every one of this could bear witness to too long of a review if I went into each one but they can't go without mention...for example, you won't just wakeboard through the ocean, you'll pass cruise liners and hear the passengers aboard cheer for you if you do a smooth jump as you pass by, you'll pass by islands, see birds and hear them and the waves will crash around you in both sound and visual.  You'll see the Wii blimp fly by... so the accuracy of visual game play surrounds you while the game takes you in by feeling as though you really are behind a boat and seeing that what you do with your remote as your wakeboard handle changes the game play...do jumps in the air, try to land smoothly, become a wakeboard God...<br /><br />...but here's the thing...for those who care...while you don't realize it, you are getting your heart rate up and doing ab moves! The same moves I used to jump the wakes twisting my arms and body are the same I do in my core workouts! You just don't even think about it much until you watch someone else do it and see what you've burned!<br /><br />Wanna play basketball? Twisting your body to bend down, grab a ball and then throw it through the hoop gets your same ab moves workin and your arms moving for great cardio. But few would even notice that. BUT IS IT FUN? HECK YEAH! I don't care if you don't care at all about fitness every game is so detailed in all you can do, unlock, and accuracy with the motionplus that it's just filled with visual and physical and mental stimulus that makes it way beyond addictive for this household! Unexpectedly though...you may just wind up with some MUSCLE.<br /><br />Wanna swordfight? You'll burn calories like upper body kickboxing moves but you'll have a blast knocking your opponent off a platform, hearing drum beats, the roar of the crowd then slicing through other objects with your sword in other games.<br /><br />The crowd is so in tuned to what you do in every game that you'll even hear them count for you sometimes when numbers matter. This doesn't sound canned...YOU FEEL like you have a live audience.<br /><br />The graphics stand out throughout the game to bring each game to life...take bowling, for example, you see the sheen on the polished wooden floor and wood grain and feel like you are truly in a real bowling alley within your livingroom because of the sound and graphics and accurate movement to bowling.  The camera pans in as your ball moves, and their is always color, movement, and crowd noise through each game..<br /><br />..even more than crowd cheering, there are visual clues in the games as well. Such as when, in basketball, you break your record, fireworks explode before you. Unlock the full out basketball game and you may even smack your face on the court when you fall.<br /><br />After every game you'll see how you did and your results or awards.<br /><br />this is made to be a game but beats the heck out of any of the other Wii fitness games on the market because you just have so much fun and expend an incredible amount of energy doing it just is a side bonus you don't even think about whereas the others are fitness with a little bit of fun as a side bonus...this just feels like PLAY.<br /><br />Take cycling, you'll furiously move your hands up and down but feel competitive to beat the other bikers, hear your pedals and gears, ride over rocks but through mountains and water and trees then hit the city and see patio cafes and hear the wind and take sips from your water bottle. it's amazing all that goes on while you just play!  Petal too hard? Your head turns red and starts throbbing! So much going on in every game...<br /><br />We have been playing non-stop and have yet to have found a game we could deem unfun. I kid you not.<br /><br />I always try to end every review with a negative. I feel no product is perfect. For the game, I wracked my brain and couldn't come up with one so I'll add that I wish it had a second motionplus. you don't want to play it without it and if you have someone else in your house watching you play this game, they will no doubt hijack it within minutes or whine a whole bunch. (UPDATE: At the time of my review, they had no game that came with 2 motionplus'.  I recently saw one in a store that had 2 motionplus attachments inside the game so they are out there if needed. Also, since it's been awhile since the release of this game since my review, people may be already getting some motionplus add-ons in games so that this is no longer much of an issue.)<br /><br />CONCLUSION: My favorite Wii game. What more can I say? Jam packed with games, ease of figuring out how to play each one, extreme visual and auditory realism AND GI-NORMOUS FUN. and sssssh, it'll just happen to burn the heck outta what you ate for lunch.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Orignal Wii sports fun but with more games!
I picked this game up this morning at game crazy and im going to have to say its one of the funnest games ive played for the nintendo wii!  Its just as amazing as Wii sports if you enjoyed that and theres more games to enjoy!<br />A list of the different games:<br /><br />Wake boarding<br />Archery<br />Frisby<br />Bowling<br />jet skiing<br />Basketball <br />Cycling<br />Canoeing<br />Parachuting<br />Sword fighting - My favorite<br />Ping Pong<br />and golf!<br /><br />Most of the games have unlockable extras like frisby starts with you throwing to a dog then it unlocks frisby golf.  I haven't tried most of the extra's yet but im sure there just as fun!.  Most games either have 2 extra games that are unlockable or different difficulty levels such as Beginner,Intermediate, and Pro. <br /><br /> If you liked the original Wii sports try this it was loads of fun 5 stars!

Another game we will play for as long as we own the wii
I bought two copies -- one for my mother for her birthday and one for my family.  All of us (5 adults, 3 kids) love it!  My 80+ old grandmother loves the bowling game.  My parents, both in their 60s, love several of the games and are still exploring all of the offerings on the disc.  My husband, a good friend and I have played it every night since we bought it.  Our group of three loves to play the sword duels, archery, frisbee dog, frisbee golf, and dog (plane) fights.  My husband and I currently find ourselves strangely addicted to the island flyover game.  That's where you fly a little prop plane (a cessna?) all over the islands looking for "i" points or shooting balloons.  It is so peaceful and yet it compells you to keep looking until you have found all the hidden items.  What I like about Wii Resort more than Wii Sports (and I love that game too) is that it adds a layer of competition and re-playability with the addition of "stamps."  When you accomplish certain feats within the game (you may think of them as side quests), then you may earn a stamp.  Some stamps are more difficult than others to earn.  For example, in bowling, you can earn a stamp by picking up a certain type of split.  Another stamp requires you to bowl a perfect game to earn it (my father-in-law has done it).  Earning stamps has been a fun addition for us.<br /><br />We are still exploring other games.  Some are definitely more fun than others.  I'm sure that there will be one or two games that we won't like at all (I'm thinking specifically about water boarding here).  However, the archery, frisbee and flight games are worth the price of the game alone.  Bowling is always fun, plus there's ping pong and golf.  More than enough to love and balance out any stinkers.<br /><br />Motion Plus Note:  This game comes with one Motion Plus.  You must have a Motion Plus to play, a regular remote won't work.  Some games allow multiple players to share a single remote, so you don't have to buy a second (or third or fourth) Motion Plus right away.  However, there are some games that can only be played by two or more people at the same time and you must have a Motion Plus for each player.  There are three regular players in my house and we played happily for a week with only one Motion Plus.  Now we play with two and I don't see an immediate need to get any more.<br /><br />In short, I think the Wii system has succeeded in doing exactly what it set out to do -- to make gaming fun for everyone and to bring people together and get them off the couch.  Wii Resort is the perfect example of that success.

Excellent Follow Up to Wii Sports
Having only played this game for a day now, I can tell you my entire family is having a blast with it, just as we did when the Wii first launched.  There is a more robust selection of 12 "sports", from things like sword fighting and table tennis, to water and air sports, and even revamped favorites like golf and bowling.  Only a few games since launch have garnered as much positive reaction from game fans of all ages as the Wii Sports franchise, mostly due to the universal appeal of real life sports games.  <br /><br />The second high point of this title is the bump in graphics, mostly gone are the jaggies that plagued the launch titles for the Wii, and these are on par with the system's best like Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime 3.  Effects such as waves, splashes of water, air currents, and even lighting and human interaction look better than ever, and the vivid colors really take the 480p resolution of the Wii to its limits.<br /><br />Of course, no review of this game would be complete without mentioning its biggest leap forward, Wii Motion Plus.  This simple looking attachment is really a tiny gyroscope that rotates inside its shell for full 360 degrees of detection, for true 1:1 motion controls (or as close as this system will get).  It provides so much more control, while adding barely anything to its length, and for those opposed to the Wii condom included with every remote now, yes, the attachment is removable, and even fits over the 3rd party covers my friends and family have been using since system launch.  I can only look forward with anticipation to the next generation of titles to come in the following years, as they will be a big leap forward for Nintendo fans, and WM+ keeps this system in line with motion controls being developed by the other two big console manufacturers.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a hardcore, or even casual Wii fan, do not hesitate to pick up Wii Sports Resort.  It is the finest game released on disc for this system in 2009, and will appeal to game fans of all ages and genders.  A true resort experience for the entire family.

Up and Running!
Off the top I must admit I am paralyzed from the chest down and use a wheelchair for mobility.  So I'm looking for Wii games that are fun, competitive and get your heart rate up without requiring "happy feet."  I had high hopes for Wii Fit but they were dashed.  Wii Resort, however, has been GREAT.  I can Sword Play with my granddaughter.  Kayaking has given me an ab workout that is almost impossible to find in a way that's "fun."  Both cycling and wave-running are real challenges for me.  <br /><br />Now I realize that an endorsement from a grandma in a wheelchair is like the kiss of death for a video game,but the fact that I'm competitive with my son, the granddaughters and my husband lets me play with my family again.  In fact, I catch them "practicing" when I'm not there so Noni doesn't beat them.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that there are many other games that suit players from 8 to 80, give everyone a workout and are even fun for the spectators.  My family has threatened to charge admission to my Wii boxing (from the original Wii Sports) and Wii Kayaking rounds.<br /><br />You'd be nuts not to add this one to your Wii collection!!

The Greatest
We have 10 grandchildren.  I never played a video game in my life.  I am an old retired doc who was 'married" to medicine.  I got a WII and now have 4 of all the different kinds of remotes and @6-7 games.  I play it which for an old curmudgeon like me is something special.  The best was last night when we had 4 little ones playing at once.  My wife and I watched them and were so happy we almost cried.  We have a 58 inch plasma TV and even though it is not HD we could give a hoot as everything is so cool.  My advice is for all grandparents to get one of these and especially this game and get prepared to have the best times.

Wii Sports Resort!
So this game is awesome!  Theres 12 different sports/games on Wii Sports Resort but unlike original Wii Sports so have alot of choices once you chose the sport you want to play, example: I want to play Swordplay, I can choose Duel, Speed Slice, or Showdown.  Other ones have different choices, some have Beginner, Intermediate, etc.  It keeps it from getting boring since you have so many choices.  Now I'll talk alittle about the different games.<br /><br />Swordplay: When I looked at the games that would be on Wii Sports Resort I thought that Swordplay would be a stupid game but really I love it!  It's fun and pretty easy.  You can do Duel which is just against one other person but theres also Speed Slice where you have to slice all kind of different items certain ways and faster than your opponent. <br /><br />Wakeboarding: This is just water-skiing.  It's pretty fun and I don't really know what to say about it.<br /><br />Frisbee: This one is fun, you have to start out to just throwing the frisbee to a dog (theres like a target area you have to throw within for the dog to catch it).  But, even better is Frisbee Golf.  Its like golf but with the frisbee and its fun.  And its just like real frisbee because you do it just like your throwing a real frisbee.<br /><br />Archery: At first I had a hard time doing this one, but now I'm doing alot better and its more fun than I originally thought.  Its just like real archery...thats all I have to say.<br /><br />Basketball: I think this ones hard so I haven't really done much with it yet.<br /><br />Table Tennis: I like this one alot too, its almost just like tennis from original Wii Sports but of course its on a ping-pong table.<br /><br />Golf: This is kind of an upgrade of the original Wii Sports golf.  You have to make sure you swing straight.  But I think its easier than the original.<br /><br />Bowling: This is also an upgrade of the original Wii Sports bowling.  I think its harder so I think I'll stick with the original.<br /><br />Power Cruising: This is just jet-skiing.  You have to do the slalom, which is fun.  You need 2 people to do a race though, which I wish the computer could just be the opponent but it doesn't let that happen.<br /><br />Canoeing: When I first saw this game I knew I really wanted to try this one.  It took me alittle bit to get the hang of it but after I that I loved it.<br /><br />Cycling: This ones alot of fun too, you have all kinds of places you can race around.<br /><br />Air Sports: In this one there is Skydiving which you just sky dive but you have to link up with other players and after a certain amount of time it takes a pictures, you get a better score for the more people you have in the picture and if you can see your smile.  You can also drive a plane around.<br /><br />Thats the 12 games.  Now the Wii Motion Plus really REALLY makes a difference.  Theres so many little thing it detects and it makes the game so much more fun...alot of this games wouldn't be as fun without it!

A sequel that tops the original..
I picked this game up today, and so far, I really like it!  I normally don't write a review so quickly, but this game will only get better and better.  Certainly worth every penny.<br /><br />A lot like Wii Sports in the graphics, sound and overall feel. The graphics are better, and more fun the the original. You'll hear the same voices, you'll get points to get to Pro level, and your other Mii's will show up in the background, just like in the original.  You get basic games, as well as unlocking alternate versions of the games.  For example, after you play bowling, you'll unlock 100 pin bowling.  Other fun extras include being able to choose from a few different golf courses. <br /><br />I was disappointed at first to see bowling and golf, why repeat those games? Once you play it with the new motion control, you'll see why. I'll never play Wii Sport golf again. It's so much more responsive, especially in putting. Same with bowling, making it a MUCH more challenging game!! I think people will love the updated versions.  <br /><br />I honestly thought the Motion control was just a new marketing trick to sell more accessories, but it truly does make a difference.  If you've ever played Wii Play table tennis, it pales in comparison to the Wii Sports version.  It's much more fun, it's much more accurate in movement.  The motion control detects not only left to right, top to bottom, but inward and outward.  Giving it a more realistic feel.  <br /><br />I've also played a lot with the sword play games, archery, frisbee, table tennis, and wakeboard.  All very fun! I played for over an hour, and only played half the games.  I think it has some good replay value. Not something you'll get tired of in a month. I already can't wait to get back to it! <br /><br />My only complaint so far is basketball, a game that I'm terrible at in real life. That tells you just how accurate this new motion control is! haha  With some practice it will be a lot of fun too, I'm sure.  As with any game, there will games you enjoy less then others, but with so many to pick from, it's sure to please a variety of Wii fans.<br /><br />You'll certainly have to retrain yourself in the way you play Wii, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be addicted!  Many times, sequels just can't come close to the original, but I do think Wii Sports Resort is the exception.

A great follow up to Wii Sports!
Wii Sports Resort is a great follow up to Wii Sports!  <br /><br />Pros:<br />Level of activity--Unlike another reviewer who said couch potatoes will love some of these games, I've found they all get you moving to some degree.  Sure you can sit to do some of them if you want to but that was true of Wii Sports also.  They're as active as you want to make them.  You'll feel the effort on all--even the water sports where you're using just your arms.  Your arms and upper body will feel it!<br /><br />Variety of games--There is something for everyone.  You'll have favorites (mine are Wakeboarding, Table Tennis and Swordplay) and others that you don't love as much (I'm as bad at Basketball as I am in real life and I'm lukewarm on Power Cruising) but there are games that will appeal to everyone in the household based on age, ability and likes.  I won't list them all because other reviewers have.<br /><br />Wii Motion Plus--I have to say that for some games I don't feel the nuances.  For others, however, I definitely feel the difference.  In Bowling, the ball response to what you're doing with your hand and wrist is much more realistic.  It makes the game even better although more challenging and adds a new dimension.<br /><br />Fun even by yourself--There are more games that are fun to play by yourself than in Wii Sports because of the nature of the games.  Like Wii Sports, it tracks your level/status as you work towards Pro, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />No online play--It would have been great to be able to compete online and have tournaments and rankings like in MarioKart.<br /><br />Additional Wii Motion Plus needed--You will want a WM+ for every player's remote.  The good news is that some of the games allow remote sharing so this is only necessary if you want to do competitive play on certain games.<br /><br />Lack of depth--As mentioned by others, I wish some of the games had even more options or depth. <br /><br />Overall:<br />Wii Sports Resort is a great game to have!  If you like Wii Sports then this game will be one of the classics that you pull out regularly.  The only reason I rated it four stars for fun is because not all the games will be a blast for everyone.<br />

Totally Awesome!
Much improved over the original Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resort takes Wii gaming fun to a whole new level.  With 12 Events instead of 5, you get some really fun and deep games.  My personal favorite has to be the sword fighting (kendo?), which can get very intense.  The controls for every game in here is obviously very well thought out, and feels quite natural.  Wii motion plus absolutely added a whole dimension of accuracy to the gameplay.  About the only mini-game that didn't feel like it had motion-plus accuracy was maybe bowling, but it was at least as good as the original, so not really a minus.   Highly recommended for anyway who has a wii, and especially if you enjoyed the original Wii sports (even just a little bit).

Tremendous fun with friends/family or alone!
This game is flat out fun and awesome!  <br /><br />My wife received it as a gift for her birthday and we have not stopped playing it since.  In fact, we have had over twenty people playing at a party one afternoon and night (ages ranged from 23 to 87) and every loved it. (grandma even rolled a strike her first time playing 100-pin bowling).  The last three days we have had friends and family come over for Wii Sports Resorts action and nobody wants to go home! (it's cool because we now have all our friends and family as Mii's on our console).<br /><br />We bought an extra Wii Motion Plus so we can go head-to-head on some games but many games allow you to share one controller between 4 players (turn based games like bowling, golf, frisbee and archery).<br /><br />There are twelve distinct games in Wii Sports Resort and within them are several different modes.  Standouts for me are:<br /><br />Swordplay:  Three modes (VS, Speed Slice, and Showdown)...showdown is my favorite, you face a hoard of Mii's rushing you and you have to go 'Conan' on them.<br /><br />Frisbee:  Love the Frisbee Dog (accuracy competition...I play a few rounds after a stressful day at work and it's very relaxing, and the challenge is tall because it's tough to keep building on your high scores)<br /><br />Archery:  Great fun with the nunchuck, use the remote as the Bow and the nunchuck to knock your arrow and pull back on the string.  You shoot at targets at increasing range..very challenging.<br /><br />Bowling:  So far I've only played 100-Pin...that's bowling with 100 pins...how cool is that (especially when you get a strike and knock them all down)<br /><br />Air Sports:  Flying and Skydiving....Flying is very low key, you pilot an airplane (solo, but there is a two-player dog-fight mode) and are challenged to visit 80 points of interest on the island (some require you fly through caves 'in' the island).  Skydiving is also low-key and fun...the challenge is to link up mid-air with other skydivers so you can have your photo taken, turn to face the camera to show smiling faces for more points. At the end you get to see the photos of you and all your friends from the jump.<br /><br />Issues:  Having read some unfavorable reviews I'd like to give you my take.<br /><br />Controller calibration:  For the most part we have had no serious problems, although it's true, after some time and wild play, the calibration gets a little wonky.  This is easily fixed by either pointing the remote at the screen and press the D-button (direction button at the front of the remote) or press the '+' button and set the remote on a flat surface for ten seconds so the gyros can settle down.<br /><br />Graphics:  They are on par with many Wii games like Wii Fit, Wii Play, Wii Sports..etc...The Wii is not under any circumstance going to look like a PS3 hooked to a HD TV.  Could the graphics on Wii Sports Resort be more detailed, probably (some games your Mii only has hands holding the sword or paddle but no arms), but as it is, they are good graphics and the game play is smooth and fast considering all the physics models programed in for each game.  Personally, I'd sacrifice top-end graphics for a fun game that runs and plays smooth<br /><br />I am totally satisfied and love this game as much as Mario Kart Wii (my other favorite).  It's tons of fun, especially with friends (which is why I love Wii more than PS3 or XBox, much more multi-player/family oriented and shared fun is always the best in my book).<br /><br />I think this game will be a solid addition to your library especially if you have people to enjoy it with.

My Wii Excerise
The Wii Sports Resort is a great set of games.  I originally played this game at a relatives home and instantly fell in love with it.  I have some mobility issues and when I tried out some of these games I realized I was able to get up and move around without a ton of effort, and all the while I was having a blast.  I went home and bought myself a Wii system shortly after that and this was the first game I sought to buy.  Mainly because it has several games within the one.  I love playing all of the games, they are great fun.  I've heard some people complain about the graphics and although I somewhat agree that in this age of technology you would think the graphics would be more advanced but for a video game I think you can adjust to it.  It does take a couple of rounds of any one of the games to get the feel for the controler in that particular game but once you play them a bit you'll get the feel for each one.  <br /><br />This game is well worth it's price because it gives you several games within it to keep you busy for hours.  I give it a solid thumbs up!

beats the free one
This is definately a must have if you like the free sports game you have to own this, plus it comes with motion plus for your controller a great deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fun game to play against others
I really liked the Sports that came with my Wii, but Sports Resort is much better...mainly because of the Motion Plus.  The only 2 games that are the same from Sports are bowling and golf.  With bowling and golf in Resort, you have SO much more control over what your ball is doing.  Not only do you have more ball control, you have more to do within each game.  bowling has a 100 pin game and a game where you have to bowl around blocks to hid the pins behind them.  In golf, you can choose different courses and if you wanted to play 3, 9 or 18 hole games.  This game (like most other games out there) it's more fun to play against your friends or family instead of solo.<br /><br />I don't have many games for my Wii, but I have traded in a few that I didn't like to buy this one.  This one is a keeper for sure.<br /><br />Sports = Fun<br />Sports Resort = Fun x2<br />Play = Avarage<br />Guitar Hero = Fun<br />Party Games 2 = Not good<br />Carnival Games = Really bad

Competition
Wii sports was a good showcase of the system. Resort takes that, flips it on its head, and gets you to have FUN with so much more control integration...but....there is an added level of competition here that is defiant throughout your resort vacation. Every game, imo, gets very, very competitive in a way that wii sports 1 never reached due to the basic who can waggle better (?). Prepare to sweat, prepare your curse words, prepare to be very angry at your oppenents!! Instead of listing what is bad and good, ill just list the games that are more or less ehhh<br /><br />Fencing seems great at first, and you are wowed by the coolness, however, after many matches against people of all skill levels - this game is NOT waggle-proof. The hardest wagglers (like my gf) will win almost all the time, no matter what skill level you are. A straight waggle fest dominates this game, which is a bit dissapointing. There is a defensive counter attack, but a very hard determined waggler can break through it!<br /><br />Wave Running - in theory cool, but keeping the boat going straight is an issue<br /><br />Canoeing - Cool, again, getting the boat on your intended course is difficult, when you switch sides to steer, sometimes the game does not recognize it, but wow WHAT A WORK OUT<br /><br />The rest of the games...are...AWESOME. The graphical presentation is up 10 fold, the subtle music is cool and not annoying, but the best are the signature Nintendo'd sound effects that make every game addicting and unique.<br /><br />I will conclude and say this is a MUST BUY by any means, whether you play alone or with friends, this game is so much fun, and highly competitive, with 2+ player modes abound, and different variations (playing against eachother, or, playing collectively, unlocking bonus modes/activities) For [...] bucks, cant beat it, and its a must have, with almost perfect controls in every game, a few games are a little lackluster, but still fun.<br /><br />Wii Sports Resort has made Wii Sports 1 into a game of SKILL, and your abilities in the game will be tested against your oppenents which makes for one heck of a competitive fun fest. Pure Nintendo, pure fun, and you will be sweating!!

Great Addition to our Game Collection
Wii Sports Resort is a great addition to our Wii Games.  I'm selective at which games I buy because my kids lose interest fast.  Games with variety are the best in our house.  My son (7) loves the sword fighting and watersports.   My daughter (10) likes archery, frisbee, and one of the airplane games.   My husband - an advid hunter - likes the archery.  There is something for everyone.  It was a good mid-Summer addition to our routine.  It changed things up and got the kids off the couch.   Worth the investment.   I would recommend!

Addicted
Sports Resort is addictive.  Features about 12 games - swordplay, frizbee, jet ski, water surfing, sky diving, cycling, basketball shooting, table tennis, golf, bowling and a couple other which escapes my memory at the moment.  They'll good fun and most have a couple options, for example the swordplay features duel (one-on-one challenge - best of three), quick slice (one-on-one who slices in the correct direction the fastest - win ten to win the game) and showdown (single player challenge - take on the other Miis take three hits = game over).<br />Its all fun whether you play on your own or challenge a friend or two.

Works great
Okay, first off, if you are going to compare this with playing the real sport...stop!  It's a video game and that's how it plays like.  So say "I play tennis and it's nothing like the real thing"  Duh!  For those of you complaining about the calibration on sword fighting, I have noticed it too, but not as bad as you make it out to be.  It works well and yes I did too have to calibrate after sometime, but I only had to do that on the sword fighting, the other 11 games seemed to work great.  And for those people that said that this should have come free with Wii or with the game.  Please...does Nintendo owe you free stuff when they come out with it?  No, if you want it...buy it, if not, then don't.  Simple.  They are a business to make money and that is what they are going to do...and you know what, they are doing a great job of it too.  Lastly, for the few that said it's not the easiest thing to put on and take off.  It's not that hard.  Much easier then putting it in and taking it out of the guitar for Guitar Hero.<br /><br />For everyone else, go ahead and buy this with a game that can utilize the extra control and you will have fun.  It's well worth the $

When the Wii remote was designed it did not acommodate (cost/benefit?) more precise sensing devices; Now you will be able to play with great realism but depending on your enthusiasm you will have to press the "2" button, rest the wii remote (with the attached wii Motionplus) on a flat surface, and in less than one second the sensing devices will be recalibrated. Curb your enthusiasm!

Makes the Wii a better gaming system
This piece of equipment makes the Wii about 300% more responsive. The reviews based on price are just absurd. The reviews are SUPPOSED to be based on the product. As for the guy complaining about the responsiveness with Tennis? I can't speak to that, but Tiger Woods golf is a phenomenally better experience with the Motion plus.

Don't notice it, doesn't get in the way
I don't have much to say about this product, which is a good thing, since you actually don't want to notice this accessory, and you don't want it getting in the way.<br /><br />We've been using this with Wii Sports Resort, and based on the extreme fun level of Wii Sports Resort, I'd say this accessory is a success.<br /><br />My 11 year old son did comment right away that it made the Wiimote a bit bigger, but he never commented on it again. I didn't really notice any difference, and we quickly got deep into the game, not thinking about the controller (which is how it should be).<br /><br />One surprise was that Wii Sports Resort actually required the MotionPlus for each player (I incorrectly assumed it was optional), so be sure to purchase one of these for each player.  If you want to have 3 or 4 player games in Wii Sports Resort, for example, then you will need 3 or 4 of these. It's not an option to just have one player have an inferior experience. Similarly, you need 3 or 4 Nunchuks if you want 3 or 4 player games for some of the games.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it seems this would have to drain some Wiimote battery, and the Wiimotes already suck batteries way too quickly.  I suppose I just need to invest in some rechargeable batteries.<br /><br />Finally, note that there is a temporary special bundle of Wii Sports Resort that includes TWO of these MotionPlus accessories, so be sure to shop for the bundles first, before buying these individually.

Adding Wii MotionPlus
It's takes a little bit of time to get used to MotionPlus.  Just when you thought you had the knack of the games and knew exactly how to move, along comes MotionPlus.  It really detects your movements!  One small issue is that we have to unhook the MotionPlus and pull back the cover to continue to use our charging station.  Overall a great addition to the Wii.

Wi owner
Had no choice but to buy several of these motionplus sensors.  Bought the sport resort and in order to play the game you need this sensor.  Some of the resort games came with 1 or 2 sensors.  So to play with 4 players you needed more sensors.

Adds an extra element to your MotionPlus-enabled Games
I was one of the first adopters for the Wii when it first came out.  The WiiMotes (Wii Remote) were plain and had no silicone jackets on them.  I remember buying some generic silicone covers to protect them.  I was glad to see that Nintendo started to provide the WiiMotes like this and even sold the Wii MotionPlus with the silicone jacket.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you will want to look for games that have a MotionPlus symbol to get the rumble affect out of it.  I imagine that more games in the future will be Wii MotionPlus enabled.<br /><br /><br />Here is my most recent scenario of using the Wii MotionPlus add-on.  <br /><br />Game:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U2BMH2">EA SPORTS Grand Slam Tennis</a><br /><br />Accessory:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FC6TCE">Wii Thrustmaster Motion Plus Tennis Duo Pack NW</a><br /><br />The Grand Slam Tennis Wii game has another dimension when you add the MotionPlus "plug" to the bottom of the remote.  They can actually be removed from the silicone jacket easily and placed in the bottom of the remote when it goes into another accessory.  The MotionPlus adds the typical rumble effect and is supposed to be more sensitive to movement and position.  I think this is right on!  The Grand Slam Wii Tennis game is NOT EASY to begin with (not like the Wii Sports tennis).  This game takes some getting used to and some skill.  It is my hypothesis that the MotionPlus adds to this realism.  <br /><br />Lots of fun and definitely one of those items you want to consider having at least two of in your Wii accessory kit.  I will be seeking more games that use MotionPlus and will try them out.  It adds another dimension to the Wii that just makes the Wii that much more fun and accessible for those of us who find some of the other consoles more complicated (gaming challenged).<br /><br />5 Stars!<br /><br />

Review Based on Value
A lot of the reviews for Wii Play are pretty spot on when compared to a regular Wii game, but I don't think it's fair to compare it to a regular game.  When you buy Wii Play, you basically get a remote (worth $40) along with the game, so the dispositive question is whether Wii Play is a worthy $10 game.<br /><br />I would answer that with a resounding YES.  It clearly looks and feels like a technical demo for the Nintendo Wii, but again, it's a $10 game.  If you're into minigames of the type you'd play in Mario Party or Wario Ware, Wii Play is your cup of tea.  You get 9 mini games:<br /><br />Shooting Range - basically duck hunt.  Everybody loves duck hunt, right?  It works surprisingly well with the Wii remote.  Both single-player and multi-player are pretty fun.<br />Find Mii - basically Where's Waldo.  There's a clutter of Mii's (people) on screen and you have to find a pair that match, or a particular Mii, etc.  2-player mode basically awards points to the first person who finds the Mii.  Also fun in single-player and multi-player modes.<br />Ping Pong - control the paddle with the on-screen wii-mote pointer.  Not really that fun, you don't actually use any motions like in tennis, you just direct the paddle on-screen to where the ball is.  It's actually quite similar to the pong/air hockey game.<br />Pong/Air hockey - similar to Ping Pong in concept, you control your paddle on screen with the wii-mote and try to score the puck into your opponent's goal.  Not that great single player, but pretty fun multiplayer since it's a little more frantic than ping pong.<br />Bubbles - guide shapes into bubbles to pop them.  IMO, the worst game of the bunch.  It's basically a reflex game, where you take three shapes and try to fit them into slots by directing and rotating with the wii-mote.<br />Billiards - Pretty fun single player or multiplayer.  A standard pool game.<br />Fishing - Similar to the mechanical board game where you try to stick you fishing pole magnet into the fish's mouth.  Kinda fun for awhile.<br />Cow Racing - Pretty fun, shows off how the wii-mote can be used to drive and steer.<br />Tank - Steer a tank around and lay mines or shoot shells.  It probably has the least amount of wii-mote interactivity (you point on screen to aim your shots, that's about it, everything else is standard console controls).  Lots of people seem to like this one, I didn't so much.<br /><br />Anyways, bottom line is that it's $10.  And it's totally worth the $10.

The controller is great! The game... well... yeah.
I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VXBAQ">Nintendo Wii</a>. I wrote a review about it right after I got it. It's a wonderfully fun little machine! Now that I've got it online, I've downloaded all sorts of stuff, voted in polls and had a generally grand time! What I lacked was a second controller.<br /><br />Enter "Wii Play".<br /><br />Don't buy this game for the game. The game is crap. "Wii Sports" is better and more entertaining and you get that for free. But to make "Wii Sports" even more fun, you need a second player. For that, a second controller is vital. Since you need one anyhow, buy this bundle.<br /><br />"Wii Play" isn't completely bad. The cow racing, laser hockey, shooting and pool games are basically fun and provide some dandy two-player action. The others are forgettable.<br /><br />So in short: don't by this game for the game. Certainly don't buy the seprate version of the game. But since you need another controller, buy this bundle. Get the controller. Spend $[...] on a game you  might play for a couple hours.<br /><br />Enjoy!

If you need a remote, buy this instead
It's a $10 game...  the people complaining that it isn't like Wii Sports are expecting a little too much.  There's 8 games total, 4 of which are pretty fun and good party games.  That comes to like 2.50 for a decent game - people spend more than that on their daily coffee.  The Find a Wii game is maddenningly addictive, and a great 2+ player game.  Tanks is great as well - it would be nice to save and pick up at some of the harder levels rather than going through the first 4-5 levels to get to a good challenge, but of well.  And the Shooting game is another great 2 player game - it gets pretty frantic with two wiimotes firing away for the highest score.  The other games are probably better for a party, but decent either way.  If you have 4 wiimotes, don't buy this.  If you need or want another wiimote, grab this instead and you'll be pleasantly surprised with some of this microgames, just don't expect another wii sports, or full game, because that's not what they were after.

A great game for fun and exercise
I admit, I wasn't expecting much when I first heard about Just Dance a few months ago. I figured it'd be just like another one of those games like Dancing with the Stars and High School Musical where you see characters on screen dancing, but all you're doing is waving your remote to match the visual cues on the screen. Ho Hum. <br /><br />The first thing that struck me when I popped the game into the Wii was that these were fun songs from every era. They're all family-friendly, and there's something in the track list for everyone, from baby boomers to Gen X'ers to Gen Y'ers. Here's the entire track list. Most of the songs are not covers, but original tracks from the original singers. <br /><br />Girl Just Want to Have Fun - Cyndi Lauper<br />Ring My Bell - Anita Ward<br />A Little Less Conversation (JXL Radio Edit Remix) - Elvis vs. JXL<br />Cotton Eye Joe - Rednex<br />Surfin' Bird - The Trashmen<br />Heart of Glass - Blondie<br />Womanizer - The Gym All-Stars<br />Groove Is in the Heart - Deee-Lite<br />Jerk It Out - Caesars<br />I Live to Move It (Radio Mix) - Reel 2 Real feat. The Mad Stuntman<br />Not N Cold (Chick Version) - Katy Perry<br />Mashed Potato Time - Dee Dee Sharp<br />Girls and Boys - Blur<br />Fame - In the style of Irene Cara<br />Lump - The Presidents of the United States of America<br />Kids in America - Kim Wilde<br />Pump Up the Jam - Technotronic<br />I Get Around - The Beach Boys<br />Le Freak - Chic<br />That's the Way (I Like It) - KC and the Sunshine Band<br />Louie Louie - Iggy Pop<br />Funplex (CSS Remix) - The B-52s<br />Jin Go Lo Ba - Fatboy Slim<br />DARE - Gorillaz<br />Bebe - Divine Brown<br />Eye of the Tiger - Survivor<br />Can't Get You Out of My Head - Kylie Minogue<br />Acceptable in the 80s - Calvin Harris<br />Who Let the Dogs Out - Baha Men<br />Wanna Be - Spice Girls<br />Step By Step - New Kids on the Block<br />U Can't Touch This - MC Hammer<br /><br />The second thing that impressed me was that this game features actual dance moves to the songs. In other words, not only are you playing the game, you're learning actual dance steps. You'll learn the "Mashed Potato" that was all the rage in the 1960's to Dee Dee Sharp's "Mashed Potato Time". You'll learn the best disco moves of the 70's with songs like "That's the Way I Like It". And my personal dream come true--you can dance like MC Hammer with "U Can't Touch This". <br /><br />For the controller, they went for a decidedly simpler approach, and they hit a home run. For using one Wii remote, the controls are remarkably accurate as far as detecting whether you're dancing correctly or not. For each move, you'll be given a grade of "Great", "Okay" and "X". Now, I won't lie and say the controls are the most precise in the world. There'll be plenty of times you'll be doing the moves precisely, but the Wii will tell you you're not. But where this game triumphs is that even though the controls may be off, the game is so fun that you really don't care. <br /><br />And you also find that the more you practice the moves and "feel the music", the better your scores become. If you've gotten to the point where you've memorized the dance and are just doing the moves to the music, your score will be great.<br /><br />The game is simple. You choose a song, and then after a countdown from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, you'll see a silhouetted character on your screen doing the dance moves. The character is generally dressed appropriately for the song: a disco dude will lead you through "That's the Way I Like It", a cowgirl will do a two-step to "Cotton Eye Joe", and a dog (yes, a dog) will dance to "Who Let the Dogs Out". You basically just have to do the mirror image of the character's moves. <br /><br />They also have multiplayer games. In the first game (Challenge), you can basically have a dance-off between you and up to three other friends to see who'll get the high score. Again, you don't mind in this case if the controls are not completely precise because you're all on the same playing field. In the second game (Strike a Pose), it's like a game of Red Light / Green Light where you have to freeze in your tracks when the music stops. The third game (Last one standing) is an elimination game where the person who makes the least mistakes wins the game. <br /><br />As fpr the exercise value, with virtually every song, I ended it panting because I was out of breath, and even though I was out of breath I wanted to try it again and again until I got it right. To me, that's the sign of a great exercise game.

It's just fun, whether or not you're good at scoring points
While the game play mimics Guitar Hero or Dance Dance Revolution style games, one thing sets this game apart: if you're not good at matching the dance moves, the song (and the game) keep going. You don't get interrupted, or have the song get cut short because you miss a certain number of moves.<br /><br />What that means to players: you can play any of the songs, regardless of difficulty or effort rating, and make it through the entire song. You also get to choose abbreviated or full-length versions of the song.<br /><br />While other games claim to be great at giving you a cardiac workout, this will *really does*. Songs are rated on difficulty and effort. Difficulty relates to the complexity of the dance moves, while effort is how fast you'll be moving. There is a nice combination of songs with low difficulty/high effort, and vice-versa.<br /><br />Also you have up to 4 players at a time, and anyone can join the song mid-stream.

80s Babies/90s Child's delight! Pure FUN
I'll admit: this game may not be for everyone.  You can't be shy.  You have to let it all out and not care who's watching (or you won't score points!)  But for the goofball dancers out there who loved doing the "Whop", "Running man", "Monkey", "Disco Hustle" back in the day, you're gonna have a BLAST!  You have a choice between short or regular versions for real workout!  It may not score accurately- but really, if you're looking to score points; you're playing the wrong game. <br /><br />

A great workout without even knowing you're exercising!
I plugged this into the wii to check it out and about 10 minutes later I was out of breath...but I kept going because it was so fun.  Then I challenged the spouse and we both danced for at least another 30 mins.  I didn't realize how much time had gone by because we were having so much fun trying to beat each other!  I admit...it' totally cheese and the graphics are not very good...but who cares - it's a great workout without even thinking about exercising!  I love it!

Fun and Exhausting
I love this game.  It is so much fun.  My son and I have danced around the living room since we've had it.  I bought this game to secretly get my son to do some exercise.  It is very cold this winter and my son doesn't get out as much.  He doesn't realize it though because he is having so much fun.  I love it myself because it allows me to dance and do some cardio as well -- although after 5 songs it is so exhausting.  I don't care though because you don't want to stop dancing.  I highly recommend this game.

FUN! FUN! FUN!
This is the best exercise video I ever bought! I know! I know! It's a video game! But I still consider this as an exercise video. Actually, better than a regular dance aerobics video because this one actually tells you if you're doing the movements correctly. Whenever I'm doing it, I feel like I have my very own dance aerobics coach!!!

Very fun game!
My family and I love this game.  We already have the Dance Dance Revolution game, but with only one dance pad.  This game makes it possible for four of us to dance at the same time, which is an incredible amount of fun.  I feel like I'm getting a great workout, and it does not require any additional hardware to play, which is a great thing.  I would like to see more games like this with more songs, but until then, we'll just have to keep dancing to the same ones over and over.

I am a 63 year old woman and what fun this is...  I like it better than my Wii Fit.  I use my Wii Sport and then usually go to this for exercise.  It is just a fun thing to do.  I don't do to well but have loads of fun.  Try it!!

Lots of fun with friends or even alone
There are complaints the game does not respond correctly to your moves but WHO CARES? this game is a lot of fun.  I first did the songs I knew then went to songs I didnt know and some of those I ended up doing the best at or ended up liking the song anyway and were fun to dance to. <br />Game is fun and you get some exercise....some songs are more active than others.<br />I had not even heard of this game till my friends mentioned it after playing at someone else's house so I ordered it from Amazon cheaper than it was in the stores. I played it at their house and loved it so much I ordered a copy of my own right then and there (at an even LOWER price)<br />All you need is the regular wii mote. You do not need the nunchuck or dance pad or anything else.

Absolutely hysterical!!
The motions to Ring My Bell had me laughing so hard that I just had to stop and sit down.  I am not a dancer and can't figure out my right foot from my left.  Thankfully, I didn't have to worry about my feet; all I had to concentrate on were my arms and having a good time.  The game doesn't fail you, so again, you can leave worry behind and just have a good time.  My review is based upon only thirty minutes of play with my boys (10 and 11) on multiplayer challenge, but the fun we had in those thirty minutes was priceless. I can't wait to share this with my fun adult friends who have a lively sense of humor.

Dancing Non-Stop
The Game Just Dance was really fun for my mom and I. My mom really loves it and urges me to play every 5 minutes!! I got this game for my 11th birthday on January 9th and my mom and I played it ever since. The game is fun because you could dance and sing along with the popular songs it has. It's extremely fun and anyone who got it will be a pro dancer in no time.

best dance game!
Ok, so I am NOT a dancer at all. I never dance at all!!! I was forced to buy this game as a Christmas gift and I hated spending the money on it. We put it in when we had a few friends over and I laughed and video taped them dancing. Then I got drug into it and did one song and LOVED every minute of it. It's not about being a good dancer at all. It's just an all around fun game for the family. We plan on playing it for New Year's with a bunch of friends. Best dance game ever by far!!!

Forget board games and start dancing!
JUST DANCE ROCKS!  Instead of the standard ritual of sitting around the dinner table with your family playing board games, turn on the music and get your body moving.  Just Dance is awesome!  It has a wonderful selection of songs for every age and yes, while you must commit to letting your inhibitions go, once you do everyone is guaranteed to have a great time.  And the bonus is that you're burning calories at the same time!

This game has entertained both college kids and older adults in our house for hours!  It's a very good aerobic workout, and if you get 3 or 4 competing on scores it can be hilarious!  Good selection of songs and fun routines make the time go by fast.

A Fun Workout!
I got Just Dance because it looked like a fun way to get some cardio on the days I cannot make it to the gym plus would give me some variety.  I couldn't have chosen any better!  I am the worlds worst dancer and don't have a graceful bone in my body, but I absolutely love this game.  It makes me sweat more in 15 minutes than I do with 30 min of jogging intervals on the treadmill.  Unlike the elliptical, treadmill and stairclimbers, this works me out from head to toe.  I like it so much that I even do it the on the four or five days a week that I do go to the gym.

Great family arcade style game.
I have never owned a Mario Kart before so can't compare to the other versions but this one for the Wii is a fun game. I was worried before I bought that the Wii wheel would not work very well. I was way wrong, I think it works very well. <br /><br />The tracks and game play are a lot of fun for someone of any age. The game is easy to learn for beginners and is fun for the more experienced gammer. The game reminds me of something you would play at an arcade with all kinds of things going on as you drive through the course. Playing against friends is a lot of fun a well. <br /><br />I tried out the on line play and it was a blast. I just had fun compared to some of the xbox/ps3 on line racing games where it can be stressful trying to compete and listening to angry 13 year olds. <br /><br />If you are looking for a game that is fun for the family, especailly the kids, I would pick this one up. Its easy to learn and a lot of fun to play.

Racing To The Checkered Wii Flag
Undoubtingly, Nintendo has really showed more muscle within their games for the Wii this past year. With games that really stretched beyond the imagination for fans like Super Mario Galaxy, which re-defined Mario alone in adventures, and the battle smashing action of Super Smash Brothers Brawl that dominated fans hearts all around the worls, Nintendo really shows what it takes to make great video games. But, that also can be said with the Mario Kart series, which finally makes it debut on the Wii. But, following the innovation that Mario Kart DS had from the Nintendo DS wasn't so easy, largely because it was the first DS handheld title to use the Wi-Fi online gaming to an outrageous excitement for gamers all around the world. Now, it is time for the Wii to take that on and race to the checkered flag.<br /><br />Mario Kart Wii for the Nintendo Wii, brings in all that fast-paced excitement racers have wanted and even more. The game adds a whole lot of new and exciting features to use. You can now race as many as 12 racers online through the online gaming, and bring the action over the top, and use that skill and excitement on over 40 different tracks: 10 battle tracks and 32 exciting race tracks that are both new and featured from the earlier Mario Kart games like D.K. Jungle Highway and Sherbet Land from Mario Kart 64. The new tracks are also exciting that will have you racing and bouncing on top of mushrooms from the all-new Mushroom Gorge, and have you crusing the shopping malls and racing down fligts of escaltors with the brand new Coconut Mall course, or racing across the tree trunks of the new Maple Leaf Highway. Every single track is great for beginners and die hard Mario Kart fans of all ages.<br /><br />The gameplay also has a few new surprises, as you not just rave in karts, you also get to race on motorbikes too, bringing more action and variety to each of the players delight. There are also a few new power-ups here too including the Mega Mushroom, from the DS game New Super Mario Brothers, which makes your racer giant-sized, so you can squash your opponents on your way to the checkered flag, and the lightning cloud which shrinks you down to a tiny racer, so you squeeze underneath your opponents and take them by surprise. There also are a few new characters here to unlock in the game as well. You can choose to race with the classics like Mario, Yoshi, Bowser and Luigi, and 6 hidden characters to unlock and master like Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy, Funky Kong and Diddy Kong from Donkey Kong Barrel Blast and even Bowser Bones (the skeleton Bowser boss from New Super Mario Brothers.) <br /><br />The control is also a bit new here, with the use of the Wii Wheel. The wheel is easy to setup and hooks right onto the Wii remote. You can steer your racers easily through each and every race by turning your wheel left and right, and performing nifty stunts like a wheelie or a 360 on a jump. While the control with the Wii Wheel takes a lot to get used to for veterans, there are others ways to control the game. Like Super Smash Brothers Brawl, gamers can also use the Wii & nunchuck controls, or the classic controller and even the Nintendo Gamecube controller, so veterans can feel more comfortable in anyway they want to race. The graphics here are also well-designed, by bringing new excitement in restoring the classic courses, and a lot of great surprising new features that are the delight to anyone who loves the Mario Kart games. <br /><br />All in all, Mario Kart Wii is definitely one of the best games I've ever enjoyed for the Nintendo Wii. I absolutely loved the need for plumber speed, and it shows in each and every race. This is definitely a must buy for your Wii video game library, that is sure to be a thrilling race and not even close to wiping out anytime soon. So start your Wii-motes, because the race is not ever going to stop.<br /><br />Graphics: A<br /><br />Sound: A-<br /><br />Control: B for the Wii Wheel; B+ for the Wii & nunchuck controllers, A for the Classic and Gamecube Controllers<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: A- for solo gamers; A for multiplayer action<br /><br />Overall: A-

Good Franchise, Good Hype, Good Game, Minor Issues
Mario Kart is one of those franchises that instills great memories whether you first played on the SNES like a lot of us old school gamers did, or the N64, or even on the hand helds.  It is a franchise that demands more than cookie-cutter remakes that many game developers have been putting out as of late.  It is easy to create a lot of hype over a game and then have that hype kill the game when it doesn't meet the insane expectations.<br /><br />That said, Mario Kart Wii meets all expectations and even goes a little beyond.  <br /><br />One of the first things I was looking forward to was the unique interface that the Wii puts on just about everything.  The steering wheel was what I was looking forward to the most since I thought I would get complete control of the character.  I must admit, the wheel is VERY responsive... almost too responsive.  It is very easy to any beginner or even a veteran to overcompensate and steer into a wall, especially if they're not used to a free-floating steering wheel.  <br /><br />However, we did find that the wheels were critical if one wanted to use the Wii remotes accurately.  It is a real pain to steer without a wheel attachment.  We literally had to go out and purchase three more wheels because the remotes felt so awkward without one.  We later just threw down the remotes and ended up using the gamecube controllers (which you can use) since we're not only used to it but it seems to have much better control.<br /><br />The next thing I was looking forward to were the new menus, characters, vehicles etc.  I was really pleased with the motor bikes included in the game and their exclusive features.  I personally found the Flame Cycle with Waluigi to be my personal favorite.  It was great they brought back all the old characters and, more importantly, they took out all the unfair advantages some had over others.  Now, everyone is not scrounging to play as King Boo or the Plant thingy.  I thought it was awesome that I was able to unlock my own Mii to play.<br /><br />One of the things that really impressed me was the reinvention of retro courses from classic systems including the gamecube, the SNES, Gameboy Advance etc.  It was nice to see old courses that I was familiar with.  I kinda wish they would've brought back Baby Park from the Gamecube since that was one of our favorite places to do battle.  <br /><br />The items were kinda iffy.  We were really annoyed at the Bloopers, that shower your screen with dark ink so you can't see temporarily.  It was cute at first but then it got really annoying.  The "hot potato" lighting cloud is probably the most annoying; it would tag you and after a certain time, detonate.  You could pass it off to another opponent by bumping them but if you're in first, alone or otherwise far behind you are screwed.  This item, they could've done without.  <br /><br />The menus were the next iffy part.  It took me a while to figure out how to switch the 1st player mode from the Wii remote to the Gamecube controller.  You are also seemingly limited to how you team up with friends.  Granted the team battle and team races are one of the best changes Nintendo made, but I wish they would allow two-players to partake in the Grand Prix.  The menus just don't seem all that user-friendly.<br /><br />The internet feature is interesting.  I'm not accustomed to playing any Mario Kart online (save for the DS) but it was a very nice setup.  No more are we limited to annihilating our friends in the privacy of our own home; now we can do that but annihilate world-wide opponents in the privacy of our own home.  Not a real fan of online play but loved it anyway, way more than Smash Bros. Brawl.<br /><br />Lastly is the graphics; the Wii doesn't go beyond 480 resolution so one shouldn't really expect anything grand.  The Wii is made for innovative gameplay, not graphics.  If you want graphics, get an XBox360 or a PS3.  <br /><br />Overall, despite some small issues, the game is superb all around.  A 96% to be certain.  Buy it if you find one!

AMAZING
So at first I was a little skeptical about this game because I have played every other version of Mario Kart and the Wii Wheel worried me because it seemed like it would be hard to control and gimmicky. After having played it, I actually find it to be the most fun out of all the mario karts. This version is very similar to Mario Kart 64 only with additional features such as<br /><br />*12 racers in the grand prix<br />*Online racing (This morning I raced 12 people from around the world and there was no lag and hardly any wait time)<br />*Tricks (that can be done with the flick of the wii wheel, although I noticed occasionally the tricks are unresponsive if you don't shake it hard enough)<br />*16 new courses and 16 retro courses.<br />*You can play as your mii<br /><br />I love the courses, they are very colorful with great music and range from piece of cake to challenging<br />There's a ton of items you can use to "attack" opponents with such as that horrible blue shell that attacks the racer in first place. It's also great from any age range. In my opinion someone as young as 5 and as old as 50 could enjoy this game. All in all its a great game!!!<br /><br />9.5/10

A n awesome  update to a great long running series
Any fan growing up with a Super Nintendo or Nintendo 64 system should be more than familiar with the Mario Kart series. A fun go kart series of games using popular Mario universe based characters and puts them into the drivers seats of various karts. Each driver having pros and cons due to his size and weight and other differing characteristics.<br /><br />This popular series has been on almost every system made by Nintendo, and it was only a matter of time before it would find its way to the Wii as well. Would it live up to the standards that the series has come to be known for over the years? That's a matter of opinion but I would have to say 100 times yes.<br /><br />The biggest addition to the series of course is the fact that it being on the Wii it is going to use the Wii Remote as a main controller to drive. And it was a perfect way for Nintendo to get in a new gimic type of holder to put the remote into. That being the Wii Wheel. A plastic mold shaped like a steering wheel that your remote snaps into easily. Sure its just a piece of plastic holding the remote in place but I must admit it is fun to play the game using a steering wheel. Adds a new something to it that just pushing a button on a controller doesn't provide. But rest assured , if you don't like the gimicy device, you can play the game with the remote and nunchuck or even the game cube and classic controllers. So that really is another plus to the game how you aren't limited in how you want to control the karts. And no matter which method you use, the game controls are smooth and easy to get used to.<br /><br />Like all Mario Kart games you are given a choice of various Mario themed characters to choose and then its off to the races. You can unlock even more characters as you progress through the game and choose not just one vehicle but various vehicles. This go around there are karts of all sizes and shapes, motor bikes and super karts too. So you will be able to have so many different experiences playing this game through the differnet characters and vehicles you can use.<br /><br />Kept true to the series they still have the various items you pick up while driving and using as ways of catching up to those in front of keeping those behind you where they belong, eating your dust. <br /><br />The biggest and maybe most appealing addition to this version of the game is the online play features that are now available. You can play on line against anyone in the whole world who happens to be online at the time. Or against your own friends who own the game. So that too will add a long replayability to the game. You can either play people from across the world or your own friends across the country at any time. There are battle modes and team based modes and even classic stages from previous versions of Mario Kart now updated and ready to play on in a Wii graphically updated way. <br /><br />This game is really all that and more. Ever since I got it I haven't been able to put it down. And I think you won't be putting it down any time soon either. Once you get hold of that wheel there is no telling where you will be driving to as you try and beat the competition to be top kart driver. If you have a Wii and are a fan of the Mario Kart series this is must have. And if you never played a Mario Kart before, no better version to start with. This is well worth it, especially with the online capabilities. The fun factor is high and those who can't get this are truly missing out. <br /><br />Thanks Nintendo. You have done it again.

Just plain awesome
Mario Kart has just about always been a safe bet in terms of video game fun, and the eagerly anticipated Mario Kart Wii is certainly no exception.  Mario Kart Wii features a large selection of tracks, of which are brand new and remastered tracks from previous games in the series to boot; all of which are well designed and fun to race, albeit the classic tracks aren't nearly as stylisticly designed as the new ones.  The addition of motorcycles surprisingly works well, and despite a change in some of the game's old mechanics (drifting has never been easier to perform), the game works and races very well.  Most notably is the use of the included Wii Wheel, which surprisingly responds quite well and feels very good as well.  Though it may take some getting used to at first, Mario Kart Wii also supports just about every controler available for the Wii, which in itself is a big plus.  The game as a whole is easy to get into, the online play is well done, the items (while more unbalanced than ever) are imaginitive, and of course, the multiplayer is spectacular fun.  All in all, you really can't go wrong with Mario Kart Wii, which is yet another spectacular triple-A title to come from Nintendo, and another essential pick up for your Wii.

Even Better Than Expected!
WOW - I Am Hooked!  Let me just say that I've anticipated the release of this game since standing in line to get the Wii the first day it was released and I can truly say that it's even better than I expected!  For what it's worth, I'm in my late 20's and was a HUGE fan of Kart for the 64 back in the day (I feel it's worth mentioning that since the only negative reviewer thus far said he did not care for the 64 version).  It can be a bit frustrating at times, but that's part of the reason why it's so great!  You can be in last place and come back to win it all (or get in the top 5 anyway).  The wheel works great - feels very comfortable.  You press the built-in trigger (or B button) to drift and build speed or if you race in automatic, then it doubles as a special button, but mostly that's the left button on the control pad.  2 is accelerate and 1 is brake/reverse, although I'm not sure the brake works quite as well as it did in the 64 version.  Online play is AWESOME, but there are some pretty darn good racers out there (even though it just came out today!)  It's difficult to write a elegant review since it's way past my bedtime, but I wanted to tell potential buyers how awesome this game is before I go to bed!  I'm not a big fan of Smash Bros - I thought Mario Galaxy was very very good, but in my opinion, Mario Kart is the very best game out there for Wii!  If you're going to play with friends at your place, I recommend spending $10 for extra wheels - it makes it much more fun!  Race On!

Great Family Game
I picked up this game on the 26th (yesterday) from my local game store and right away the entire family started playing. The game is very simple and not much different from the other Mario Karts of past except of course for the onlilne play which we haven't tried out as yet. There are a few characters to choose from, adult and baby alike and steering is pretty easy. You race against your chose characters and your Mii's are also included in the races. You just might see your Mii pass you by. We did it without the wheel (since we only had 1) and was surprised at how easy it was. The graphics are also pretty good. You go forward by using the 1 and 2 button to go forward or reverse and B to use your special. All in all a very good game and it was well worth the wait.

A Fantastic Ride For The Wii...
Dating back to the SNES days, Mario Kart is one of Nintendo's longest running franchises, and every new generation of Nintendo's consoles brings with it a new Mario Kart.  Coming after the absolute masterpiece that was Mario Kart Double Dash for the Gamecube and a solid portable showing for the Nintendo DS, the Wii incarnation of Mario Kart has some pretty big shoes to fill.  In most ways, it fills them very well.<br /><br />Mario Kart Wii is built around the use of the Wii Wheel, which is a small plastic shell that fits around the Wii Remote and acts as a steering wheel, allowing the player to control the action by tilting the controller back and forth, much like in the earlier Wii racing title Excite Truck.  I have to admit that I was skeptical about the wheel at first - it just seemed very gimmicky.  Much to my surprise, however, it offers such a tight control scheme that I've yet to put much time into any of the other control options that the game offers. (If you don't want to use the wheel you have numerous other configurations to choose from, including the classic Gamecube controller.)  The sensitivity on the wheel is extremely high, however, with a 15 degree twist of the wheel being all it takes to turn your kart as far as it can turn without going into a slide.  At first it's VERY easy to over-steer, but after a few races it becomes second nature.  Far from being the gimmicky nightmare I'd feared, the wheel actually adds to the game experience and makes it all the more fun.<br /><br />There are several new additions to the game, such as drafting (following closely behind another player to get a speed boost due to decreased wind resistance), pulling aerial tricks during jumps to net speed boosts, and, most obviously, the addition of motorcycles.  The motorcycles integrate nicely into the game, and their superior maneuvering, acceleration, and the ability to get a brief speed boost at will by popping a wheelie are balanced well by reducing their ability to make use of "mini-turbo" boosts from drifting around turns and the ease with which they are physically muscled around by the actual karts.  None of the new additions are earth-shattering in their scope, but all of the add just a little bit to the game without changing any of the essentials.  In short, they're just enough to keep things fresh without making a marked departure from the previous installments.  Also, in an attempt to make the game more accessible, drifting around corners is now accomplished with less effort than before - by merely holding down the B button and turning rather than holding the button and repeatedly jerking the nose of your kart into and out of your turn like in previous incarnations.  If even that is too much effort, you can also set the game to simply put your kart into a drift automatically every time you make a sharp turn, but by doing so you lose the brief turbo boost you're otherwise afforded by navigating a drift manually.<br /><br />Notably missing from the game, however, is the Double Dash gimmick of having another character riding shotgun with the driver to throw items.  The cooperative 2-player options that this configuration offered will be missed by some players, myself included, but it's certainly not a deal-breaker.  Also absent are the individual super-items from Double Dash, but this seems to be "balanced out" by the addition of a few powerful new items such as the Super Mushroom (which turns you into a giant and allows you to roll over other karts, squashing them flat), and the Bullet Bill (which changes your kart into a bullet and cause you to surge ahead past the other racers).  The individualized karts are gone from the last game as well, though there's no paucity of vehicles to choose from.  You begin the game with 3 karts and 3 bikes in each of the three weight classes and will unlock others as you progress.  The character you choose will also modify the abilities of the vehicle they're driving, so it isn't as if everyone on the road is a carbon copy.<br /><br />While Double Dash supported 8 vehicles per race, Mario Kart Wii ups the number to an impressive 12.  This means, among other things, that there are more items flying around than before and that the "pack" is much tighter throughout the race.  This can create a few frustrating moments when the player is bombarded with several items in a row and quickly loses position in the race, but it's honestly not as distracting as some reviewers have complained.  One thing of note is that the character models seem somewhat smaller than before relative to their surroundings, so sometimes it feels as if you're a minuscule character driving through an enormous world.<br /><br />Graphically the character models are only marginally better than they were in the Gamecube incarnation, but the actual tracks (There are 32 in all, 16 new and 16 returning from previous games.) have superior lighting and shading effects and the graphics have a pleasing, cartoony look to them. The game doesn't look as gorgeous as, say, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, but it certainly doesn't look bad either.  The game zips along with no apparent slowdown and looks quite nice even on a large TV.<br /><br />Much has been made about the WiFi connectivity of Mario Kart Wii, and I have to say that it surpasses expectations.  You don't spend much time waiting around in lobbies looking for players, and the game itself has very little (if any) lag while playing online.  A lot of folks are complaining that there's no voice chat, but this is (in part) a kid's game - 9 year-olds across the country don't need to hear me cussing like a sailor whenever I fall off the track.  You can play with random people from around the world (A spinning globe shows you where each of your opponents is from before your first race together) or with your buddies by way of swapping "friend codes".  I don't normally care much about playing games online, but Mario Kart Wii makes the experience very accessible and fun.<br /><br />Overall, Mario Kart Wii is an extremely fun racing game for the Wii that makes excellent and intuitive use of the Wii's motion sensing capabilities and provides the absolute best online gameplay yet on the console.  The game is all-age appropriate, even when playing online and is accessible enough that it can be played competently after just a few races.  This is easily the Wii's best racing game thus far and is surely destined to become one of the console's must-own titles.

Great game of course
I really enjoy the game however I strongly recommend not bothering getting the wheels for the game.  Both my wife and I felt that sometimes when we were using the wheel it didn't register all our turn inputs properly.  We prefer using just the nun chuck and the Wii mote.  So just a heads up if you were planning on getting the wheels for the game.

Wii are Having Fun Racing!
After playing this game on my friend's Wii, I went out and bought a Wii and this game.  That's how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I have the original Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo.  The basic game play is pretty much the same.  You are controlling one of the characters from the Mario universe as you attempt to race around tracks and win.  Along the way, you can pick up power ups to help you or hinder your opponents.  Of course, that means they can attack you as well, so watch out.<br /><br />With this incarnation, you've got 32 courses to play.  You start out with half of them available and earn the other half as you win races.  They include fun new courses created for this version as well as the best of the courses from the older incarnations of this game.<br /><br />This game can be played by one person or up to four people, each needing their own controllers.  Naturally, with four players, the screen becomes smaller, so you'd want to have a larger TV.<br /><br />You can also play this game over the internet.  I've raced against friends across town who also have it.  Or, if none of them are on line, you can race against strangers.  The game will set up matches from your region or around the world.<br /><br />But what really makes this game amazing in the remote.  Each copy comes with one steering wheel.  That's right.  Just put your regular remote in the wheel and suddenly you can steer your car.  I still haven't figured out quite how they set the receiver to do that.  You don't need to use the wheel, however.  You can just use your remote, although it isn't nearly as much fun.  Heck, you can even use your nunchuck controller if you'd like.<br /><br />The graphics are quite uneven on this game.  The newer levels look pretty good, but the older ones are done in the same, cheesy style.  Admittedly the entire thing is rather cartoonish.  But it really don't dampen my enjoyment in the slightest.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun game that I know I will be playing for a long time to come.

Favorite Video Game Of All Time
Mario Cart Wii is the next version of one of Nintendo's most successful and iconic video games, but this version takes the game to a whole new level. In addition to improved graphics, more tracks, and more character options (including your Mii), this game also allows online play. Friends can meet up and set up a "private room" where they race each other, or you can race with players around the world. I have enjoyed this feature the most. Every Tuesday night I meet up with 12 friends to race each other and it's a blast to knock your best friend off their cart so you can win the race. Very Fun!<br /><br />I can't recommend this game enough for any Nintendo Wii owner. Sure the basic concept of Mario Cart is still the same, but the enhancements for the Wii version make it worth the price. Although the Wii Wheel is not required to play the game I think it's worth the extra few dollars for the fun of it.

Fun for all!
Wow!  This is so much fun!  I don't usually get involved in driving games, but this one totally captivated me.  I play with my husband and 9 year old.  I place between 7th and 12th everytime, but it's great family fun.  Love it!

Even little ones can enjoy this game!
My four year old recently received this game for her birthday.  She had played it at a neighbor's house a few weeks ago and was rather happy that at long last she was able to play a Wii game.  I was skeptical that she'd be able to complete a course in the game, but she has proved me wrong over the past two weeks that she has had this game.  It is the only Wii game that she has been able to play without getting frustrated.<br /><br />The rest of the family is delighted with this game, as well.  I'm one of those people who lacks the capacity to successfully play video games well.  I'm pretty happy to report that I can play this game with absolute ease.  My older daughter (almost 8) loves this game.  She finds the menu of the game easy to operate and she easily navigates the race courses in this game.  My husband also had a pretty good time playing this game.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game for anyone, especially families with young kids.  I wish I had purchased this game a long time ago.  If I had known how much fun were were missing out on, I would have picked this up ages ago.

A MUST HAVE VIDEO GAME
I've had this video game since Christmas. Of all my Wii games this is the game my sister and I play the most. They have lots of characters to choose from and you can unlock more characters when you excel at the game.  This game can keep you entertained for hours.  You can play by yourself or with four players. Whatever you choose it's always fun.  Some of the tracks are easy and some are hard. I think this game is for all ages.  If you have a Wii this is a must have game!

Yes, it is the best Wii Game!
FUN, FUN, FUN!! We've had this game for 5 months. My husband and I, who don't even like video games, play this with our kids at least a few times a week. (And we've both been busted sneaking off and working on our personal "driver's licences." We got the Wii and this game for the kids, and we love it as much as them... the best is doing it all together. We have 15 Wii games and this one gets played WAY more than the others combined. If you only have this one game, the Wii console is totally worth it.

Mario kart Wii
Bought this for my son's 10th birthday and now the only game he has played on Wii for the last month. Good idea to order with a second wheel (which he is getting for Christmas) so they can race with a friend.

Absolutely Perfect Game
The whole family can play this game, there are so many races & battles to last for days. I have two special needs kids and they cannot get enough of this game especially my 7 yr old son who is addicted to it & we use that for incentive for good behavior at school and it works!!!!! Great job Nintendo.

Complete Mario Kart Wiiview
My grading scale with Wii Games looks like this ...<br /><br />5 star = A must play. No improvements need to be made. Has replay value (this is very important). I do not give out 5 star reviews open-heartedly. I consider any game worth playing, and owning is a 4 star game (which is may way of saying its 5 stars). But if a game receives 5 stars from me, I am in love. <br /><br />4 star = Even if its my favorite game for the Wii, I will hand out 4 stars to it cause I can view some improvements to be made. OR it does not have replay value. Either way, it was a game I would prefer over its competition / genre. I like to give any great game 4 stars just so I can leave some room for a potential 5 star game. <br /><br />3 star = Playable and fun game, I would recommend it but there may be a better alternative (a game that received a 4 star in the same genre)<br /><br />2 star = Not worth playing. No need to purchase. Much better games out there in the same genre.<br /><br />1 star = Silly game. A waste of time. No need to bother.<br /><br />I will go in depth with "Mario Kart Wii" as I have finished the game, and I was an avid player of the 64 version. If you were too then you would understand this review, if not, it may be hard to follow along.<br /><br />Mario Kart Wii Review = 5 stars (first 5 star Wii game I have given. More reviews to come)<br /><br />I give this game 5 stars as it is the best game for its genre. It is unique, full of strategy, and replayability. And when compared to the 64 version, great improvements have been made to Mario Kart Wii such that there is no reason why to not give it 5 stars this time around. Lets go in detail about the game ...<br /><br />Some upgrades from Mario kart 64 ... <br /><br />+ there are more characters per race. This time there is 12 instead of 8. I like having these larger races. It makes it much funner as computer opponents will use more items making it more challenging, but not too challenging for you. Numerous times computer opponents have helped me out in a win due to their items. the point system is as folows ... 1st = 15 ... 2nd = 12 ... 3rd = 10 ... 4th = 8 ... 5th = 7 ... 6th = 6 ... 7th = 5 ... 8th = 4 ... 9th = 3 ... 10th = 2 ... 11th = 1 ... 12th = 0. Good point system.<br /><br />+ new items added! All of your originals are there. Some new ones are as follows: <br /><br />"Bob-omb" (this is a bomb that you throw forwards and it explodes after a few seconds or until somebody runs into it wiping out anybody in the blast). My comments of this new item - second worst item to have in my opinion. They arent good for holding behind you to block a red or green shell cause once something hits it, it blows you up. So throwing it forward is all its good for. And the problem with this is its not entirely accurate. You dont know how far it will be thrown, and once it lands theres a few second wait before it detonates, as you catch up to where it lands it would have already detonated so you are not caught in the blast. The blast itself isnt entirely big. This would be a much better item if it had a larger blast and detonated as soon as it landed. The positive side to this is it can wipe out more than 1 driver (3 red shells though are much prefered). So its not an item that can help get you that first place. You will pick up this item in mid-pack<br /><br />"Bullet bill" ... remember those bullets shot out of cannons in the Mario games? Well this time you can turn yourself INTO one of them. Bullet Bill is immune to everything and gives you a large speed boost. Kind of like a star but MUCH better! My comments on this item: Bullet Bill is THE best item to have. You will only receive this item when you're in the back of the pack. I've received it in 8th. What he does is put you on course (you dont need to push any buttons, or drive him), he plows through anything, wiping drivers out, and he is VERY fast. Faster than a star or mushroom boost. This is the item that 12th place drivers look for and is a nice improvement from the 64 version as the lightning bolt used to be top choice. Bullet Bill has brought me from 12th into 1st (I should say, 12th into 3rd but I pulled into 1st a few seconds afterwards) on the last lap of the race. So with Bullet Bill now included in this game, ANYBODY has a chance of winning no matter where you are in the pack.<br /><br />"Blooper" ... the worst item to receive in my opinion. He is a squid that sprays ink on everybodys windshield so they get a bunch of black streaks. When somebody uses a blooper on you, it rarely ever affects the way you drive. You still have some of the screen to see through. Its really only effective if there was a banana along your path. And when you receive a blooper, its hard to tell if it helped you any. You will receive this item mid pack. However, it is a mass effect item effecting all drivers but yourself.<br /><br />"Mega Mushroom" ... this item turns you into a giant player. It makes you go faster, you plow through anything, and you squish people (they are still able to drive, but at a slower pace). This is not as effective as a Bullet Bill as you still have to drive the cart and you are not as fast. So bumping into a wall slows you down. A mega mushroom is about as effective as a star as you still retain defense from bananas and shells. You will receive this item mid pack.<br /><br />"POW block" ... these things are annoying! You'll have computer opponents playing these on you all the while. A POW block, once used by an opponent will show up on your screen above your cart and there is about 3 seconds until you wipe out. When you wipe out, you lose any items you had! In fact, these items will spill out on the track. Bananas, shells, and even any mushrooms! Which is pretty neat as if you run into that mushroom laying on the course, it gives you that speed boost. POW blocks are always annoying though when somebody uses one on you. It can send you off track, slow you down (computer opponents tend to have a better acceleration, and you lose your items). You will receive this item mid pack. There is a defense against a POW block however, and that is being in the air. POW block affects anything on the groud. Being in the air is a rare occurence though, you'd have to be at the right place at the right time.<br /><br />"Lightning Cloud" ... the third worst item to be had. You could also consider it the worst as this is the one item that HURTS you. What this item does is, a cloud hovers above you as soon as you receive it as an item and strikes a lightning bolt down to you giving you a temporary speed boost. After about 10 seconds, it will strike lightning on you and make you small. However, once you have this cloud above you, if you bump into another player, you pass it on to them! =). So it gives you a small speed boost to help you catch up with other players in an attempt to pass the side effect onto them. But if you are unable to pass it, being small isnt fun =(. <br /><br />+ I like the addition of a 3-second response if a red or blue shell is coming, or if a guy with a star, or bullet bill is behind you. Nice improvement there! You are given a warning as to what to expect.<br /><br />+ more gravity and stability. For example, in the 64 version of Mario kart, on Rainbow Road in the beginning you would go flying in mid air to land on the track. That doesnt happen here thank god. Your wheels stay on the ground! Additionally, in Bowsers Castle of the 64 version when you are driving down the steps, they would sometimes throw you off side to side. Here on the Wii version, your tires stay close to the ground, you dont bobble like in the 64 version. You stay centered and its a much more smoother drive.<br /><br />+ Another great improvement they made in this game form the 64 version is when you are small (by a Lightning bolt), you dont get flattened! In the 64 version, a banana, a driver, even a flying bat would flatten you and you would fall down as a feather usually ending up wayyy behind. Once you're small, you just drive slower and if a bigger player runs into you, you spin out.<br /><br />+ the blue shell (the one that goes after the player in first place) now has wings. The blue shell doesnt ride along the course anymore abling to knock out opponents in its path, but rathere flies over head and gets ONLY the first place driver. I like this addition because in the 64 version, if you had a banana, or a shell hanging on the back you couldnt block a blue shell, you lose your item and you spin out. Pain in the neck. Now you dont have to worry about a blue shell unless you are in first. Additionally, when the blue shell hits the guy in first place, it creates an explosion, so it can affect the second place driver as well. Surprisingly I found a defense against a blue shell. And that was a mushroom. When the blue shell (with wings) catches up to you and is floating above you for a second or two, use the mushroom and it will miss you. However, its not easy having a mushroom in 1st. You dont get any from an item box when in 1st, and if you were in second at the time, Im sure they would have been used to bring you up to that 1st position where the blue shell is headed. I only used that defense once in the entire 14 hours I played lol. Otherwise, when you hear a blue shell comin, you're SOL lol. But a strategy you can do is to brake before you get an item box cause if you get an item spinning, you will lose it. So break before the line of item box's, get hit by the blue shell then itemize a stronger weapon being in mid pack.<br /><br />+ the Wii version has upgraded to better graphics, its more 3D and colorful. Some levels are also more trickier as opposed to the basic levels in the 64 version. Its right up there with gameplay and technological improvements. There is nothing I miss from the 64 version that this game doesnt offer. Some levels are very pretty and add an element of adventure to the game. What makes a game adventurous to me, is a variety of scenic views. In this game, theres snow, lava, mountains, a rainbow in outer space, a board that looks like autumn (leaves falling and piled on the ground, very pretty). So this game is Strategy, Adventure, Racing, and Action (you're not just cruisin the world in a BMW you're fighting with other opponents at the same time with cool characters). The game is just as good playing singly as you can unlock boards, characters, and karts as well as play time trials and try to get a record on each course. And thats just half the fun when it comes to Multi Players. You can play against anybody in the world having an internet connection.<br /><br />+ customizeable karts and bikes. You dont have to just ride a kart, you can choose a bike. As you play the game in single mode, you unlock more of these. They are customizeable in such a way that each kart/bike is unique. Some offer better handling, speed, acceleration, drift. I really like this addition to the game. The original cart I was using I noticed I wasnt able to turn corners very well. So I prefer bikes with good drift (easier to turn corners).<br /><br />+ the Wii Wheel works! Dont explain to me how the wireless capability works or how it is very accurate but I dont have a problem at all with the wii wheel. Additionally, this wheel (by Nintendo) has a plastic opening where the Wii Remote send sits signal. i have heard that in the "sports package" that Wii Wheel does NOT have this.<br /><br />+ Tricks! Your bike can do a wheelie by tilting the Wii wheel back. By doing a weelie you are able to get a minor speed boost. It has helped me finish the race in a higher position and I use these all the time on straight ways to gain ground. Be careful though as you dont have much control over your bike. As in, you cant turn a corner. Another trick is when you are in the air, move the Wheel around and your guy will do a stunt in the air. Not only does it look cool, but once he lands ... you get a nice speed boost =). So these tricks add additional strategy to the game. Nice improvement here.<br /><br />+ you're able to drop red shells behind you! This wasnt allowed in the 64 version. In the 64 version, if you're in first and have a red shell it can only be shot forward (useless). Now you can drop it behind you. Also, in the 64 version you werent able to throw forward a fake item box, now you're able to =). I remember complaining years ago when playing the 64 version about this. Now you have any option, forward or backward.<br /><br />- I am not happy they continue to do this ... when you finish a race, everybody in that order finishes in that order once you cross the line. So if you come in first, and are needing Baby Peach for example to come in at leats third, if she was right behind you, you miraculously drop a green shell in front of the finish line, and she spins out ... she SHOULD have got 3rd, or 4th, but she will be awarded with 2nd =/. Maybe the game designers were unable to continue the AI (artifical intelligence) of them completing the actual race. This drawback, is not a big deal. I dont know if its ever hurt me. But it can go the other way as suppose Princess Peach was in third, the second place guy spins out, he keeps second place.<br /><br />- I dont like not knowing how to unlock. A lot of game are like this though. Ive completed the game, having a gold trophy in all levels and there are still 2 missing characters. I am not happy about this! I've only played Single "Grand Prix". Would I need to play multiplayer? Time Trial? Versus? That I dont know. I would have to go online for answers. <br /><br />- when you wipe out, you lose your items. This includes falling off the track. I dont necessarily like this. For example, if you were saving a star or some very useful item you have to beware of a POW block or getting hit by a shell as you will then lose that saved item. I like to save items, like 3 red shells when I'm in first. They provide strong defense and offense. Much better than the usual green shell or bananas you get while in first place lol. Its no biggie, just use the items once you receive them which is the usual case so you can pick up another item box.<br /><br /><br />Some additional notes ...<br /><br />... once you beat it in single mode (14 hours) it gives you little reason to play it again. I knwo Im whooped, but I finished it in 5 days. I'm sure I'd still play it again. Its one of those games when you're bored, "I feel like playing Mario kart". There are Time Trials you can experiment with. But what I dont like is exactly the same the first reviewer mentioned. You have to play for 14 hours to unlock things by yourself then when you play multi-player you're the usual first place finisher. The same was true with GoldenEye back on the 64. I used to play that with friends, friends who never played it would have very little chance of beating me or my cousin. But its not a problem cause if you play it long enough with your friends, they'll get the hang of it. Especially with this game as even a noob can beat a pro. Just takes the right items at the right time. So the fun will still remain with all.<br /><br />... characters still have multiple items like they did in 64 even without getting an item box. For example, Donkey and Diddy Kong will have extra bananas. Waluigi in this game for example was in second place. I was right behind him in third. He gets an item box and immediately shows a banana. I dodge when he drops it and expected him to be out of items. Nope ... he then immediately shows a FAKE item box and drops it. Im like where did that come from! And wouldnt you know 2 seconds later he throws a bob-omb at the first place driver! LOL. So yeah they receive free items, and they tend to be a little more faster than you at times for some reasons. (Maybe its the bike I am driving). But for the record, Waluigi wasnt a competitor throughout this cup. As in, he wasnt the guy that usually gets top 3. So having those extra items isnt the computers way of making sure these characters stay at the top of the pack.<br /><br />... Computer opponent AI seems to be more smarter. They'll purposely bump into you to push you off the track. Not always though. Happens most in the beginning as everybody is bumping around into each other. But this one race, Donkey Kong, right out of the gate rammed into me 3 or 4 times right after another to push me off the track (happened a few times). They will also try to snag a box they think you're going for. I only noticed this once though. I was on the inside part of the course in third place. 1st place grabbed a box on the inside so I swung to the outside to get one of those boxes, Koopa Troopa swung very quickly to the outside as to prevent me from getting one of those item boxes. And you know what he drove off the track and into water! lol He didnt run into anything, he mirror'd my action of moving outward and I know he did that purposely. I mean how often would the computer AI just freely throw himself off the course like that? lol What bites me though is I got into second and even though he fell off the course, he immediately passed me within 3 seconds! So that was unfair and unrealistic. He was one of the competitor opponents I was racing against to achieve more points than him. So maybe thats how the computer gioves the advantage to some characters.<br /><br />... 50CC = too easy. I usually finish 5 - 15 seconds ahead of the second place finisher. These races are probably for the kids.<br /><br />... 100CC = easy / medium. When first playing MarioKart Wii, 100 CC gave me a hard time. I wasnt able to finish 1st in the cup. Eventually they turned into medium as some cases I would tie at the end of the cup, and then they became easy. I am always winning at 100cc now.<br /><br />... 150CC = medium / hard. This is where the competition is. Its a very good race lets put it that way. You wont always finish in first for that cup. Its the kind of competition you WANT. And I will only play at this level. I consider it somewhat medium because now that I received gold in every cup at every level, 1st place isnt out of reach for me, not even on rainbow road which I consider to be the hardest board (Rainbow Road is on Special Cup). In fact on rainbow Road I was never able to finish higher than 11th. It was the very last race I played to complete the game and was 2 points behind somebody. What I did here on Rainbow Road was use my BRAKE and let up off of the accelerator. So thats the trick to beating this level. You just have to take it carefully and not fall off the track. I finished first and sealed the gold. Thats when the fist pump comes ;). Getting 1st on Rainbow Road was quite the challenge!<br /><br /><br />... It took 10 - 10.5 hours playing time to receive Gold in every cup. Once doing so, you will unlock a "Mirror Level" which is a 150CC level of every cup. And each race is the opposite. Meaning instead of turning right, you turn left. Its not hard. Some boards you were familiar with, you'll make a wrong turn. Once Mirror Level is unlocked, it took a few more hours to receive Gold in those cups. So total game time for me took about 14 hours. I used (2) new Duracell Rechargeable 2000 milliamp batteries once starting the game and they're still going. I'm testing Rechargeable batteries compared to the rechargeable Nintendo Wii battery. One reviewer mentioned AA rechargeables lasted longer. I would also suggest the AA batteries as you can use them in other electronics if needed. But the reason this game receives 5 stars ... its still playable! Its a multi-player game. In fact, I am wanting to have Wii Parties at my place playing Mario Kart! In addition to beer pong lol. So Mario Kart receives that 5 star status as it is the epicenter of your collection. Who isnt up for a game of driving and chuckin shells at each other? Other popular games like Zelda or Mario Galaxy, Once you beat these 2 games, they're done with (Im not positive on this as I havent played Super Mario Galaxy yet). They become a movie you've already seen. Mario Kart will continue to be played and should continue to be the #1 racing game. And thats where 5 star Fun comes in ... its a game that can make you frustrated, its a game that will make you pump your fist, shout out loud, curse at your friends, and make jokes. 5 stars all the way.

Just what I've been waiting for.
About a couple years ago I heard Nintendo was planning to dish out a black Wii.  I told myself I'd wait and hold off the white one, but what with all the great games already out, I couldn't resist.<br />As with most Wii purchasers, I added another Wii remote (or "Wiimote") and Nunchuk.  The white's fine and all, but I really wanted the colored controllers as in the initial advertisements for Nintendo's Wii.<br />Remember the lime green and red ones?<br /><br />Nevertheless, with two white controllers, I really didn't need any more.  That is, until the black one finally came out.<br />I was initially baffled upon spotting the device because I hadn't heard anything about its release, and just happened to stumble upon some at my local Target.  I asked the nearby clerk, "When did these come out?" but he didn't know (apparently they came out a week prior to this review).  I rushed home and placed an order for the Wiimote and Nunchuk through Amazon.com (price-sensitive, I wanted the best deal; I could wait for Amazon.com to deliver).<br /><br />The black Wiimote feels and functions superbly.  Sure, it's the same as the white one albeit differently colored, but the blackness just gives it a supreme look--in my opinion, at least.  The front side with the majority of the buttons has a glossy finish, which emits a radiant shine, whilst the back side with the battery door has a matte look and feel.  The gloss may get dirty in the long run with fingerprints and skin oil, but for now it's staying shiny.  The black rubber jackets may eventually attract dust and lint, but, again, for now they're as clean as can be.<br />Also, and this may just be the fact that it's still new, the speaker sounds louder and crisper than my other Wiimotes' speakers.  I thought I accidentally had it on a louder setting, but when I checked my Wii it was the same setting as my white ones, so I figured Nintendo improved the sound chips.<br /><br />In this package you get the Wiimote, MotionPlus, batteries, wrist strap and two rubber jackets--one to hold the MotionPlus and one to hold the Wiimote without (which I'm currently using for New Super Mario Bros. Wii).  Plus, you end up saving on this bundle over the white set, which can only be purchased separately as of this review.  On Amazon.com, you'll end saving $5 or so.<br /><br />All in all, it's the same ol' Wiimote, but in black.  It has that new, stiff button feel, which I personally like, but give it some time to break in.<br />If you like black, opt for this controller.  This is my "special" one that no one but me will use; friends and family can use my other white ones.<br /><br />Oh, and Nintendo has some blue and pink bundles coming in February 2010 (but with white jackets and MotionPluses).

Nice, but thicker jacket may not work with inductive chargers
Nice shiny black Wiimote with motionplus -- what's not to like?<br /><br />One issue though is the jacket is a little thicker than the old clear ones, and seems to block charging with the Nyko inductive charger (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NIJWEM">Wii Charge Base Induction Charger</a>), as of December 2009 anyway.  If you actually use the jackets and have an inductive charger, you might want to wait for this to get resolved.

i didn't NEED another wiimote ...
okay, i admit it.  i only got a black wiimote & nunchuck because for the coolness factor, and i honestly felt a little silly for doing so.<br /><br />no more!  the matte finish on the back make the controls more comfortable to a surprising degree.  it was a doubly nice surprise since i didn't know about the matte finish.  if you play without a jacket or skin, this is a serious bonus.<br /><br />another shock was how clear the wiimote's speaker sounds, compared to my originals.<br /><br />the one tiny downside -- i'm using rechargable wiimote packs, the kind that comes with new battery covers.  since these are white and glossy, they ruin the look and feel of the black wiimote.  hopefully Energizer will make ones that match at some point, but for now i'll stick with AAs<br /><br />as for other accessories, the black wiimote & nunchuck look really darn cool in the white Zapper gun ...

Wii motion Bundle a good package for Wii enthusiasts
The Wii motionplus bundle is a good deal for two reasons: 1) It saves you money on 3 items that would cost a lot more if each one was bought separately 2) The black remote makes its white predecessor pale in comparison in the looks department.<br /><br />The motionplus add-on is a must if you play games such as Wii sports resort, EA sports active, Wii fit etc. that rely almost completely on motion tracking for gameplay. Playing fitness games without them can be frustrating when you are waving your controller frantically trying to get a response, while your character is in a world of their own. However, you can easily get away without the motionplus in other games like Metroid or The Legend of Zelda, but it's still a welcome addition nonetheless. <br /><br />The controller works fine and has given me absolutely no problems so far. If you're considering skipping the motionplus to save some money, my advice is not to do so. Most of the newer games are almost required to have the motionplus and it seems to be a trend that will continue well into the future as long as the Wii console remains viable. <br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a worthwile investment if you need an extra controller for your Wii console.<br /><br />

A better Wii Remote experience.
Nintendo's Wii Remote has proved to be quite the revolutionary thing. It provided a new and fresh experience, and, with the help of Wii Sport, sold the Wii to millions of homes. It has an Infrared Pointer, motion sensing accelerometers, and a mini speaker on the front. The Wiimote has since been proven as a flashlight, a light saber, a katana, a steering wheel, a gun, etc.   <br /><br />Now what you get in this neat $50 package is one black Wiimote along with a black newly redesigned "vest", "jacket", "sleeve", or "condom" for use with the stock Wiimote (sans Wii Motion Plus). You also get a black Wii Motion Plus device and a redesigned jacket for use with the Wiimote and the Motion Plus.<br /><br />The Wii Motion plus addition here is a big deal for several reasons. First of all, is the fact that this device has a stand alone price of $20, and when combined with the stand alone Wiimote ($40), you end up paying $10 more than what you would have you bought this combo pack. Second, is that Wiimotion Plus has become a new standard for several games, and more are being made all the time. Said games will REQUIRE motion plus to play, so you might as well get it now. <br /><br />Several games that require or are enhanced with WIIMotion Plus are <br />-Wii Sports Resort<br />-Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10<br />-Grand Slam Tennis<br />-Red Steel 2<br /><br />One of the first things people will notice about this new remote is obviously the color. Nintendo has swapped the sleek iPod inspired white for a very sexy black. The buttons have remained the same color (red for power, blue for Home), but those match very fluidly with the new black exterior. <br /><br />The functionality is the same, there are no new features, no noticeable improvements, at least on the technical side. The actual plastic material has been changed though, for the better. The top side remains with a glossy finish, but the underside, instead of mere plastic, there is now a very nice matte finish. It provides a better grip, and you'll find yourself with less sweaty hands. (note that this may be case with new White Wiimotes as well, but this is the first Wiimote ive bought in 2 years, so i wouldn't know).<br /><br />All in all, im very happy with my purchase. You get a Wiimote, WM+, and two "jackets" for just $50. You save some cash, and bag the WM+ that will be eventually needed.

Great Bundle
This came with TWO black silicone skins, one for the wiimote without teh wii-motion-plus,a nd one that fits over both.<br /><br />The wii-motion plus is great, it makes all games that receive motion info, accept your moves a little more realistically, and it allows for the nanchaku to be inserted under it.<br /><br />The  Black wii-mote has a sort of matte-finish on the bottom of it, removing the need for any grips.<br /><br />Overall, it is just as good, if not better, than the older white wii-motes, and it shows almost no dead skin gnk that the other wii-motes do...<br /><br />If you want a new wii-mote... I wold suggest getting this one... It rocks!

Love the Pink and Blue Colors
I purchased one of the pink and blue Wii MotionPlus Bundle's.  I love the color.  The color is true to the picture--on the blue it is like a turquoise.  It would be nice if the MotionPlus was the same color as the wiimote--but it is still nice the way it is.<br /><br />The Bundle comes with 2 clear skins--one to use if the motionplus is attached and one to use if it is not.<br /><br />I also like having the different colors as it is easier to know who's remote is whose right away.<br /><br />And, I think the colors are fun!!  I personally like the blue better than the pink--but i like them both.<br /><br />When you have the bundle, it is great to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZJBVW0">Wii Energizer Flat Panel 4x Induction Charger</a> as it can charge the units while the motionplus is on rather than having to take it on and off.  Just a helpful item that i discovered because i hate to take those MotionPlus things off.

Duh!
The Motion Plus is virtually free at the current sale price, there's no tax and shipping is free ... Ummm, What's not to like? <br /><br />Need another Wiimote ... get this one. Simple.

It's black! It's a wiimote!
I'm glad that this black wiimote comes with the motionplus bundle and silicone sleeve that fits around the motion plus. If you have a white motionplus wiimote, you know what to expect here. It is black. It is a wiimote. <br /><br />You also get a silicone sleeve that fits around just the normal old wiimote part, too. I liked that the wrist strap was black as well.<br /><br />I decided to get two blacks to go with my two working white ones, so that I can have four controllers that all look slightly different: black with black skin, white with white skin, black with white skin, white with black skin. Now everyone knows which is "their" wiimote.<br />

Works Great!
Product works great.  We now have three Wii remotes and the black remotes is the one of choice for the kids.  The Wii MotionPlus and nunchucks works just as well as the original.  If you are looking for a way to differiate your remotes, this remote is a great choice.

Wii MotionPlus Bundle is Great for this Retiree
I had originally gotten my girlfriend her own Wii system with a balance board and the Sports Resort games, which require the MotionPlus system attachments.<br /><br />Well, long story short, we were having so much fun playing the games and laughing like little kids, not to mention getting good exercise, that I decided to get my own set for my place.<br /><br />Now I have my own setup with two MotionPlus controllers and can be found practicing my golf swing, bowling, archery skills, and much more in my living room.  The MotionPlus controller attachment seems to make the controller much more accurate...almost too accurate.  I can't get away with anything!  If I put too much spin on a ball, it curves, if I slice my shot a little it veers.  These little guys are like musical instruments...they won't lie to you...if you do a good job, you'll be rewarded and poor technique will be on display for correction.<br /><br />The real and almost hidden benefit is that while you're 'playing', you're actually using your brain, nervous system, senses, and muscles.  This has been one of the biggest and most fun improvements to my general health and happiness in a very long time.<br /><br />You will only regret buying it if you don't use it.  Otherwise, you'll be having a blast and using parts you didn't know you had...and getting better at it too!<br /><br />Good luck and have fun!

too cute!
We were in need of some new wii remotes when I found they now come in different colors!  The pink is so cute!  The motion plus bundle part takes some getting used to...it's pretty big on the bottom.  But you can take it off if you want.  We love the silicon covers as well and it comes with 2, one for the regular remote and one for it with the motionplus pack.  I was very happy with the purchase.

Not a game, but a controller, official one at that!
Pre-ordered this off Amazon with free shipping, arrived days before the date estimated which is awesome. The new color looks great but the Japanese version has a blue glove where the US still has a transparent one that is bundled with the white controllers. It will come with Batteries, a regular glove and then a 2nd glove that has the motion plus in it.  Tried it out and worked perfectly as it should. Great quality control as Nintendo demands. Motion Plus tested fine with Wii Sports Resort.

Save money by purchasing the Wii Remote MotionPlus Bundle!
This is great. The product works perfectly. I love it in different colors (especially when using regular/rechargeable batteries). Usually I may forget to charge so I have a remote in black, white, pink and blue. By doing this, I know by color which remote may need charging. May sound silly to some by hey... it works for me! lol! <br /><br />Also, this bundle is great. According to Amazon pricing, you can buy a white Wii remote for $39.99 and if you need the Wii MotionPlus adapter, it will cost an additional $19.99. Of course that's $60 bucks. So by buying this bundle, you save approx. $10 per remote!<br /><br />Plus, if you don't already have Wii Sports resort, you can purchase that because it comes with a FREE Wii MotionPlus adapter for the white Wii remote that comes with the game console! So in turn, you get the game and adapter cheaper than if you were to buy the Wii Sports resort game and a Wii MotionPlus adapter separately. I know... I know... I talk to much! :-)<br /><br />Bottomline, works great and great price! :-)

Great controller and great deal.
I had been waiting for a different color remote for a long time. When the black one became available I wanted to purchase it right away. Everyone fights for the black controller now. It is the sweetest looking one even though the only difference is the fact that it is black and the sleeve is also black. The greatest thing is the controller comes with the motion plus basically for free since a standard controller is the same price. You also get the standard black sleeve for when you are not using the motion plus. Using the motion plus is noticably different than if you use the controller by itself. The movement response is quicker and more accurate than with the controller alone. As far as battery life, I have used the controller for also a month now and have not had to change the batteries even after 24+ hours of use. Excellent buy.

Great combo pack in a cool color
There's not a whole lot to say about this controller set that you wouldn't already know from previously using the standard white controllers.  I will, however, say that the black glossy finish on the face of the controller is extremely attractive, and brings a whole new life to the Wii controller.  This combo pack includes the MotionPlus attachment which, while not currently supported by a lot of games, will be seeing more and more use in the near future.  It also includes 2 opaque black Nintendo branded rubber "jackets" for the controller (1 for use with the MotionPlus, 1 without), a black wrist strap, and 2 AA batteries (a nice little bonus in a world where companies are usually cutting corners).<br /><br />Like all Nintendo hardware products, this thing is built like a rock.  While using the rubber jackets is not required, it will help to extend the life of these controllers even further (although I'm still using my two white controllers that I got on launch day for the Wii, never put them in a jacket and they're going strong).<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that if Nintendo is selling this product as a bundle, why can't they simply build that MotionPlus functionality into the original controller's form factor?  The added width from the MotionPlus attachment forces you to remove the attachment whenever you want to play games that require you to hold the controller horizontally, like New Super Mario Bros.  It just seems silly to feel like I always have to swap the attachments on and off whenever I want to play something like Wii Sports Resort.<br /><br />Despite this one little issue, this bundle is a fantastic value, I highly purchasing one (or more) of these if you don't yet have 4 controllers for the Wii but would like to round out your collection.

well, I have this remote..bought it because it made sense to get another controller for the Wii and get the motion plus for [...] ...have not used the motion plus feature yet (don't have the games that require it, yet) but thought it may be worth the $[..] to possibly try out in the future....the remote itself is just a little classier(black with glossy face) version of the original...it works just fine, so far....<br /><br />   it's hard to put a value conscious review on this type of equipment, because the prices are ever-changing and your opinion could change in a hurry, if you started to have issues down the road (how well it holds up over time)

Love the Pink and Blue Colors
We needed to extra remotes and the motion plus piece--buying it together saved money AND as an added bonus, the blue and pink colors are awesome.  Much better than the boring white.  They are made by wii and work just as good as the original white ones.<br /><br />The other advantage to having different colors is it is much easier to know who's remote is whose.<br /><br />But mostly, the colors just make me smile.<br /><br />These do come with 2 skins--one that works with the MotionPlus on and one that works with it off.  The skins are both clear, as in the picture.<br /><br /><br />When you have the bundle, it is great to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZJBVW0">Wii Energizer Flat Panel 4x Induction Charger</a> as it can charge the units while the motionplus is on rather than having to take it on and off.  Just a helpful item that i discovered because i hate to take those MotionPlus things off.

Excellent remotre and good value, but may not need the MotionPlus?
I purchased this controller bundle when I purchased my Wii.  Unfortunately I have only played the Wii Sports, Mario Kart Wii and Super Mario Wii and none of them utilize the MotionPlus device.  So in short, if you are just now purchasing a Wii and looking at accessories I would hold off on buying the MotionPlus until you know you will use/need it!   I have been playing without it installed on the remote because the remote is more comfortable without the Motion Plus attached to it!<br /><br />

Wii Remote MotionPlus Bundle - Black
I love my black controller I know which one is mine and the kids do too. No more dead batteries every time I go to use a remote because I am the only one that is allowed to use the BLACK one. DADS rule # 1 DAD rules! <br />The motion plus is cool too.

We love it!
I like the new black.  I have two white and two black,works well when we team up on games.  We have not had any problems with them.

Wii remote in PINK
Pink remote much better than a cover or "skin" to add color.  Works well for identifying whose remote, especially for children.

Just another way Wii is the best!
I mostly purchased this because I wanted to have 2 controllers for my Wii and ws absolutely in love with the color choices. Once I got it home and used it I was happily surprised. The fact that it also comes with 2 protective sleeves ( one for when the motion plus is attached and one for when it is not. I would reccommed this product to anyone with a Wii, not only is it a great addition to the system but it oens up more gaming choices as well.

Take that Balance Board out of the closet
If you're like me, you got the Wii Fit, used it a few times, and put it in the closet once the novelty wore off. <br /><br />The best thing to happen to the Wii Fit was a little something called EA Sports Active. It was released by Electronic Arts a few months ago, and they raised the bar for what a fitness title should look like. The influence of EA Sports Active on Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus is very apparent, and the Nintendo folks did a great job of taking Wii Fit to the next level.<br /><br />The first thing to note is that Wii Fit Plus is not a "sequel" to the original Wii Fit, but rather it contains all the content of the original Wii Fit and adds a number of improvements. In other words, if you don't have Wii Fit already, you can skip it, buy Wii Fit Plus with the Balance Board. If you already have Wii Fit, you can buy the Wii Fit Plus game only.<br /><br />For those with the old Wii Fit, the conversion of your old profile data to the new is quick and seamless. It just takes a couple seconds and voila, all of your old weight data and workout data is available in Wii Fit Plus.<br /><br />The first improvement, clearly influenced by EA Sports Active, is that instead of choosing individual strength and yoga exercises ad-hoc, you can choose from a number of pre-configured workout routines. "My Wii Fit Plus" is a virtual locker room, where your animated balance board (as chipper and encouraging as ever) walks you through the process of choosing a workout routine based on any number of specific goals, ranging from better health to improving specific parts of your body. <br /><br />The activities are still broken out by category: Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics, and Balance Games. All of these are identical to the old Wii Fit, except that there there are a 6 new Yoga and Strength training exercises which add some more variety and challenge to those categories.<br /><br />But here's the part of the review I'm sure you've been waiting for. The biggest improvement in Wii Fit Plus is the addition of 15 "Training Plus" activities.<br /><br />Perfect 10 (Workout intensity: 2 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): A game that tests your math skills as much as your flexibility. Numbers will appear on giant mushroom, and you bump your hips to hit the numbers that add (or subtract) to 10 or 15 or 20. You won't be losing huge amounts of weight from this one, but it's a great way to test your mind and body coordination and this is one you'll play over and over again to try to beat your high score. <br /><br />Island Cycling (Workout intensity: 4 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): This is a game that uses the Balance Board (you step on the board with your left and right foot to simulate bicycle pedalling) and the Wiimote (which you use to steer). The game itself looks a lot like the cycling game on Wii Sports Resort, except you move your feet instead of your hands. Unlike that game, this game isn't timed; rather, you need to cycle around a large island collecting flags. The island is beautifully designed with amazing details. This is definitely one you can spend a lot of time on and not even realize you were exercising.<br /><br />Rhythm Kung-Fu (Workout intensity: 3 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This is the first game that put a huge smile on my face. Using your Wiimote, the Nunchuk, and the Balance Board, you have to strike different "kung fu" poses in rhythm to delightfully cheesy kung-fu movie music. It's essentially a game of "Simon Says", where you mimic the moves of a groups of Miis standing behind you (and if you have family or friend Miis on your system, you'll see some familiar faces).<br /><br />Driving Range (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): Sure, golf has been done in Wii Sports, in Wii Sports Resort, and in games like Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Wii Fit Plus brings something a little different to the table, though. You position the Balance Board vertically, and swing your Wii-mote like a golf club. There's a "swing analyzer" which is surprisingly good not just for casual video game golfers but also for real golfers to analyze their form. It measures the straightness of your swing, your weight distribution, and gives a pretty good indication of how far your drive will go. <br /><br />Segway Circuit (Workout intensity: 3 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): In a clever co-branding deal, Nintendo teamed up with the folks at Segway for this game. In it, you ride a Segway around the island trying to pop balloons that are being put up around the island by pesky moles. Like a real Segway, you lean forward to move forward and you lean back to go back, steering with the Wii-mote. <br /><br />Bird's-Eye Bull's-Eye, a.k.a. Flying Chicken (Workout intensity: 5 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This is the one you probably heard about, and it (along with Obstacle Course) is the winner. Your Mii dons a chicken outfit and has to fly from target to target. How do you fly? By flapping your arms. You can either flap your arms with your hands extended, or do a "chicken dance" type movement by bending your elbows. Either way, the Balance Board will amazingly detect how strongly, quickly, or slowly you're flapping. Like a real bird, you flap faster to get better control, and you flap slower to soar great distances. You control where you're moving by leaning on the Balance Board. <br /><br />Snowball Fight (Workout intensity: 2 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This one is just plain fun. You use the Wii-mote to shoot snowballs at an invading army of Miis (again, if you have custom Miis stored on your system you'll see some familiar faces), and duck left and right to hide behind a barricade to avoid getting hit yourself with snowballs. <br /><br />Obstacle Course (Workout intensity: 5 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This is the game I was most looking forward too, and I was not disappointed. You run in place on the Balance Board to make your character move forward and you straighten your knees to make him jump. In the process, you'll be navigating around huge swinging wrecking balls, moving sidewalks, and falling logs.<br /><br />Tilt City (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 3 of 5): I admit, I'm not so crazy about these "tilt" games, maybe because I'm just not very coordinated. This is a game where you need to tilt the Wii-mote and shift your weight on the balance board in a coordinated fashion to steer colored balls into the right container. <br /><br />Rhythm Parade (Workout intensity: 4 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This was another one to put a huge smile on my face. You're basically a drum major, marching in place to the sound of a beat. Like rhythm games like Helix and Samba Di Amigo, you move your Wii-mote and Nunchuk to match on-screen cues. The better you match, the bigger your marching band becomes (and again, you'll see familiar faces join in the band if you have custom Miis).<br /><br />Big Top Juggling (Workout intensity: 3 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): No, this one won't really teach you how to juggle, but once you're done you'll have the same satisfaction as if you did know how. It's a game where you have to stay balanced on a giant ball (using your feet on the Balance Board), while at the same time keeping 1, 2, or 3 balls in the the air by flicking your Wii-mote and Nunchuk. <br /><br />Skateboard Arena (Workout intensity: 4 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): This seems like a pretty fair representation of riding a skateboard. You position the Balance Board vertically and stand on it like a skateboard. You can build speed by pushing off your back foot. You steer by moving your body back and forth, and you can jump by straightening your knees. You go through a series of exercises just like a real skateboarder, from jumping on ramps to riding on rails to doing tricks on half-pipes.<br /><br />Table Tilt Plus (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 3 of 5): This one is a lot like those labyrinth games where you're trying to steer a ball around holes (in this case, you're trying to get balls into holes). <br /><br />Balance Bubble Plus (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 2 of 5): Same sentiments as I wrote above. This is an improved version of the old Wii Fit Balance game where you're floating in a bubble trying to navigate your way through a maze.  <br /><br />Basic Run Plus (Workout intensity: 5 of 5, Fun 3 of 5): This is a variation of the jogging game in the Aerobic games section of Wii Fit Plus. Like that game, you control this one by running in place on the Balance Board, and you're treated to a lot of great scenery and new paths to explore on Wii Fit Island. An added feature is that at the end of the game, you'll be quizzed on things you saw, which is added to your final score, which surprisingly makes the run a lot more interesting, as you make sure to carefully observe every little detail as you're running.<br /><br />Other improvements:<br /><br />1) The use of METs and report of calories burned. What does METs stand for? METs (which stands for Metabolic EquivalenTs) is a standard way to measure energy expenditure. One annoyance with the old Wii Fit was that whether you did an exercise that used no energy like a stretching exercise or one that expended vast amounts of energy like Super Hula Hoop, your progress was marked by the time spent or "Fit Credits" that didn't mean anything in the real world. With Wii Fit Plus, METs are used in conjunction with your body weight and the time spent to calculate the number of calories burned. There's even a neat little function in My Wii Fit Plus where you can see the number of calories you've burned in terms of food (you can even choose the type and amount of food you want to burn off and set it as a goal).<br /><br />2) Balance Board improvements. With the old Wii Fit, each time you started a new routine, you'd need to wait for the Balance Board to calibrate. I suppose this was intended in the case where multiple people would be sharing the Balance Board, but it got annoying very fast. Wii Fit Plus is a bit more intelligent, in that it'll sense whether the weight has changed and give the option to recalibrate only if it has. I've experienced a number of "false positives" in which it thought my weight changed when it didn't, but that's just a minor annoyance compared to the old way. I was actually a bit puzzled as to why the Wii MotionPlus wasn't used in this game, but with the improvements to the Balance Board they really weren't necessary.<br /><br />3) The ability to measure a child or pet. This is a gimmick, of course, but a totally fun one if you have the aforementioned child or pet to measure. :)<br /><br />Overall, Wii Fit Plus is a winner. To Nintendo's credit, they weren't content just to rest on their laurels, but they came up with improvements that truly breathed new life into the Wii Fit.

What's old is new again! And fun!
Like another reviewer, I couldn't wait for shipping so I picked this up at a local store.  I had long made up my mind that for the price, I was definitely getting this title even if it started to receive mixed reviews. <br /><br />For those that currently have the Wii Fit, Nintendo has kept most of the same old familiar menus and music (and yes, the words of encouragement that are helpful the first time, but repetitive and annoying after that - no change there).<br /><br />However, they've added lots of cool things.  This is not a comprehensive list, but just my initial review and thoughts on a few of them.  There are 15 new balance games and they are just plain fun.  A few of my early favorites: <br /><br />- Rhythm Parade.  I almost skipped over this one because of the title but it's a fun little musically themed 3 minute (at the beginner level) activity that has you marching and "drumming" with your Wiimote and nunchuk. I quickly warmed up and the minutes were over before I knew it.  I enjoy this more than the Hula Hoop activity and it makes you move the entire time. <br /><br />- Island Cycling.  Looks like the environment from the Run modules, but you're on a bike this time.  You use the Wiimote sideways to steer (a la MarioKart) and walk on the board to simulate pedaling.  The faster you walk, the faster you bike. <br /><br />- The Training interface. For the first time, you can customize your workout.  You pick from Yoga or Strength exercises (no Balance, though) and customize your workout.  Wii Fit Plus will tally up the minutes and you can save the routine.  If you click on the animated Balance Board he'll ask you how much time you have and put together a routine for you.  You can also pick one of the routines for a specific target area, e.g. entire figure, posture, etc.  These are all brief (6-9 minutes) but interesting and beneficial. <br /><br />- Pet and child weight support.  Got a pudgy child or pet?  In my case, I have a fat chihuahua (really!) and am actively trying to slim him down.  Since I'm looking to exercise and trim a few pounds myself, this works out.  I can now weigh myself AND him and keep a running time line of our respective losses.  This all sounds silly, but will be well used by me.  It motivates me to weigh him as much as I weigh myself and make sure he is trending down, not up.  I would imagine Nintendo did some research here and realized that this would be a valuable feature. <br /><br />- Quick stats option.  When you're doing a body test, you can simply do a BMI and weight quickly without all the fluff using the Quick stats option.  This is good for people who like to weigh-in before work, but do their workout sometime later in the day.<br /><br />- Calories for food.  This is a bit over the top, but it's cute.  The game asks you to pick a target calorie loss per day in terms of a food item (in my case, it's a 190 calorie vanilla ice cream cone).  All throughout the workout, you tick down the calories toward your "goal". <br /><br />All in all, it's a solid game.  You can't beat it for the price.  It's a marked upgrade and will entirely replace the current Wii Fit disc.  All of the original games, yoga, and strength moves are included on this disc. <br /><br />Enjoy!<br />

Wii Fit Fun all over again
(Updated for questions) <br />I couldn't wait for shipping - so I grabbed this game this morning as I was doing my early Sunday shopping. I even got a chance to throw it in for a little while before the football games started :)<br /><br />True, I've only tested it out this morning, but I thought I would leave a few comments for those of you wondering what's the difference between plus and regular fit.  I bought it for the new games mostly, and thankfully so, not too many new exercises but they seem to all be accessible (beginner level at least) but it imports your wii fit data - so maybe that has something to do with what's accessible or not.<br /><br />It has a new menu item for 15 new plus games and it will build a workout for you in a few different increments or customized with yoga and strength exercises (no games).<br /><br />It allows you to switch players more dynamically so you can play it with friends and family.  You can even get babies and pets a quick fit profile (why I'm not sure but we had a laugh)<br /><br />As a lefty, I was happy to see that you are able to choose left handed / right handed and for the games like driving range and skateboarding, you can choose your stance side (?) (ex - goofy foot or regular) which makes it more comfortable to play.  <br /><br />The swing analysis (driving range) on the driving range cracks me up - but is very helpful. <br /><br />It seems pretty subtle in the impact of the motion plus controller - but the new games are pretty fun thus far.  <br /><br />The exercises are pretty much as the original wii fit worked - same trainers, same exercises plus a few new yoga and strength - I didn't notice any new aerobics activities.<br /><br />For the $20, you receive a decent selection of new games and a few new exercises - now what do I do with the old Wii Fit disc? Lol.  If you liked the previous games (aerobics / balance games) I think it's worth the $20. The new workout option is nice but I can tell I will stick to EA Active for workouts - so maybe rent it before you buy it if that's your preference.

Finally got my girlfriend playing
My favorite feature of Wii Fit Plus is that it finally got my girlfriend playing. Despite my own use of the Wii Fit for months now, she'd always just maintained she didn't like video games and refused, yet she just spent over an hour playing balance games and flapping her arms around. I think part of the credit goes to how much easier it is to switch Miis in this version -- rather than having to almost entirely exit the program, Plus makes it easy to switch Miis back and forth while playing; "here, you want to try?" became a matter of two button presses rather than ten, and that was enough. I think several of the new balance games also were more appealing to her -- more challenging and more entertaining than the games she'd seen me play before.<br /><br />Even discounting that, though, this game definitely contains enough improvements to be well worth the $20. There are three new "Yoga" and three new "Strength" exercises; I personally found the new "yoga" positions excellent stretches and the new "strength" ones less worthwhile, but your mileage may vary. I greatly appreciate the ability to see a measurement of how many calories each exercise is burning; as an ice cream fan, it's pretty amusing (and informative) to be told exactly how much farther I have to go to burn off that hot fudge sundae (425 cal.), and I wonder how many people will be surprised to find out how their exercise correlates to their activity (no more "well, I ran for five minutes, so that means I get a triple-patty cheeseburger (770 cal)". <br /><br />The interface is more streamlined, and I appreciate the "go directly to Wii Fit Plus" doorway on the startup screen, and the quick stats check at the beginning. The preconfigured workout routines are little more than a few minute's worth for each goal, and most people will probably reconfigure their own workouts; thankfully, the Plus gives the option to do that (although only Yoga and Strength exercises can be fit into the user-planned workouts, not balance games or the new Training Plus games, and rearranging your workout list is a little cumbersome).This isn't a huge change, but it's convenient, and an improvement.<br /><br />Other reviews go into a game-by-game breakdown of each minigame, so I won't cover that here. Suffice to say, there are a lot of them, and I expect that these additions will revive my Wii Fit usage for the next month or two at least, which I consider worth the $20. I especially appreciated that there were more games that emphasized upper-body workouts -- flapping my arms like a chicken isn't just fun, it's also mild-but-decent shoulder exercise, and I like having more upper-body options.<br /><br />I did notice one apparent bug; the Rhythm Kung Fu game seemed slightly "off", sometimes registering a "perfect" for multi-part moves when I had only completed the first movement. This is a minor issue, and I imagine it will be fixed soon enough (if it isn't a problem unique to my own experience), but if it is a general bug it might be a reason to wait, especially if your Wii cannot download Nintendo's patches. <br /><br />Now I just have to get her to let me play it again!

The Price is right and free play is great.
The number one best thing about this addition in my book is the free play option on the Bike ride. If, like me, you have followed every dog in order to make your Wii run less boring, here is your chance to explore the island at your own pace and speed and go most of the places you have wanted to see, all while pursuing a 30 minute workout that is as stressful as you wish to make it. Though it subtracts from your time, you can even relax by the water for a few! To open the free ride just get reasonably good at the Beginner ride. Earning three stars and four or five twos opened the free ride for me. <br /><br />I haven't played all the games, but the chicken flying game in which you flap your arms to hit a target is great fun, especially with a few friends and libations. I also liked the skateboard and like someone else said, the Drum Major routine is fun. I was surprised that I liked it because I never liked the step sequences in the original or some of the boxing routines that involved stepping, but the marching routine was great fun.<br /><br />I do agree that the person who was disappointed in the "training area". If your main attraction was to creating a workout using all of your favorite activities, don't get the game. As noted in the other review the choices are very limited and I doubt I will use that feature even though I looked forward to it initially. However, for what it does provide at a cost of under $20, it is well worth the price of admission..

Get up off the couch and Wii!
Wii Fit Plus, that is!  I couldn't wait to try this new title because I enjoy and use the first one so much. When you start it up, the Plus goes and gets all your info and stats from the older version and brings them right into the game, so you can continue right where you left off, but with lots of new games and features.  This is well worth the $20 just for the 15 new games.<br /><br />There are lots of nice new features with this Wii Fit Plus.  I always wished I could set up routines instead of having to move from one menu to the next after each exercise, or that there were ready made routines that I could follow involving several exercises.  With the Plus this is possible.  You start in the locker room and select from Wii Fit Plus Routines, My Routine, or the Favorites menu.  You go to another screen to decide what parts of your body or what type of goals you want to pursue and the difficulty level and length of time.  Then the system will set up a routine designed just for you and your goals.  I think it's much more efficient to go through exercises this way.  You can also compare how you did each day and how much you're improving.  There's a multiplayer mode so that more than one person can play, but you do have to take turns.  Still, it's nice to not have to 'log out' each time a different person wants to play.<br /><br />Another new feature is that you can add babies or pets to the Plus.  I have a big fat long haired 'mini' dachshund that was too embarrassed to be weighed today, but that pupper is going to get weighed tomorrow!  They don't get to do body tests or play any games, but you can keep track of their weight and record it in their stats.  Useful?  Well, maybe not so much but big points for the cuteness factor.<br /><br />I love the games because it's such a great way to get exercise without even realizing it and the 15 new ones in this title are just as good as the old if not better than the first edition.  Want to learn to walk and chew gum at the same time?  One of these games will have you balancing on a big red and white striped ball (your Wii Fit board) while juggling smaller balls thrown to you by your assistants.  Or how about Rhythm Parade where you march and raise and lower your hands on cue and in time with the music?  Tilt City has you using your Wiimote turned sideways and the balance board to maneuver dropping balls into one of three color coordinated pails.  It's easy at first, but when several different colored balls start dropping at once, it's a challenge.  I love the balance games and if you're a fan of the balance board game with the little balls in the first game, there's one here that uses some different colored slots to "pop" the balls up over small obstacles and into the hole.  You control their movement by leaning in different directions on the balance board. <br /><br />There are also 3 new yoga activities and 3 new strength training activities.  That's not to say that some of the games don't improve strength and muscles.  There is one game where you flap your arms like wings to fly from one target post to another over water to get points on each one.  This is one where you want to draw all the curtains because you'll look completely ridiculous standing there on your balance board wildly flapping your arms like some kind of a crazy bird.  But you won't believe how tired your arm muscles feel afterward and you don't even notice while you're busy flying from one target to another.  There's another game, Island Cycling, where you step on the balance board to simulate pedaling a bike, trying to pass Wii flags where you accumulate points.  You steer with the Wiimote held sideways.  I was surprised how sore my calves were afterward, trying to control the speed of the bike.<br /><br />When you can get exercise while doing something that's challenging and fun without even realizing that you're exercising, that's a successful game.  That's why I bought the Wii to begin with and this game takes full advantage of the balance board and all the interactive features.  Can I walk and chew gum at the same time after playing these games?  Well, maybe not yet but I can bust big blue and white balloons by running into them with my Segway on a beach and get almost halfway through the course inside a big ol' bubble in Balance Bubble Plus.  Great job, Nintendo!  Two thumbs up!<br /><br /><br /><br />

What you wanted in Wii Fit the first time
Wii Fit Plus lets you create a custom Yoga/Strength workout routine - placing all your favorite workouts in a menu so there's no stopping after each one to select a new workout. <br /><br />Importing your Wii Fit profiles works as expected - we had 6 and they all transferred fine. Wii Fit Plus lets you add baby and pet profiles - not useful, but cute.<br /><br />I just got it yesterday so I've only played the skateboard game, but they look fun, worth the $20 just for those. <br /><br />There's small mental challenges, like after you run, it asks if you remember seeing certain things, and a balance test has you only move if the number is 4 or less. Not hard, but requires a tiny bit more thought.<br /><br />Definitely a good purchase. I just wish they'd done this stuff originally!

I Got Some Exercise!
I bought Wii Fit Plus with a little trepidation, but I figured for the price (I already have Wii Fit and the Balance Board), I wouldn't lose much if the game was awful.  I am glad I bought it.  Like others mentioned, the Wii Fit got old pretty quickly; I've had it for a year, but only used it regularly for the first 6 months I had it.  When I bought Sport Active at the end of May, I never even thought of the Balance Board or Wii Fit.  However, Wii Fit Plus had definitely reunited me with the Balance Board.  <br /><br />I won't mention all the particulars because others have so generously used their time to talk about the details.  Nonetheless, I will say this: Wii Fit Plus got me sweating!  I use Sport Active on the hard level, 6 days a week.  I will now use it only 4-5 days a week and use Wii Fit Plus on the weekends.  The first time I "played" I picked my own routine and it ended up being 37 minutes long.  By the time I was done, I was sweating very heavily (and I'm in pretty good condition and not overweight).  I really liked how you can pick what you want to work on in your custom routine.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, I would say "Buy it," especially if you already have a Balance Board.  For the price, there's almost nothing to lose and definitely fun and some fitness to gain.

Wii Fit Plus is Awesome!
WII FIT PLUS FEATURES:<br /><br />OBSTACLE COURSE - This is a fun, simple game which reminds me of Mario games.. but you're actually Mario! You get to run around, jump, dodge obstacles and make it through new stages.<br /><br />RHYTHM KUNG-FU - I love this one! It's fun and you get to do kung fu with a beat. You have to do it on time and you get to do different poses and punches.<br /><br />SKATEBOARD ARENA - This is a great game, because you get to skateboard! You get to jump and push off the wii board do tricks on the half-pipes. Very realistic!<br /><br />BIRD'S EYE BULL'S EYE - I love this game! haha, it's funny because you're the flying chicken and you have to flap onto the targets! Great excercising because you have to work to flap!<br /><br />SEGWAY CIRCUIT - This isn't really excercising but it's fun because you get to drive around in a little scooter and pop balloons, but you have to beware of the moles!<br /><br />BASIC RUN PLUS - This is better than the basic run because you get to take different paths following different cats. Also, you get to take a quiz on what you observed such as maybe a mario icon, or how many cats were running past you.<br /><br />RHYTHM PARADE - Wow, this is quite fun... it's like you are actually in a parade and you have to have great timing with this.<br /><br />SNOWBALL FIGHT - Not as much action as I expected, and not as fun.. it's like a first person shooter game where you shoot the people.. not the best.<br /><br />DRIVING RANGE - This is a different approach to golf, where you don't just hit the ball. You learn how to shift your weight and get to practice and nearing the center hole. It's a great way to learn how to place and swing.<br /><br />PERFECT 10 - Haha this is fun.. you need some small math abilities, unless you don't know what numbers add up to 10 then this is not the game for you.. it's fun because you get to swing your hips from side to side and add up to 10. Great game!<br /><br />ISLAND CYCLING - This is like biking, but you're stepping on the wii fit board. It's cool because you can accelerate and you have to collect flags.<br /><br />TILT CITY - This game you need to build coordination, because you have to tilt the wii remote differently than the wii fit board to get the balls into the cups to create fireworks! Pretty fun!<br /><br />TABLE TILT PLUS - Great addition to the table tilt game on the regular wii fit. Trying to get the balls in the holes is much tougher now.<br /><br />BALANCE BUBBLE PLUS - Much harder than balance bubble, but a great challenge because you have to make it through in the dark! Haha.<br /><br />BIG TOP JUGGLING - Not my favorite because it's kind of difficult, but my sister likes it and you have to balance/shift your weight while juggling balls.<br /><br />EXERCISES:<br /><br />3 New Yoga Exercises for Advanced Users.<br />3 New Strength Exercises for Advanced Users. <br /><br />Wii Fit Plus: Tracks how many calories you burned, and you can make your own routines. This way you don't have to keep restarting. Also, it can weigh your pets and has already set routines for your hips or maybe your arms. They also have new body tests, and it is a great addition to your wii.

Nice upgrade to Wii Fit
Wii Fit is excellent.  I've been using it for almost a year now.  Wii Fit Plus is a nice upgrade with 3 new advanced yoga exercises, 3 new advanced strength exercises plus 15 new balance games. Add to that some user improvements and it's an easy 5 star program.<br /><br />Of course using Wii Fit is not equal to jogging 5 miles or spending an hour with weights but for those that don't consider themselves intermediate or advanced athletes the exercises are strenuous enough to improve balance, strength and endurance if used 3 or more times a week.<br /><br />For those that that don't like to exercise the games are worth the price.

Worth the Price
I must admit I had gotten a little bored with the original Wii Fit, so when I saw the Wii Fit Plus in the store I picked it up. Overall this game is very fun and definitely worth the price. As many reviewers have said the addition of the new games is spot on. They keep me coming back every morning (so far). <br /><br />I also have to speak to the problem that I see a few others are having with the new routines. The game allows for you to choose to work on certain areas (health, youth, etc.) and the game will set up a routine that is as long or short as you want. You also have the choice to combine all areas. Nintendo has also given players the option to set up their own routines. Although the routines the game chooses include yoga, strength, aerobics, and the new games, the routines that the player sets up can only include yoga and strength. At first I was a little disappointed by this. But I think, for myself, this is probably for the best. By using the routines the game provides I am getting a nice mix of yoga, strength, and the fun mini-games. If I was dictating my routines I can guarantee that I would cut corners. Besides, it makes it less boring when I don't know what exercise is coming next. I don't know if this is why the makers chose to do it this way or if it is just an oversight in the game but, so far, it works for me. I think Nintendo did an excellent job with the routines and it got me doing some of the strength exercises that I had never done before (oops)!<br /><br />Overall this game is worth the low price tag and it will keep me using the Wii Fit for a while longer.

Loving it!
Sweeeeeeet! I am loving the Wii Fit Plus! Just got it in the mail yesterday from Amazon and I'm impressed with the improvements Nintendo made.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite features:<br />1. My biggest complaint about the original was that I had to use my remote between every exercise and scroll through the menus to what I wanted, making a 30-minute workout into more like 45 or 60 minutes. You can now choose from suggested workouts based on your goals (like shedding some extra calories, slimming your figure or relaxation), or you can customize your own using yoga and strength training. You still need the remote when you use the suggested workouts, but if you make up your own, there is no button pushing so you can put the remote down for the whole time. Plus, it saves the workout you designed so you can use it again and again, or you can easily swap out an exercise or two. **The only thing I'm not crazy about is that the suggested workouts incorporate the balance games and aerobics, but you can't include them in your own customized workout. Still a big improvement, especially since doing the yoga feels more like a flow now instead of pose, stop, pose, stop, etc.<br /><br />2. I love that there's a multiplayer mode so it's easy to play with other people -- but don't get your hopes up too high: You only get to pick from nine games (soccer heading, ski slolam, ski jump, balance bubble, hula hoop, obstacle course, Bird's-Eye Bull's-Eye, driving range and snowball fight).<br /><br />3. I'm really enjoying most of the 15 new games on the Plus, such as rhythm kung fu, the obstacle course, snowball fight, rhythm parade, Segway circuit and a more challenging table tilt. You also get three new strength exercises and three new yoga poses.<br /><br />4. The Plus tracks the approximate number of calories you burn. It also lets you set a goal of how much you'd like to burn in a session as well as a chart to help you see how that might compare to the calories in common foods.<br /><br />5. In the Favorites section, it not only lists the activities you do the most, it also lists what you've done more recently and what you have done the least so you can mix it up more if you want to or stick with the ones you like.<br /><br />6. The Body Test has additional tests that challenge both your balance and your mind. Glad to have a few more things it might throw at me after doing the same tests for the past two months now.<br /> <br />7. Under the Chart menu, it not only tracks your BMI, Weight, Wii Fit Age and Fit Credits (where you can record outside exercise), Nintendo has added a place to record your waist measurement and your steps. <br /><br />The new activities and customizable workouts are a nice boost to my motivation to work out, which I admit was starting to wain. I am also happy with the price of the game; I believe the new features are well worth the $20.

Wii Fit Plus - The Disc That Rocks The Balance Board
I love Wii Fit Plus.  I just bought it yesterday at Walmart.  I have started with just Wii Fit alone, and had found that Nintendo had released this second disc.  This is by far the better of the two.<br /><br />When I first bought my Wii Fit, I used it to do the Body Test every morning.  I continue to do so, and religiously keep track of my weight progress on my wall calendar.  I enjoyed the convenience of the Wii Fit Channel, and have replaced it with the Wii Fit Plus Channel.  I have noticed that Nintendo has obviously made quite a few improvements upon the software.<br /><br />The Body Test experience with the Wii Fit Plus Channel is very similar to the original.  However, when you step on the balance board to be measured for your Center Of Balance and Body Mass Index, the software tells you to keep still.  The original Wii Fit software does not.<br /><br />I also find that some of the exercises on the original Wii Fit you have to unlock by doing others.  I've noticed that this is not true with Wii Fit Plus.  Most of the exercises on Wii Fit Plus start out unlocked, and are never locked.  This way you have a greater choice of exercise activities to choose from when working out with Wii Fit Plus, rather than with original Wii Fit.<br /><br />I am glad that I purchased this software.  It increases my motivation and use of Wii Fit.  If you purchase a copy, you perhaps can follow me down the path of fun and easygoing exercise and weight loss.

Wii Plus is a winner!
Love it! Ever dreamed of flapping your arms and flying? You can with Wii Plus. You can bicycle around WuHu Island, have a snowball fight, or even be a circus juggler. There are target specific workouts to try out. You can customize your own workout or let the Wii board choose for you in five minute increments. Only got a minute to get weighed in? Wii Fit Plus can do that! New is the MET feature and Wii Piggy will keep track of calories burned too. For less than $20, this is a "must have" for Wii Fit owners. Wii motion plus attachment not needed for this program.

great improvement on the original
i absolutely love this game. of course there will always be room for improvement but they are definitely moving in the right direction given the shortcomings in the original - with the exception of super hula hoop, rhythm boxing and the jacknife  or push up challenges i never quite worked up a satisfying sweat or felt that i was truly getting a workout until now. not only that but you can't really underestimate this - i dare you to put your mii in that chicken suit and not turn your arms into spaghetti. the fact that you can customize a workout routine, get an estimation on your calories burned is a welcome addition along with all the new and deceptively challenging games. no one should think this will replace their gym memberships with this or get bowflex ripped but you will have fun and be surprisingly sore the next day. <br /><br />standouts for me include: juggling, skateboarding, rhythm kung fu & island cycling.

Buy it if Only for the New Games!
The Wii Fit Plus is a great addition. It brings over all your information from the regular Wii Fit or you could just buy this. There are several new games which is what our family with kids enjoy. There are also several new excercises in yoga and strength. In addition you can customize a workout so you don't have to move between screens to choose each individual excercise. <br />The games include:<br />A Fun Math Game (Sorry I can't remmeber the name!) - This one is great! The first-grader loves it!!! You swing your hips to make numbers add to ten. (Not sure what the next level is she hasn't made it yet.)<br />Bicycling<br />Kung Fu Rythum<br />Golf<br />Obsticle Course - Very reminiscent of SuperMario 64<br />Marching Band<br />Segaway Course<br />Flying - You take a bird, you flap your arms to move and land on targets.<br />Tilt - Kinda like pinball.<br />And new versions of running, bubble balance, table tilt, and more! No one will consent to let me go to the menu and read to names. They all want to keep playing!

Fun and like to play it all the time!
With the time it takes to drive to the gym and drive back (30 minutes just for driving only), I could have put on my clothes and shoes and taken the iPod, put on my shoes (10 minutes) and gone for a 20 minute run.<br /><br />With the time it takes to put on my clothes and shoes and take the iPod (10 minutes), I could have played Wii Fit Plus: run a short run, played a game of Rhythm Kung Fu, a game of Bubble River, and another game of short run, and take a daily measurement of myself for the weight and BMI.<br /><br />It is really a time saver and very convenient (and fun!) to play the Wii Fit Plus!<br /><br />Nowadays, after waking up, I try to eat something, rest a little bit, like for 20 minutes, and then do 10 to 20 minutes of exercise.  This short amount of exercise already wakes me up.  Then during the day, after some long hours of thinking, then I can come back for another 10 to 20 minutes of fun and exercise.<br /><br />The critical issue here is: it is fun!  And I will keep coming back to it.

Super SUPER Mario Galaxy...
My daughter was 5-years old when we first played the original Super Mario Galaxy.  She would constantly corner me every day so that we could play it over and over, and after we beat it, over and over again.  In fact, I have beaten the original game a total of 10 times with my daughter as my trusty side-kick at the player 2 spot, grabbing stars, freezing bad guys, or shooting the occasional bad guy or gold dot to get me a much needed coin.<br /><br />So imagine our delight when we heard on Amazon.com last June that Super Mario Galaxy 2 was available for pre-order...without a confirmed date, of course, but ready for pre-order nonetheless.<br /><br />Does Super Mario Galaxy 2 hold up?  Does it still manage to capture the heart of a 7-year old girl and her father?  The answer is a resounding YES.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy 2 completely operates in its own right by being a stand-alone story.  The only nod to the previous Galaxy comes in the form of Rosalina who will appear if you have significant difficulty with a level so that she can actually show you how to pass a level (at the cost of getting a bronze, NOT gold star).  Back to the story (or the little of it that there is, a la most Mario games), Princess Peach has been kidnapped by a GIGANTIC Bowser (surprise!).  Naturally, Mario is going to rescue her with the help of star power from master luma (star-like creatures with the capability to transform).<br /><br />Who is there to help Mario this time?  Well, this time Luigi is a playable character later on, as opposed to the original Galaxy which forced you to take the torturous path of collecting all 120 stars before unlocking him.  Yoshi is on board as well, your trusty steed who can eat red-hot peppers to move quickly and cross water no less, or become a blimp full of hot air, or glow to reveal hidden paths.  <br /><br />The biggest change for us as a father-daughter team is that Player 2 has more to do now.  Player 2 is actually an orange luma who follows Mario around.  Now, Player 2 (in addition to freezing enemies and grabbing stars) can actually spin as well to knock enemies to the ground or grab coins from remote places by flying over to them quickly and then bringing them back to Mario.  Also, making Player 2 an actual, tangible entity in the game (as opposed to a mysterious P2 star that has no discernible presence) makes it even more fun for my daughter who gets caught up in the action because the game itself is usually too hard for her as Player 1.  She will actually say things like, "Daddy, you get the one on the right, I'll get the one on the left."  It's extremely hard to pry her away from it when it's time for a story and bed.<br /><br />Has the gameplay changed much?  Well, no, the same mechanics are there.  It's interesting that the game starts off as a 2D sidescrolling event that leads into somewhat a 3D perspective until it's a full-blown 3D adventure.  It's a subtle, baby-step transition and, as an IGN reviewer put it, it pays off in getting those unfamiliar with the original to get into the action.  <br /><br />Despite having the same mechanics of jumping and spinning, Mario has some new powerups.  Cloud Mario can create little tufts of clouds to hop up.  Rock Mario has our hero turning into a solidified boulder to roll around (and even "bowl" to hilarious effect).  Drill Mario allows our hero to drill through to inaccessible areas.  And, of course, there's Yoshi who is able to eat his enemies and use a couple of funny power-ups of his own as previously mentioned.  Bee Mario, Fire Mario, Spring Mario, etc., make their return.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy 2 is smooth, polished and shows the time-dedicated love and attention that was bestowed upon it during its 3-year absence.  It takes the best parts of the original and makes them better while taking away what didn't work the first time.  They have wisely included more for player 2 to do while acknowledging that Mario is still, front and center, the star of the show.  The music is even more fully orchestrated than before.  The attention to detail is phenomenal and showcases Nintendo's desire to never compromise by releasing a product too quickly without undergoing the rigorous quality control that this game clearly had.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a delight for children and even a delight for me as a 37-year old father.  This is my "daughter and me" time, when we share a fun family night (Mommy likes to watch ;D), night-after-night and it is my modern-day Monopoly.  Cheers to Nintendo for taking a winning formula, keeping it more than alive, and breathing fresh ideas into this franchise.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?  Purchase the game...this is one of the flagship titles, and deservedly so.<br /><br />

Better than the original Galaxy, well worth the money
Mario Galaxy 2 builds on the success of Galaxy 1; the premise, controls and basic concept are the same.  Mario has to navigate through different worlds, each incorporating some gravity defying, mind bending challenges.  Every planet is completely new, there are no repeats in the tasks to complete, and with over 240 stars to collect that is no small feat.  <br />This game has several additions, most notably rock Mario, cloud Mario and Yoshi, and returns some of the original game's best (bee Mario and boo Mario).  One difference from the original is that while in the original there was a narrative that ran through the game, that aspect is completely gone in this installment. Of course, there is a basic story which by now you know by heart, Princess Peach is kidnapped and needs to be rescued.  After this is presented the game immerses you in its 3 dimensional nature. <br /> <br />Gameplay:<br />This game is more challenging than the first. It gets you into serious platforming from early on, and while that is a welcome change in the early stages, some of the latter stages can be quite frustrating forcing you to spend quite a bit of time trying to get the one star needed to advance.  There is a "play for me" option that you can use in some of these more frustrating challenges. The only difference is that you get a less lustrous bronze star as opposed to a gold one (letting everyone know that you couldn't complete that challenge on your own". <br />Another change is that there is more 2-dimensional gameplay, which is very well done and serves as a good change of pace from the almost schizophrenic, mind-bending 3 dimensional stages.  Finally, with respect to gameplay, there is a more linear or straightforward map as opposed to the very open story-line that you could follow in the first game. <br />The two-player mode is more complete than in the first game, allowing the partner to attack enemies with a spin move.<br /><br />Graphics and sound:<br />The graphics are fantastic, some of the best graphics available on the Wii. The orchestration is also very well done, adding to the action but not overbearing.<br /><br />Summary:<br />All in all, an excellent game that takes all the good things about Mario Galaxy 1 and improves on them. With over 240 stars to collect and no repeat in the action, one of the biggest bargains in games.<br />

Mario Madness
There is no doubt about it that Super Mario Galaxy remains as one of the most defiant games for the Nintendo Wii. Since it came out in 2007, it has re=shaped the way Nintendo has delivered its favorite pint-sized plumber. The game really delivered in a whole new dimensiion by showcasing Mario in Zero-G with more excitement and challenges than you could definitely imagine. Now with all that hype Super Mario Galaxy 2 has finally came out and fans all over want even more of their Mario mayhem in spades, but the question is that does the sequel lose any of the formula that made Super Mario Galaxy so superb. The answer is absolutely no, it just simply adds more challenge and more mayhem to it.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy 2 is definitely one of the must-own games of 2010 that really is worth the money that is spent on. The game takes on new challenges as Mario is again sent into space trying to rescue Peach from the clutches of Bowser, accept this time the challenges are more extreme as Mario faces new worlds from a intergalatic Giant World, to tougher foes than before like Peewee Pirhana and king-sized Bullet Bills, all the way to a even more challenging Giant-sized Bowser that is even larger and fiercer than before. But Mario isn't alone in this game to face them. He has Yoshi as well in this game, and the use of Yoshi here is well worth the effort as you control him and Mario in levels that are beautiful and bolder than before. <br /><br />There are also new power-ups here too from the cloud suit, where as you jump you can make clouds become simple platforms to help you on your quest which can help you earn those extra stars, and the Rock suit that can make you Invincible as you can easily smash your way through foes and rocks to uncover hidden star bits. that'll help you earn lives as well as defeat harsher enemies. Yoshi as well has some tasty power-ups like the blimp fruit which makes hime float on air and help you get to certain platforms you couldn't do alone, the bulb fruit which helps you see certain levels that might dissapear when you're in the spooky levels of the ghouls and Boos and levels that might be spooky in the night, and the dash pepper which makes Yoshi move like a speed demon through to help you try to race your way around the extra Zero-G madness.<br /><br />The graphics are absolutely amazing through the game, and picks up nicely where the original Super Mario Galaxy has left off. The control also is strong here, with the aid of Yoshi as well, as it is easy to manuver with him as he can easily swallow Bullet Bills and Pirhana plants that'll help you on your quest, and spit them out at other goombas and lakitus that won't take no for an answer. The music though does bring back at times classic melodies from past Super Mario Brothers titles like the first Super Mario Galaxy did, but remains as epic to appease the hard core Mario fan. Nevertheless, the fun here is absolutely well-worth the effort from each and every level with new challenges and mayhem that is sure to keep your Wii plugged in for days on end.  <br /><br />All in all, if you're a owner of the Nintendo Wii and you've loved the original Super Mario Galaxy, than I absolutely recommend Super Mario Galaxy 2 as a great addition to your Wii library. It really does the job where any Mario game really should, and is a real treat for the gamer in all of us. I really love this game from the moment I've seen it and laid eyes on the madness, and trust me you'll not even be dissapointed with it either. It is well-worth the wait and Super Mario Galaxy 2 delivers from start to finish on the fun. <br /><br />Graphics: A<br /><br />Sound: A 1/2-<br /><br />Control: A<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: A<br /><br />Overall: A <br /><br />

I was skeptical, but now I believe
When I first saw the trailer for Super Mario Galaxy 2 ill admit I was dissapointed. The fact that Mario was still going to be running around in space made me believe that Nintendo got lazy and that this was really just going to be Mario Galaxy 1.5 But boy was I wrong. I just recently completed worlds 1 and 2 yesterday and here are my two cents: The creativity that went into the level design is flawless. They are just plain fun to play. And the levels arent too easy either which is a plus! I was also able to use Yoshi which is extremely fun. In one of the levels you have to eat a chili pepper and navigate Yoshi through a vertical wall with various obstacles that get in your way, its pretty challenging because Yoshi runs at a crazy speed so its easy to fall off or get hit. But that only makes getting the star at the end of the level more satisfying. I was also able to try out the new cloud and rock mario power-ups. The rock power-up is pretty powerful and very useful to mow down enemies. You'll feel unstopable. And cloud mario is neat because you can reach high places. The controls are pretty much the same so anybody who played the first game can jump right in no problem. The music is also a nice touch. It will alternate between orchestrated or remixed old school songs from some of the past Mario games. I can keep going on and on about how good this game is but doing so will not do this game justice. You HAVE TO play it! Forget what you knew about Mario Galaxy 1 and buy part 2 today. You have to play it to believe it.

The Best Wii Title to Date
In 2007, Nintendo released Super Mario Galaxy, their "spiritual" sequel to Super Mario 64. It was praised highly for it's unique level design, fantastic soundtrack, and it's genuine fun factor. 3 years later, we come to Super Mario Galaxy 2. It features great new changes to an already amazing formula, and is a blast to play.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy 2 completely forgets about what happened in SMG 1, ditching the old observatory story and starting fresh, with Mario on his way to the Star Festival. And guess who's back? Yes. Bowser. And guess what? He wants Peach. So he attacks the festival in enormous form and kidnaps Peach. Mario then meets a baby Luma, who fans will remember from the first game. He (she?) takes Mario to the sky, and he lands on a mini-hub world in the form of Starship Mario, a sort of Mario playground letting you take breaks from galaxies and have fun running around. From here, Mario meets a huge purple Luma thingie, and the game picks up.<br /><br />Like I said, the game ditches the hub world from the first game, and sticks to a traditional world map, like in side-scrolling Mario titles. This works great, and is much easier to navigate than the Comet Observatory. From here, Mario can enter galaxies. In each galaxy, there's about 3 levels, usually one from the start, one hidden one, and one level featuring a comet challenge. To get these comet challenges, one must collect the comet coins. There's one in each level, and once Mario has enough, the comet's randomly show up on the galaxies. <br /><br />Now onto the gameplay. Superb. If you thought the original SMG was good, think again. The sequel features not only 3-D levels, but a host of classic 2-D levels, reminiscing of the old Mario games. These are fantastic, and every level features intuitive level design, and each offers a new different twist. Mario's got a feast of new power-ups as well. Including Rock Mario, and with a shake of the Wiimote, curls Mario into a ball, letting him flatten and break anything he touches. Also new is Cloud Mario, my personal favorite, which lets Mario create 3 clouds which act as platforms, letting him reach new heights. Nintendo's also brought back Bee Mario, Boo Mario, and Spring Mario. Did I mention Yoshi? He's back as well, and he's got a few tricks of his own. He can swing off of flowers, and eat enemies and spit them out. He's got 3 power-ups, including a Blimp Yoshi, a Dash Pepper, and a Light Yoshi, each offering unique things to the prized gameplay. There are also new gameplay mechanics such as flying with a bird, using a drill to drill through planets, and back from the original is the big rolling ball, and these are all welcome additions.<br /><br />This game is very tough, and I found myself dying multiple times. Thankfully, the game scatters Hint TVs around levels, and you can watch them and learn hints from them. I didn't use them much at all, but for new players it's great. Also, if you die a lot in a level (and trust me, you will), Rosalina will show up and she'll show you how to get through the level, similar to the Super Guide in NSMB Wii. This is a massive game, spanning 6 worlds with about 8 galaxies in each. Once you have 120 stars, you might think you're done. But no, you must collect 120 green stars, offering a challenging way to keep you back for more.<br /><br />The controls are pretty much the same as the first game, and they work even better. In the original Galaxy, there was sometimes an awkward camera system, and this sometimes led to frustration. Thankfully, it's all been fixed in the sequel, and it never gets in the way of awesome gameplay. The graphics see a bit of an update from the original, but they're still not earth-shattering. The soundtrack is incredible, but not as good as the first game. These tunes will be stuck in your head for days, and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Galaxy 2 is incredible. The best Wii game to date. A must-have for any Wii owner, casual or hardcore.

Massively creative
This game is truly spectacular.  It uses very simple core gameplay mechanics (jump, spin, point, and groundpound) but it uses them in so many ways (including powerups, yoshi, and excellent level design) to create new gameplay mechanics to every level making them fresh and interesting.  This game is one of the best on the wii if not the best.  I love this game and it is my favorite 3-D platformer game of all time

Love it!
I really love this game. I got frustrated already on one of the bosses, but my hubby was able to beat it, so I moved on to the next level:). I really like it that it is similar to MG1, but I like this one better. The levels are awesome. I couldn't put it down the first day that I purchased it (2 days ago!). I also like the multi-player (friend) mode. I think that the new items you use are cool, too (like Cloud Mario and the driller). I also like it that you do not have to go into the room and click on a star to drag mario to that planet ( like SMG1). I hated that part about SMG1. This is much easier. I also think that the colors on this game are much better... Although, I think my TV is better this time as well, so I don't know if that has something to do with it. But I would recommend this game for sure... which is why I am!

How can you improve the original Super Mario Galaxy?  Galaxy 2 shows us how.
This is no "glorified expansion." Many thought (myself included) that Galaxy 2 would be a simple "cookie cutter" sequel to Galaxy 1.  This could not be farther from the truth.  Everything and I mean everthing has been improved.  The gameplay, graphics, music, world navigation, level-design, variety, co-op, you name it.<br /><br />Remember playing Donkey Kong Country 2 for the SNES back in 1995?  It didn't have the "wow" factor like the original Donkey Kong Country, but it was a sequel that surpassed the original in every way.  If you can remember comparing those two games, you'll have a pretty accurate parallel of what to expect between Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2.  Galaxy 2 is a top shelf title.

Yoshi. 'Nuff said.
Truly exceeded all expectations. How do you create a sequel for the best reviewed game of the generation? How do you create another Game of the Year based on the same engine, graphics and gameplay? Well you do!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Yoshi<br />More impressive integrated 2D levels (as well as the great 3D levels of course)<br />More power-ups and tricks and platformer ideas<br />Similar awesome gameplay of SMG 1 ... and just as long <br />Even better graphics, flawless framerates<br />Better boss battles<br />Even more epic music/soundtrack than the first<br /><br />Cons:<br />Less story than SMG 1 - story was one of the epic features of the first. Still all right, and it just means you want to own and play both.  SMG 2 doesn't make SMG 1 obsolete. Playing them both is a must for any serious gamer.<br />

Even fun for adults
My nine year old son loved the first Galaxy game, and in truth the entire family enjoyed watching him play it. I even took my turn playing when he'd gone to bed at night or when he was at school, and I'm definitely picky about the games that I'll play. So when Super Mario Galaxy 2 came out, we immediately went out and got it, and it's important for me to point out that this is the very first game we purchased on the day that it came out. <br /><br />The game is great! You get all of the things that you loved from the first one, including the music and the puzzles, and you get all sorts of fun new stuff, including the new power ups (I actually love the digging one) as well as Yoshi!! It's controlled the same way that the first one was controlled, and while the majority of the levels aren't too difficult (which is in keeping with the Mario world style), there are definitely some tricky puzzles that your brain has to work on a bit to figure out. <br /><br />Another thing that we found is that, when you're on spaceship Mario, you can share star bits with other players who have a profile. This is actually a really great tool, especially if you have an adult playing and a child playing a separate profile, as it allows the adult to stock up the star bits so that the child can open some of the levels of the game.<br /><br />I'm sure that we'll wear this game out just like we wore out the first one!

Wow, Yoshi, Two new suits, better navigation. You've topped the original Nintendo
Where to begin with this amazing game! I just got this game today and I must say you will be intrigued. It's the best mario game since Smash Bros. III.<br />Sure Mario has the same basic controls he had in the first one but he's still cool and works rights. Yoshi is soooo much fun to ride on. He's powerful, flawless, and fun. I didn't get to many of the suits yet except for Cloud Mario, Fire Mario, and Rainbow Mario. Fire and Rainbow are great again and Cloud is really fun and helpful. I love the new navigation system where Mario gets his own ship and you can fly to different galaxies like New Super Mario Bros. Wii if you know what I mean. It's also less frustrating and cute.<br /><br />So final verdict..................................................................................10 out of 10<br /><br /><br />This is a must buy!

Didn't think it was possible for Nintendo to surpass the original.
When I first played the original Mario Galaxy, I didn't know what the praise was about. As I got into the game, it became one of my favorite games of all time. When Galaxy 2 was announced, I was skeptical that they could surpass the original and it might become a rehash. Boy, were my fears completely wrong! Super Mario Galaxy 2 makes the original look completely outdated in terms of level design and pure creativity. In just one level, there is more creativity than in many full retail games. This game is worth every penny and more. Good job Nintendo again.

Nintendo has proven once again that they know what they are doing when it comes to games.
Over the past several years, my interest in the Wii has waned. Not since the days of Super Mario Galaxy (the first once) had I sat down and actually enjoyed a game for it. Nintendo's approach to the style of the Wii was far to casual for my taste and I lost hope in the system. I was convinced Nintendo had abandoned it's once hardcore fan-base. Not to say that Galaxy 2 has completely redeemed Nintendo of all prior missteps taken with the Wii but I must admit, this game is one of the finest pieces of gaming genius. Good job with this one Nintendo.

I'll keep it short... :)
Mario Galaxy is back and better than ever! The bar has been officially raised again for the platforming genre and modern gaming in general. Miyamoto has outdone himself with this one guys. Everything is superb and plays like a dream. I won't spoil a thing. I can see myself playing this for over 100 hours and for years to come. Nintendo's new masterpiece is Super Mario Galaxy 2!

Nintendo Does It Again!
I was fortunate enough to play this game Friday. Living in the NYC area and being a Club Nintendo Member with platinum status, I was invited to the Nintendo World Store at Rockefeller Center for a private 3 hour pre-launch party for Super Mario Galaxy 2. This game is not only a home run, it's a grand slam. I've been playing with Mario since I was a teenager. This game is pure eye candy. Make no mistake, it is difficult when you clear the first few stages. They have improved on the original for sure!

MARIO HAS DONE IT...AGAIN
I've only played this game for a few hours and already I'm in love with it.  I played Mario Galaxy and that was a  great game despite the fact that Yoshi wasn't in it, I thought they made a mistake at first but after playing MG I felt who need him.  Until I played Mario Galaxy 2 Yoshi is back and better than ever  with  new colors and  new abilities, depending on what he eats. Yoshi get bloated and  blows air so you can fly for a short period of time when eating a blimp berry, he turns orange and runs faster after eating a dash pepper, he turns a hot yellow and  brighten hidden paths after eating a glimmer bulb berry it's just so awesome how they made him.  Now for the star of this game Mario himself  he returns with most of his previous MG abilities with of course some new ones as well such as Rock Mario, yes rock his hat and overall turns to stone giving him the power to turn into a boulder and roll and jump around to destroy enemies.  Another new power is Cloud Mario, he clothes become puffy looking resembling fire Mario but now he can create clouds to ride on as well he can now walk other clouds he would fall through this power up is very limited as you will see.  So as you just read Mario has once again came back and is better than ever, with a new challenging yet fun to play game.  This is a must-have for any Wii owner.  Now for my critical review GRAPHICS 5stars looks great, GAMEPLAY 5stars very fun to play,  STORYLINE 5stars great tie-ins, NEW FEATURES 5stars yoshi's back and new abilities and SUPER MARIO GALAXY 2 5stars. <br />

Super Mario Galaxy 2
So far so good.  I completely beat the first SMG with both mario and luigi and am super stoked to beat this one.  I am very happy with the game play it is even better with the addition of Yoshi and new power ups.  I can't wait to get deeper in the game.  I would definately recommend either of the super mario galaxy games.

Yes! The Yoshis Back!
After playing Mario Galaxy I knew that this sequel would be just as entertaining and fun to play as the previous game and I wasn't mistaken.  The intro story is a expected mostly similar to the first games intro with some differences of course but the story is about the same for both, rescue the princess help your new friends, defeat Bowser and his mini-bosses, and return the galaxy to the right way.  The one thing other than the incredible animation and effects that fit the game perfectly was the reintroduction of my favorite lizard Yoshi who I have a great fondness for,  I felt that after being part of the Mario game universe for so long that a Mario game wouldn't be the same without him as the said can be said with Mario's mushroom friends his brother Luigi and of course his true love Princess Peach.  The game controls are the same as with the first Mario Galaxy game for the most part and I appreciate that since it's sometimes of a headache when you play one game and the sequel to it comes out with almost totally different control actions, also the addiction to the game is the mini-bosses you have to fight along the way and the different ways you have to defeat them.  So rejoice fans of the Mario gaming world another great game has come out for us to enjoy once again...

Best Game On The Wii
This is by far the best game ever created for the Wii. It is challenging, engaging, beautiful, and a lot of fun. <br /><br />I have not seen better graphics on the Wii. It is even better than the first game. The design of the graphics is the same but more polished and detailed. <br /><br />The levels are challenging but not SO difficult that it takes 10 hours to do one level. It is just right. There are also many hidden adventures that lend themselves to a more challenging experience. Also, love all the new power ups that Mario gets to use. (Rock, Drill, Cloud, etc.)<br /><br />Yoshi is back!! Yoshi brings a lot of fun to the game. Yoshi also gets some interesting power ups (Balloon, hot pepper, etc)<br /><br />The music is fantastic. I enjoy it much better than the first game.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a pretty much a perfect game.

How can it be so full of win?
I loved the first SMG but this game is head and shoulders above it.  Its not really a sequel to the first, on one had it begins in almost the same fashion, but without the adorableness of the original "lost luma" story or the (much hotter than peach) galaxy princess, who i think they removed because Peach couldn't handle the competition.  But in general the begining is much more the point because SMG2 knows what its all about and doesn't waste any time getting out there, everything has been slimmed down to increase the awesmness ratio.  As much as I loved all the little rooms and silly luma in the original, the first time through, after you'd been there once it got old, the new game cut the fat down to the core of Mario game-play joy and multiplied it by 1o fold.  <br /><br />I can't say enough about this game which truly excels at what it is.  to make the point, just consider how much it fails at what would be requisit for any game: sotry? laughable, although I suppose that laughable in its most literal sense isn't a true fault.  Role-playing?  Well a several points the character can choice between responses of: "that's right" and "yes".  But in this game thats all part of the fun because its like a theme park ride from beginning to end, and no one asks you then where your gonna go, but you know you'll love the ride.  <br /><br />Chances are if your interested you know you like Mario games but maybe money's tight enough that of the bajillion out there, half-a-bajillion are great and which to buy?  Buy this one!  If you don't own the first and can't make time in your life for both, get this one, even though the first is great, this is greater.  Don't own New Super Mario Bros Wii yet?  Get this instead.  I guess what I'm trying to say is its special when a game can do what its always done so well, and do it better then you imagined it could, not since SM64 have I had this much fun with The Italian Plumber.<br /><br />Side note the game looks fantastic, even in SD, and Yoshi is so much fun you'll literally feel guilty about it, the tounge thing works perfectly on the Wii how did this no occur to them before? <br /><br />All in all SMG is to 3D Super Mario's what Super Mario Bros 3 was to the 2D iterations<br /><br />

A WHOLE NEW GALAXY OF FUN!
I have only recently returned to consoles, tempted by my wife's Wii this Christmas. In the past NINTENDO has made a number of bad decisions yet the company always manages to land on its feet for nothing else but for a single reason: it never forgets that gamers want first to have fun. And SUPER MARIO GALAXY II is an excellent example.<br /><br />The Wii console may have been made such a huge success story by applications such as Wii-FIT, but it will be remembered for the fun it offers with games such as this one. SUPER MARIO GALAXY II makes the Wii shine at its best.<br /><br />Princess Peach cannot seem to stay ...un-kidnapped more than a week, so her faithful plumber has to move heaven and earth to save her - yet again...But do we really need an excuse to dive in this galaxy of magic mushrooms, star-bits and coins, secret levels and surprising solutions to, apparently, insurmountable obstacles?<br /><br />The levels blend beautifully 2D and 3D environments and the controls work superbly. I hadn't touched a console since my University years and had to get used to the controls of ZELDA: TWILIGHT PRINCESS - yet found the controls of SUPER MARIO GALAXY II to fit like a glove from the very first moment.<br /><br />This installment is not one you can breeze through, there are challenging moments. If you get stuck in a level you can ask for a mini-tutorial - but keep in mind that there is no free lunch in this galaxy: your need for assistance will be marked. Then again, retrying a level was never more fun.<br /><br />There is invincible Rainbow-Mario, Rock-Mario, Spring-Mario and Cloud-Mario. And then there are Lumas and Yoshi. Every world has been imaginatively designed and gorgeously drawn. It is like a supernova of creativity exploding again and again. I believe this to be the best looking game on the Wii.<br /><br />And it is THE BEST PLATFORM GAME EVER!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Wildly Amazing
In many ways, Mario really hasn't changed much from the time of scurrying through level 1-1 in 1985.  You still run as fast as you can to the end of the stage, stomp on enemies, hit powerup blocks and the like.  But of course why change what isn't broken.  Like the original SMG, SMG2 is a spiritual successor to Super Mario 64.  Once again, Nintendo uses their flagship mascot to put out a genre defining game.<br /><br />It could be argued to give SMG2 a lower score than the original merely because it isn't the giant leap forward the original was. I find this misguided.  Mario has always been about pinpoint control and perfect level design, two things shown here in spades.  There is not a single boring level and there is always something new to do.  Be it reaching new comet coins, solving puzzles or any of the other platforming activities. <br /><br />The game is difficult.  Not to breeze through and finish, but to find every star and comet coin.  This allows a gamer to feel accomplished after breezing through a selection of levels while finding enough to do for the hardcore gamer.  Its the perfect mix.<br /><br />No, it isn't HD graphics, but the art design is beautiful.  Simply put, some gamers have abandoned Nintendo because they feel they have outgrown Mario and the cartoonish ways.  However, they are missing out because Mario is still consistantly the best games available.  Amazing game.

Super Mario Galaxy 2 rules
IT is a great game. If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ9QVI">Super Mario Galaxy</a> you will love this game even more. There are tons of new additions like yoshis. Yoshis are awesome. They can run fast, glow, float,and you can aim their tongue by using the wii remote. Their is also rock mario. As rock mario if you shake the wii remote you start rolling. Their is also cloud mario. When you shake the wii remote you create a cloud which you can land on. You only have three clouds per cloud mushroom so if you make three clouds you will have to return to where you first found the cloud mushroom.

Absolutely Astonishing
Super Mario Galaxy 2 takes gaming to a whole new level. You experience all the fun of its previous version, but better. The levels are different, and the challenges are harder. It is great for a hard-core gamer, and a beginner. I was astonished by the great graphics and amazing fun.  This game is the best Wii game by ALOT, and I mean it. Games do not get better than this.  This games is a MUST HAVE for ALL Wii owners. The top game review sites (IGN, Gamespot, 1UP) give it a 10. Super Mario Galaxy was great, this, is better. I would not hesitate, buy this now.<br /><br />Sounds- 10/10<br />Graphics-10/10<br />Controls-10/10<br />Fun-10/10<br />OVERALL-10/10

Simply The Best
The all new slimmer PSP 3000 comes in with a couple of new upgrades over the 2000 model. Primarily for the Skype functionality, a microphone is onboard along with a reduced glare 4.3" screen. Its a given that fingerprints will still be a continued issue for the PSP line. Thankfully, the age old problem of ghosting has yet to appear on my new PSP 3000. <br /><br />One of the sweeter features now is an upgraded (AV) video output support. Owners can now operate their systems with regular (NON HD) TV. I suggest buyers pick up a good composite or component cable. With the usual collection of great games, improved graphics is a major plus.<br /><br />As with all previous models, control buttons layout are very much like the classic Play Station. One area of concern is that load times for the UMD (Universal Media Disc) seemed to drag a bit. Its a given that purchasing the kit which includes the proprietary MS Duo Card is more cost effective in the end. Its obvious that Sony missed the boat when it went with its own proprietary format instead of the more widely used and less costly SD standard.<br /><br />Even though Wi-fi capable, the unit is outfitted with possibly the slowest version (802.11b) on the planet. It powers up via a 5 volt ac adapter or USB. Video playback is great as long as you copy your favorites on the memory stick Duo Card. Going any other way is definitely a slow dragged out process. When it comes to television, Sony's own version of Slingbox allows for free tv viewing. <br /><br />This PSP won't get confused with your IPOD anytime soon but music play is generally good. Another added feature is that it will even support music art. If one is going to display photos on the PSP I strongly suggest compressing your files. Photo display can be via slide show or singles.<br /><br />Of note, the PSP is also a web browser. However, its hit and miss for flash. Streaming internet radio via Shoutcast is a freebie. PSP offers a regular schedule of firmware updates. As with the earlier editions, via a network or the internet the unit can pick up audio, video and photo files that are stored on a PS3. The PSP 3000 comes with the standard 1200 mAh rechargeable battery. Battery life runs almost a full 5 hours whether one is gaming or watching a movie.<br /><br />Necessary accessories such as the Memory Stick Duo card, protective screen cover, headphones and a carrying case are not included. Not all PSP headphones are compatible with the PSP 3000. When purchasing headphones read the specs carefully. <br /><br />Even without the included accessories, the PSP 3000 still brings it on. I would definitely recommend this model as a gift or as a personal purchase. After all, it is Play Station.

Handheld entertainment bonanza
With a wealth of games and movies, the new refined PSP is a big bonanza. It is slim, sleek and bright. Either if you are new to PSP or upgrading from PSP1000, this one has a lot to offer. Inbuilt microphone, bright LCD scree, better battery life, smoother inputs and more ergonomic placement of master controls. This is a very well designed machine, if you have checked the past PSP history they have very long life. Perfect for both adults and young ones. 08 had more than 10 block busters for PSP. 09 is promising to be another great one with more goods coming from Japan and EU. Most important of all Little Big planet and Resistance Retribution. All the PSP2000 accessories are compatible with PSP3000, every thing from case to car chargers. As with PSP2000 this one sport a larger RAM. With additional hardware resources it supports a wide variety of media including 720x480p H.264/MP4 DVD quality movies, wma, mp3 and more. <br /><br />Now one important warning. Memory Stick Duo is one of the most pirated card in black market. Pay up and buy from trusted vendors. Cheap cards sold in ebay and other 3rd party vendors are slow and less reliable. When you put the card in any device like PSP check for magic-gate info. If it says magic-gate: unknown, return it back. You are better off buying Lexar or other cheaper card from reputable vendor than buying fake card. Dont promote fake sellers, if you find any fake seller report to Amazon and authorities. <br /><br />http://reviews.ebay.com/FAKE-Sony-Memory-Stick-Pro-Duo-MagicGate-Cards-Exposed_W0QQugidZ10000000001236041<br /><br />

It comes close to portable gaming perfection
We've been a PS3 household ever since the 60GB version came about so, with two pre-teens in the house, we were ripe for a PSP adoption. We actually bought the Ratchet & Clank Pack for a few dollars more because one of my kids was a fan of the game.<br /><br />The Core Pack includes the following:<br /><br />- The PSP 3000 itself in shiny black (a fingerprint magnet)<br />- Manual, promos, registration card, etc.<br /><br />Given the PSP's built-in Wi-Fi and its PS3 integration you can do quite a few things out of the box if you have Wi-Fi or a PS3 but, for a better gaming experience you are going to need a memory stick and, of course, some games. Our bundle came with a 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo card but we are planning to store a few movies when taking it on the road so we ordered an 8GB. Movies take about 0.5GB. We can still use the 1GB that came with the bundle in a camera.<br /><br />First impressions:<br />I was surprised of how good and versatile and elegant this little console can be. It has most of the PS3 buttons, including one analog joystick, the display is large and bright, the resolution is good (480x272), and it responds quickly to controls. It appears to be solidly built. Unlike prior models, this one comes with a built-in microphone while the sound output can be either through the internal speakers headphones (not included). After charging the battery, my kid was up and running and happy in no time. But, let me proceed with a more structured discussion.<br /><br />Stand alone operation (disconnected):<br />The PSP 3000 will play games or movies delivered on UMD discs or off a Memory Stick card. In addition, it will display photos and play music stored on the Memory card.<br /><br />Networking and Internet connectivity:<br />The built-in Wi-Fi allows the PSP 3000 to access the Playstation Netowork and Playstation Store directly. Off the box, there is an Internet browser, a Search (the Internet) function, several Internet Radio applications and the ability to use the PSP as a Skype phone for as long as one has a Skype account and the PSP happens to be within the range of a Wi-Fi hotspot.<br /><br />PS3 Integration:<br />After the PSP is paired with the PS3, the PS3 can 'push' video, photos, music and even PSP games downloaded from the Playstation Store when connected through a USB wire. When wireless, the PSP can basically take over the PS3 - actually display the PS3's own screen and display photos stored on the PS3, play music stored on the PS3. Movie play is not supported. <br />Interestingly, when playing music, it's possible to play it on the PSP's on speakers/headphones or have the PS3 play it itself, the PSP therefore acting as a remote control device.<br />I suspect that additional capabilities exist that I am not aware of yet.<br /><br />PC integration:<br />Through a USB connection, the PC will see the PSP's memory card as an attached drive. This will allow for music, photo or movie files to be transferred directly to the PSP.<br /><br />Room for improvement:<br />The PSP 3000 comes very close to being the perfect portable game-playing (and more) machine, at least in the Sony universe. Perfection would be achieved if the 'keyboard' interface were improved - it's awful now - if it had touch screen capabilities and if file transfers from the PS3 were possible wirelessly. Also on the wish list, I hope that there were more legal 'digital copy' movies available for the PSP.<br /><br />Rating:<br />It's a 4.5 stars plus, rounded up to 5.

best portable gaming system
This PSP is my 2nd one after my first generation PSP broke down. And that was after countless business trips and travel for about 2.5 years and our 16 month old grabbing it and "playing" with it from time to time.  The new PSP 3000 is much lighter and the screen is noticeably better than the previous model.  The internet interface is also pretty good but for a gaming system IMO I don't think you get much better.  Also - I bought a larger memory stick (8GB) to store movies and video and it is really nice when I'm on the plane.  If you have video in itunes you can easily just copy and paste them into the PSP folder like you would move any file within your computer or to an external drive.  I use this for gaming nearly 95% of the time and I wouldn't get anything else.  Definitely worth the money and the best portable gaming device that I have used bar none.  Highly recommended.

This is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok first of all let me start by saying the psp 3000 is awsome.<br /><br /> The core pack is nice put it only comes in black. In the box you will find the PSP 3000 (black), the batery, the ac adapter and the charger thats it. where as the bundle packs come with the PSP 3000 (black or silver), a memory stick, a game, a movie, a voucher, the ac adapter and the charger.<br /><br /> The core pack is cheaper than the others. The black is glossy where as the silver is matte.<br /><br /> The new features of the PSP 3000 is that the LCD screen is enhanced making it glare proof and there is a built in microphone for scype.<br /><br /> Thats it for my review hope it helped.

New and shiny
PlayStation 3000. This is a nice machine, piano black and glossy. I just love that look. I also own a 1000. The new one has much faster load times and I have noticed much brighter colors and the screen is defiantly glare proof. Words cannot describe what you can get out of any of these products along with a PS3, but I will try. If you have a home network these systems can connect directly to your wireless router and your ps3. This might be techie or geeky but you can even play certain ps3 games on your Psp via remote play option, you can download and play ps1 games on the psp anywhere you want to. Get an 8 or 4 gig card for this thing and transfer anything from your PC to it, surf the internet, listen to music. The 2000 and the 3000 model can be hooked to a big screen, the list goes on. <br /><br />Back to the 3000 itself. Faster load times, glare proof and much lighter, with big screen compatibility. I was worried about the scan line issue I read about in other reviews but not now it is very miner and with with future updates I suspect it will completely disappear.

PSP Is Fantastic
The PSP is a great little device capable of not only playing games, but also managing photos, videos, music, as well as allowing the user to browse the internet.  With its unique media format, known as the Universal Media Disc (UMD), the PSP brings innovation to the handheld world dominated by cartridges.  The PSP allows for great user customization, such as custom wallpapers, icons, etc.  The PSP has built in WiFi and can be utilized to gain full access to the built in web browser or to the PlayStation Store to download extras.  <br /><br />The added benefit of the PSP-3000 over the PSP Go is the ability to own physical copies of the games/media purchased.  In case the console ever becomes damaged, it would be a much simpler, and quicker task to simply purchase another 3000 that can read your UMDs immediately upon purchase, as compared to the challenges one may face when switching over from one PSP Go to another.  The smaller price-tag of the PSP-3000 makes it an even more optimal choice over the Go.  The PSP has access to tons of great UMD games, many of which have not been added to the PlayStation store yet, making this yet another pro for the PSP over the Go.  Many users also like the added benefit of owning physical copies of media because it allows them to feel like they actually own the media rather than simply feel like they are renting it from the developers.  Licensing issues in the past have made Microsoft pull off a few games from Xbox Arcade after only a short amount of time after their initial release.  Situations such as this can cause high levels of paranoia amongst the owners of the media since they do not know whether or not the developers can remove the media just as quickly as they offered it.  <br /><br />The PSP is very comfortable, fitting the forms of the hands quite nicely.  By using the familiar layout associated with other Sony consoles (square, triangle, etc.) the controls are very easy to adjust to and make playing games such as God of War Chains of Olympus an easy transition from their console counterparts.  The major complaint I have with the console is the small analog "stick" that protrudes from the bottom left corner of the console.  The stick is rather small and does not have a great range of motion, this makes it difficult to maneuver properly in games that use the stick.  The lack of a second stick also makes mapping of buttons quite awkward in certain games as well, especially when compared to console versions of the same game.  This takes some time to get used to and is simply a minor nuisance when weighed against all of the benefits of the console.  I highly recommend the PSP-3000 over the PSP Go to anyone who's ever been curious about the capabilities of the PSP consoles.

PSP 3000 - Excellent upgrade
Hello,<br /><br />I just upgraded from a PSP2000 model, decided not to wait for the PSP-GO as I don't like to be too much on the bleeding edge of new tech devices. <br /><br />Let me first say the screen on this model is far superior to the previous models in every way. Richer colors, and a brighter display, make gaming on the go much easier on the eyes!<br /><br />The built in mic is a nice touch for online gaming and Skype. Also the device has been more streamlined. The edges,corners, etc. are more rounded now. Feels a little better when holding it for long periods of time.<br /><br />For those new to PSP - Besides gaming, you can do a LOT of stuff with this device. On the Playstation store you can download games, movies, TV shows, and more. And now that iTunes is DRM free you can easily put your music on the PSP as well. Drag and drop or download Sony's Media GO (PC ONLY). For Mac users get PSP-Ware or Missing Sync. These work well and are not expensive. <br /><br />If you don't have a PSP, get it. And if you are considering upgrading from the previous models, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />

Awesome Little Device - Well worth the $$$
I was ready for the worst after reading several PSP 3000 reviews here and elsewhere. However, in my opinion...<br /><br />...this is an awesome little unit for listening to music, watching videos, looking at photos, playing games, and browsing the web.  My wife owns an iPod Touch and the PSP 3000 puts that device to shame.  The PSP 3000 is much more user-friendly, easier to load up with photos, mucic, and videos than the iPod Touch, and the user interface and file conversion is much better.  I'm not sure what all the positive buzz is about on the iPod but for my money and time the PSP 3000 is hands-down easier to operate and maintain (especially the file sharing and uploading functionality).<br /><br />Best of all, there's no quirky i-Tunes store to have to mess with, just convert and transfer the files like with any hard drive or flash drive...it's just that simple!  Plus the PSP 3000 user interface just looks and works better than the iPod Touch.<br /><br />I used to own a Sony Milo and the problem with that unit was the wireless connection utility was worthless unless you were practically standing on top of a wireless access point.  Not so with the PSP 3K -- it picks up lots of wireless signals all over town and you usually have several to pick from...conects in under 30-seconds - and this makes Skype a real alternative to an expensive cell phone if you live in a metropolitan area.  I Skype out most anytime I want to now, no matter where I am, using the PSP 3000.<br /><br />The included internet browser is very nice and supports flash and a lot of other plug-ins you need to view sites fully.  This isn't a watered-down internet you will get...you see the real deal on most sites with reasonable fast loading of pages.<br /><br />As far as playing games, the PSP is off the charts.  There are just so many games to choose from and they all work great.  You can have a UMD disk in the unit and still do everyting else on the PSP without having to take it out...just hit the PSP button and choose exit game and you're ready to go.<br /><br />Music plays without a hitch with several fun visualizations to choose from.  The music menu allows for shuffle, replay, etc...there are tons more options here than with an iPod.<br /><br />Photos & Videos load and play without error with tons of display options and never a problem.<br /><br />All files convert easily using the included software no matter what format they started as.  The software that comes with your PSP 3000 will convert any music, photo, and video file into a PSP-friendly format and there's nothing cooler than watching a brand new movie on the plane and having the guy next to you in first class stare in awe when he sees you're watching the movie he just paid $15 to see in a theater right on your PSP.<br /><br />Did I mention the fabulous PSP store is just one click away on your PSP main menu? At the store, you'll find thousands of music, games, movies and TV shows available with fast digital download directly to your PSP through your wireless connection.  You could be watching a first-run movie two minutes from now, wherever you are.  Now that's cool.<br /><br />If you want a cutting-edge, do it all device at a reasonable price that works without a fuss? Buy the PSP 3000!

Scan lines create NO problem---for me at least
This is amazing. So much better than the 2000. It has gotten some small cosmetic changes (like having curvier edges, oval PS, START, & SELECT buttons, and different logos), which makes it look much better than any other PSP out there. Seriously, if you want a PSP, get this one. Scan lines are hardly noticeable.

FUN
Great buy! Portable and Lightweight with a huge selection of games. You can put movies,music and photos on it and have them with you on the go. This is my first psp, so i dont know how the other versions are, but the 3000 by far exceeds my expectations. Just 1 complaint which is small but sometimes when your playing certain games you accidently press on the hold switch and it shuts off, but u can turn it right back on where you were at in the game. Pretty fast shipping considering it was shipped to an APO. A+++++++++

A great device
I just bought the Rock Star bundle and the PSP 3000 is awesome. The games play fast and bright and loud threw speakers and headphones. These games play better than my laptop does with a Core 2 duo 8600, 4gb RAM, & 512mb graphics card on battery (on battery its better). Also the web browser is a little awkward but is functional to read and respond on Yahoo mail. Plus you can read all the Yahoo news. The three reasons I bought it. Also you can adjust the web screen to fit in the screen when reading articles, web pages, etc. I can't notice at all any of the "scanlines" Ive read about when I play games. For the price and the GTA games plus tons of other great games, movies, music, internet access, this toy just rocks as a portable device for trips and everyday use. Im a web designer and I wouldnt show this to my clients but using it to respond to their constant emails will help extremely and when Im done I can get back to the street robbing punks and bustin hos on GTA!

Very nice PSP
If you are unsure about whether to get a PSP Go or a PSP 3000, some things to consider:<br /><br />PSP 3000:<br />  UMD Drive<br />  Downloadable Content<br />  Larger Screen<br />  Heavier<br />  Less Battery Life<br /><br />PSP Go:<br />  NO UMD DRIVE<br />  Downloadable Content<br />  Smaller Screen<br />  Lighter<br />  More Battery Life<br /><br />Which one you choose, its up to preference. I personally like discs better than files. You can run out of space.. Problems with Sony might end up to losing purchases.. But that's just me. I own both.

Awesome!!
I love this one soooo much!! I am a huge PSP fan. I once had both a psp-1000 and 2000. I decided to upgrade to the 3000 and it is great! I would recommend this for everyone! It has a few bad things such as the internet not always connecting, but maybe that is just mine. The battery works greta! better than old ones. If you charge it out of the box, you will be able to play 7-8-hrs.

Best Handheld Ever!
This is definetly the best handheld system. It has amazing graphics. It is like a PS2 in your hands. The joystick is and buttons are very strong. It also has a built in microphone so you use Skype to call people anywhere in the world with and internet connection. Also the internet is pretty fast for a handheld. You can also put music, video, pictures, and download games from the playstation network.  And since you need an internet connection to use Skype and download games from the playstation network you can use a wireless hotspot also and since those are everywhere now it will be very easy to find them. Overall the PSP is a great handheld system and I highly recommend getting one for yourself.

The best portable gaming system out there!
After the recent fail i heard about the PSP Go (cuz i was interested in what it was) it's extremely dissapointing. If your looking for a portable gaming system this is it right here. If you want a much bigger libary & a more selection of games this is what you should buy, avoid the PSP Go unless you already know there are games on that system you would like. The PSP go isn't really a PSP. Sure it has the same functions as this but you lose the ability to play UMD games that are still easily available. Even if Sony manages to put every single PSP game, this is still cheaper. I only say this because not everyone is ready for the digital world & since the PSP GO is entirely digital it lacks a certain ability that many game consoles have. It only takes less then a $1 to make a physical copy of the game & while downloadable games are nice to have so you don't have to swap out disks it isn't perfect yet.<br /><br />This is why i suggest this system instead of the PSP Go.<br /><br />And while this does have some cons, like the UMD hatch seems kinda flimsy so your little brother might tear it off causing a major issue being able to play games you can still download games the same as you can with the PSP Go. Another con is the memory sticks are not cheap, compared to hard drives.. hard drives are much cheaper by the GB then it is buying a memory stick. Sure you can go 'off brand' but how much more reliable are they compared to Sony's brand? I have never tried it but it's like they say you get what you pay for. Doesn't always work that way though. This model of PSP is cheaper then the PSP GO & you won't lose your warrenty if you need to replace the battery or if you choose to have extras. The other con i have is the charging cord is on the bottom & its easy to pull on it making the plug-in a little loose. I suggest not playing it while charging it & unhook it when the charge is complete. There might be a charging dock for the batteries themselves & you could just have 2 batteries, 1 in the psp while the other charging. Another is having 2 psps but highly unlikely if you don't have the money. But after seeing the PSP Go, you might want to buy a backup PSP 3000.<br /><br />What seperates this from the Nintendo DS? Much cooler graphics & a bigger screen. And you can watch movies. You can even download them.

A gamer's portable
First of all expect to spend much more than $169 before you can enjoy the PSP. Once you add a memory card, a couple of games, a case and a skin or screen protector, you would've spent over $200.00 before you even take the system home. However, the PSP experience is still incredible almost 5 years after it came out. Far more powerful and technologically superior to the DS and capable of providing deep, detailed gameplay compared to the iPhone's short attention span offerings, the PSP is a true gamer's console with the following great features:<br /><br />-Great library of games covering RPGs, action, sports, etc etc. They retail for about $30 to $40 but eBay always has tons of used or NOS games for less than $20 every day. <br />-Capable of playing Nintendo, Super Nintendo, N64, PS1, Sega Master, Sega Genesis and other games from older systems via freely available emulators<br />-Capable of wirelessly controlling a PS3 and using media on the bigger machine.<br />-Capable of browsing the internet and download games, demos, themes and other media via WiFi. The demos help in game buying decisions while the themes allow the user to personalize their PSP<br /><br />All in all the PSP may be old but nothing in the market can touch its gaming horsepower. If you like your on the go games to be just as detailed and complex as your home console games then you owe yourself a PSP.

Great Portable Console!
The PSP is the first portable console released by Sony; it was first released in Japan late 2004 then in America in March of 2005 and the first upgrade the 2000 was launched in 2007. The PSP 3000 came out in 2008 and is the third and latest version of the PSP. I think that by now you should know what to expect, after all it's the same PSP with a few changes. This one is even lighter and brighter than the original and the 2000, it has an improved LCD screen (I wouldn't worry too much about the scan lines). It now has a microphone (which I've never used as of now), a longer battery life it also feels great in my hands which is great. It comes in different colors; piano black, silver, purple and white (there are also limited edition ones as well and some with designs on them). There are also many packages to choose from, maybe you just want the core to replace your current PSP or you may want to buy the Ratchet and Clank package or perhaps the Assassin's Creed one.<br /><br />So is it worth buying a PSP 3000 right now? Yes. There are some goods games available like Final Fantasy Crisis Core, God of War and there are still good games coming out for the system. The games don't cost that much either they are priced reasonably, you can buy a brand new one for about 40$ and "Greatest Hits" games are under 20$. It does a lot of things for a portable console, including networking. You may want to consider buying a bigger memory stick card if you plan on playing many games and having many files on your PSP. Don't worry about the PSP Go, I know there are some concerns but it's a different console and Sony aren't planning to replace the PSP with it, it's entirely different and if you aren't comfortable with the fact that you don't have physical copies of the game (you buy games online) you should rather get this one or an older version of the PSP.<br />

Simply Put, its not meant for everyone
Ah the PSP Go, in recent hardware history I can't beginning to think of another release that has created as much fighting within video game communities. Maybe the PS3, but even that didn't seem to have to have as much backlash, since it was a good deal for all you were getting. So is the PSP Go a raw deal? Or is this an example of a loud vocal minority raining on a products parade? Find out below.<br /> <br />Design<br /> <br />When I original purchased a PSP 1000 in 2006, I did so because I was looking to get an MP3 player, and I felt if I was going to spend a couple hundred, maybe it would be smart to look into getting one that did other things including play game. Well guess what? Its 2009 now and two PSPs later (1000 then a 2000), I own an iPOD. Why? Because while I love the gaming on the PSP, the 1000 and even the 2000 models were much too large to effective be an MP3 player. I mean you can really jog well with the old PSP. Then from a portable media perspective, because the system was reliant on the Memory Stick Pro Duo, It couldn't effective store as much music as I would like.<br /> <br />Now this brings us to the PSPGo, which in terms of design is a dream, especially if you experienced the same issues as I did. The size of the unit has been decreased substantially to now when closed its slight longer than a deck of cards, or just a little bit larger than an iPHONE or iPOD Touch. Sony decided to incorporate a sliding screen that hides the gaming controls, similar there own Mylo device or a lot of high end Pocket PC Smartphones. The unit feels great in your hand, and is so much easier to carry around. A lot of people have complained in the past about how they don't carry their PSP because they have to "think" about it. That is no longer an issues with the Go, for the most part I find myself carrying it, without even thinking about it. The best thing I can tell you about the size is this, with my Go in one pocket, and my smartphone in the other, I could not tell which was which, and grabbed my Go to make a call. That is something that would NEVER happen with the old PSPs, unless you had a Zack Morris Saved By the Bell Phone. <br /> <br />There are some negatives for this size reduction that might be a deal breaker depending on who you are. First the screen has decreased from 4.3 to 3.8. Now while this decrease ends up only being 1cm or so, some people take issue with it. For the most part, while you can tell the screen is smaller if you're familiar with the past PSPs, it's not much of a different. It's almost like comparing a 40" HDTV to a 37". Sure the owners of the 40" can tell the difference but it's not a huge difference.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the screen is the best PSP screen to date. Basically it has the brightness and color levels of the 3000 without the interlacing, and without the ghosting of the 2000.<br /> <br />Next the buttons on the unit. The buttons are actually a slight bit smaller and have a  new layout that parallels Sony's own Dual Shock 3 Controller with the D-Pad and analog stick placement. If you're used to using the normal PSP, this new button layout may take some getting used to, but once you do it feels just as natural if not better. <br /><br />The only issues some might have with the buttons are the following: The D-Pad now sits lower, so if you're a fighting game fan, while its better than the PSP 1000 was, its not as good as the 2000/3000 models. Next is the placement of the L and R buttons. To me, the felt at little weird at first, and they don't seem to fit your hand placement as naturally as the old PSP, but for the most part they work well and I no longer have problems. For those with larger hands, do not worry. You shouldn't have any problem with the Go, I had more hand cramps on my normal PSP then I have had in my play sessions with the Go.<br /><br />The Go now uses a propitiatory multifunction port and Sony's new M2 memory stick. This means that your old accessories will not work. Nothing new in the world of technology, but that the same time that doesn't make it any less annoying. The new port handhelds everything from USB syncing to AV output, the handheld includes one cable, but you'll probably want to buy another.<br /> <br />Games and multimedia<br /><br />Getting Games onto the Go is a love hate relation ship for some. There are three ways to buy games, that all take you back to the same place. <br /><br />1.Search for games on PSN and download the ones you want.<br />2.Buy a download card for the game you want at retail (if available) and download it from PSN when you get home.<br />3.Buy a download code from Amazon to download the game from PSN<br /><br />All three methods are depended on PSN, this is a gift and curse for some and should weigh heavily in your decision to buy a Go or Not. Not every PSP game is on PSN, and not every PSP game will EVER be on PSN. Going forward Sony has announced that first party releases (Socom, LittleBigPlanet, Jak and Daxter, etc..) will have have same day digital releases as retail. While third party games maybe released on the same day, a few days later during the weekly store update, or even months later. It all depends on the company. So if you're the type that only games on the PSP so constantly needs a new game, or has to go to midnight launches for every game the Go might not be fore you. There are already complaints because DISSIDIA Final Fantasy arguably one of the best PSP games period is not on the store yet (its coming) or the fact that last Store Update(10/8/09) only had two of the three basketball games released that week, with no Star wars, Naurto, or even Legacy UMD Games. Every new game should at some point make it to PSN and most of the top old games. But if there is a game you can't live without playing and its not there, or is not released on the same day, the Go is probably not for you. <br /><br />Also the pricing of games on PSN is a factor. The games can be the same as retail, less than retail, or more expensive than retail. And when I say retail, I'm talking about Manufacture Suggested Retail Price MSRP. So if you're like me when it comings to shopping, you know that will enough internet searching you can find almost anything cheaper. Then also with the cheaper factor you can't buy used games. For some this won't be a big deal, because they don't buy used or trade games anyway, but if you're one of those people, don't buy the Go.<br /><br />Once you decide to purchase a game from PSN, you can download the game directly on the Go itself. Download the game via Media Go  from your PC and transfer it to your PSP, or Download the game on your PS3 and transfer it to your PSP. I recommend the last two options, because downloading from the Go itself is very slow, and since there is no kind of background downloading you can't do anything else with the system. The only time I would ever download directly to the Go is if your downloading a game that is under 50MBs, or you're way from your main set up and have no other choice. Also if you're download is interrupted, you can't start where you left off, you have to start all over.<br /><br />The Go has built in Wifi and Bluetooth for all your networking needs. With Wifi you can connect to the internet for gaming, or just simple web browsing. You can also connect to a PS3 for remote play, which will allow you to control and game on your PS3 via the PSP. Bluetooth is a welcome addition and one of the main reason I was excited about the Go. With Bluetooth you can connect to a headset for gaming or Skype calls, you can connect to a PS3 controller for gaming, and you can tether to a cellphone for downloading and surfing when Wifi isn't available. Connecting to a PS3 controller is a lot cooler than I thought it would be, when in use it even unlocks the multiplayer features of PS1 games. So you can easily connect your Go to the TV, then connect your controller for a console like experience.<br /><br />For multimedia the Go's 16GBs of one board flash memory plus the option for additional expansion through the M2 make it a beast. Currently on my Go I have 28 Games (20 PSP, 2 Minis, 6 PS1), 18 Albums, 2 Movies, 6 TV shows, and a few pictures, and I STILL have over 1GB of memory left, and I still can add an M2 if I want. The Go is flexible enough to were I can truly replace my iPOD and PSP with one device, that incredibly portable.<br /><br />The system comes with Sony's Media Go software. Which is designed to help you download game and store  them between your Go and your PC. The software works well enough allowing you to import libraries already on your PC for quick drag and drop syncing of the Go. The system is slower than an iTunes when doing the same activities, but it works.<br /> <br />Performance and battery life<br /> <br />I've had the Go for a while now, and I have to say for the most part I love it. The handheld is not perfect, but its exact what I would want out of a PSP redesign (that doesn't add anything compatibility breaking like dual sticks). The unit feels great in your hand and even better in your pocket.<br /><br />A lot of people have asked about the units battery life. I have to say I'm very surprised on how good it is. It definitely last just as long as my 2000 with the stock battery did, if not longer. And that's with more heavy wifi use and bluetooth use. I easily get 5-6 hours with the volume at medium and the brightness at low, which with the new screen looks better than my 2000 ever did. Sure if you have the old units you could add the stamina battery or carry additional battery for added battery life, something you can't due with the Go due to is nonuser-replaceable battery. But that added additional bulk to the handheld making it less portable, and making it less likely I would bring it with me. <br /><br />Conclusion<br /> <br />When it comes down to it, the Go is a Great handheld, but its clearly not meant for everyone. If you're like me and you love the PSP, but hate its size and UMDs and prefer digital downloads, or  you want to reduce the number of devices you carry on a daily bases, Go for it (pun intended).Otherwise if you have any interest in used games, or being able to shop in bargain bins for deals, stick with the normal model.

Take the Plunge
I live in Japan, and since the Go was released here one month after it came out in other markets, I had plenty of time to read the reviews. Hopefully you realize, like I did, that a large majority of the negative reviews are from those who have never held the console in their hands. I'll offer my insight as someone who has owned the Go for about a week.<br /><br />Pros: Great games that are easy to download; highly portable; stylish; ample memory; vibrant screen; great ergonomics; blue tooth; Wi-Fi; PS3 syncing; does more than play games (music, videos, photo-viewing, web-browsing, Skype); game-pause feature; value.<br /><br />Cons: For me, none. If you were hoping to be able to transfer UMDs, thrive off of buying/selling used games, don't have a way to download games, or you're not willing to spend $250 on an excellent handheld device, the list of cons grows.<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't be happier with the PSP Go. I had high expectations, and I wasn't disappointed.

Pretty great, actually
There's no amount of hate for the PSPGo, and some of the arguments against purchasing one are hard to counter. That said, I purchased one anyway, and I couldn't be happier with it.<br /><br />First, I'll admit to having owned a PSP-2000 a few years ago. I eventually rid myself of it, mainly because I was doing the vast majority of my gaming at home, and there weren't many games out for the system that really held my interest. With more RPGs out for it now such as Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions and Dissidia, I was all prepared to bite the bullet a 3000, but the notion of carrying around a number of UMDs around with me stopped me. I commute every day and so whatever I bring with me for entertainment needs to be as compact and integrated as possible. There's just no good way to transport UMDs short of buying a carrying case, and throwing one of those into my bag with my laptop, phone, notebooks, MP3 player and associated peripherals was definitely a step beyond my comfort level. Enter the PSPGo.<br /><br />Integrated 16 GB flash memory, negating the need for both UMDs and memory cards? Check. Smaller size, allowing one to pocket the device without exposing half of it to the elements? Yeah, buddy. Incredibly crisp screen resolution? Also present. Considering I'd sold my PSP games along with my unit, yes, I needed to build a library again. That was solved with a simple $50 Playstation Network Card, which gave me enough to buy a whopping seven PSOne games from my earlier years. I was in gaming heaven. I really can't stress how amazing it is to be able to play those games again, and whenever I want, no less.<br /><br />The unit itself really is great. I have fairly large hands and fingers, and I have had no trouble holding and operating the device comfortably and accurately. The sliding mechanism is much like what you'd find in many cell phones nowadays, and it feels sturdy and will likely not break easily. I've always been a fan of Sony's XCrossMediaBar, the operating system of sorts for the PSP and PS3, and navigating it is intuitive and simple.<br /><br />To address a few common complaints about it:<br /><br />First, yes, it's true. The PSPGo only supports wireless-b, which is pretty frustrating if you like to keep your personal wi-fi network up to date. I'm not sure if Sony has any plan to rectify this considering the most obvious work around to this is to download whatever you need onto your PC and then transfer it to the PSP, but it's my major complaint about the product.<br /><br />Second, I've had no problem playing a number of different games on the unit, including classic PSOne RPGs. I can read all text without straining my eyes. I'll state here that I don't wear corrective lenses of any kind, so this experience may be different if you do; my advice is to try it out as much as you can before you purchase it. Simple.<br /><br />Third, some claims regarding the battery life seem to be exaggerated. I charged mine to full capacity right out of the box (which, I expect, some do not do with most new electronic devices despite it being the very first step in any Quick Start Guide) then proceeded to play with it for nearly five hours straight without needed to plug it in. If you turn off redundant, nonessential and unused features (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, anyone?), the unit will go for a very respectable amount of time.<br /><br />Finally, the biggest complaint of all: Sony doesn't seem too eager to make their entire UMD library available for digital purchase, apparently. Really? Bear in mind that this technology launched just over a month ago, and that all sorts of negotiations need to be made with developers to make their software available in Sony's Playstation Network Store. All of this takes time. Sure, the argument could be made that Sony could've had the wheels in motion much earlier, but given the sheer number of games out for the original PSP system, are you really going to fault them for having only a limited number of titles available after the launch? Remember that Nintendo only had a handful of games up for purchase and download when the Wii was released. Give it time, people. Sony may be trying their hand in the casual gamer market, but they're not stupid. They know where their real consumer base is: dedicated gamers who won't run out and buy their newest incarnation unless they have a lot to offer. This includes the PSP library.<br /><br />That said, considering I was most attracted to the portability of the PSPGo combined with the availability of classic PSOne games and the fact that I did not currently have a PSP or any games, this was a great purchase. I couldn't be happier with it.

A review from a first-day original PSP owner
The PSPgo is an interesting device. It would appear to many that this hardware revision seems to have taken one step forward (sleeker design, bluetooth capability, built-in memory) and two steps back (no UMD drive, price, purchases tied to the PSN Store).  I'm here to say: I love my PSPgo.<br /><br />First, a little bit of my background: I was an original adopter of the PSP-1000 system. I love the PSP platform and feel as though the hardware itself as well as many of the platform's games are severely unappreciated.<br /><br />I want to provide some commentary for what kind of customers might be looking into purchasing a PSPgo:<br /><br />1)  The Gadget Geek<br /><br />It's obvious, even from the customer images and official product images, that the PSPgo is one slimmed-down, sexy device.  If you're into gadgets, the PSPgo will not disappoint: this is a much more portable, sleeker device than the PSP 1000 / 3000 systems.  This handheld will fit where the old PSPs won't, that's for sure.  The sliding-open of the controls is addicting; it mimics many of the cell phones that have this kind of mechanism.<br /><br />2)  Someone who is looking into purchasing their first PSP system<br /><br />It's a tough call to truly recommend the PSPgo for those who are looking into purchasing this as their first PSP system.  Personally, I would.  Many probably wouldn't.  As of right now, the PSN Store does not have all of the best PSP games available to download.  However, they do have a fantastic current selection that includes Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee 2, LocoRoco 2 and more.  As of today, they do not have several fantastic games on the PSN Store (Dissidia and Crisis Core, to name a couple).  I can only assume, in time, these will be available.<br /><br />The other consideration is buying used games at stores such as Gamestop.  As a new PSP owner, you probably want to buy a lot of older games that you have yet to enjoy.  These probably come in at fairly cheap used game prices at stores.  If you have a PSPgo system, some of these prices are comparable; some are not.<br /><br />If a first-time PSP owner does decide to purchase a PSPgo system, they don't want to worry about purchasing additional memory right out of the game, which is a nice little bonus.<br /><br />3)  Someone who currently owns a PSP 1000 / 3000<br /><br />If you have the financial means, I think purchasing a PSPgo to compliment your PSP 1000 / 3000 system is a great idea.  This is the kind of customer I am.  I was able to use Amazon's video game trade-in program to knock the price down for the PSPgo system.  I still have my PSP 1000 system around in case I want to play any of the games I have on UMD.  And, not surprisingly (or maybe surprisingly for some), I have yet to have a hankering to go back and play any of the UMD games I own since owning a PSPgo.  And I have some fantastic games on UMD that are not offered as a digital download currently on the PSN Store!<br /><br />And I think this is where the PSPgo system gets a LOT of hate: the whole discussion about not being able to play any UMD games you may currently own.  My thought on that is this: I think before owning a PSPgo, this might be a concern.  But when you have one, you don't have a drive to play any of your UMD games.  I have plenty to play in terms of PSX / PSP games I've already downloaded and have downloaded since owning the system.  I don't know, maybe I'm just a special case or something.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I absolutely love my PSPgo: it's sexy, it's incredibly portable and I love having a whole smattering of games available right there on my system.  The price may be a tad bit high, but if you can swing it, you'll love the PSPgo system.  Since owning my PSPgo, I have not wanted to play any of my current UMD games on my old PSP system.  There's a lot of currently released titles on the PSN Store to satisfy my needs.

Pricey but worth it for gamers on the go
Most of the negative reviews posted here come from the PSP community, which are a backlash of early PSP adopters.  These are unverified purchases from customers who don't even own the PSP Go. With that said, I think some of these reviews have merit, and most do not.  People need to realize that this is made to co-exist with the PSP-3000 (you don't see PSP Go owners posting reviews to bash the 3000 model).  Personally, I did not find the PSP-3000 appealing for the reason that PSP's in general are too bulky to be portable.<br /><br />For me the convenience of carrying a portable system in your pocket without the hassle of carrying several UMDs everywhere you travel is worth it to me.  It actually is remarkable how small the PSP Go is compared to a DS or any PSP model (about the size of an Iphone).  Now $250 is a lot to pay for, but most people seem to glance over the fact that 16gb of memory are included with the system.  $80 extra for 16gb of memory is somewhat reasonable considering how much Sony is charging for their Memory Sticks.  Also, with a little bit of research you'll find that the display screen is better than the 3000 model in terms of refresh rate, colors, and there are no ghosting issues here.  Sure the screen is a little smaller, but it's meant to be portable right?  <br /><br />A feature exclusive to the PSP Go is the save state feature.  This saves the game at the exact point you're playing for future use.  This is not the same as sleep mode that all PSP models have (including this one).  If you're playing an RPG and know there's not a save point for some time; you can use the save state feature; play another game, surf the web, listen to music, watch a movie, and come back to it later rather than sticking it out from sleep mode until you find another save point in the game.  This is a HUGE convenience and something that should get more attention from all reviewers.<br /><br />In terms of actual hardware improvements there are some hits and misses.  The PSP GO is small, which is great for portability, but it takes a while to get accustomed to since it is half the depth when opened.  The analog on the Go are an advantage over earlier models, there is a noticeable difference in resistance compared to other PSPs which allow for more precise controls. The battery, on the other hand, is something left to be desired.  Battery life on Go isn't any better than other PSP's and the fact that it's not interchangeable means that you're limited to 3-5 hours until you can find an electrical outlet.  I found that portable USB charging devices do work with this system (look for Duracell), and they are great for long car trips.  Still, it would be nice if battery life was improved over earlier models considering this does not have a UMD drive and should require less power to operate.<br /><br />The PSP Go obviously isn't for everyone, but if you're still using a PSP-1000 I would suggest the upgrade.  You'll be surprised how much more you'll play when it's this portable, rather than second guessing whether or not it's worth it to bring your other PSP.

I'm Glad I Upgraded
I was skeptical about upgrading to the Go from the 3000, but now glad I made the move.  I thought there were was no reason to upgrade until I realized, I just wasn't using the PSP 3000 for several reasons: the size of unit wasn't portable, carrying several UMDs wasn't feasible and I had never taken an interest in connecting the PSP to the PS3.  Now that I have the Go, the PSP has become my portable entertainment center.  I use the internal memory to play music, watch movies and keep several games and demos in the game section.  For music, it is just as good as my Iphone and the bluetooth capabilities let me do this wirelessly, movies look better on the Go than the Iphone and the movie controls are great.  The games are no different than the previous PSP, just easier to carry without the UMDs.   I also have taken advantage of using the Go with my PS3, the remote play is great.  If I am in a wirelss zone, I can turn on the PS3 away from home and watch movies or music on the PS3 with same quality as the Go's internal memory.  If you on the borderline about getting a Go, take the plunge, I doubt you will regret the decision.

Awesome device!
The PSPgo exceeded my expectations. It's smaller form factor, built-in storage, and features make it a great portable gaming device. Plus, I use it for my music and video player, and it does those two features very well. I much preferred the white PSPgo to the 3000 because I'm just not a fan of UMD discs nor the larger form factor of the PSP 3000. Great little device!

What is Everyone Expecting?
A few things first... I don't own a PSP 3000, and I have no UMD discs to transfer. I'm a lifelong Sony customer, and I've been burned by them many times before--the stack of MiniDiscs to my left as I write this is a nice reminder. <br /><br />I keep coming back because their products appeal to me--they're often innovative, they look/feel great, and their audio quality is in my opinion, always the benchmark. Yes, Sony's products are expensive, but so is everything Apple releases. <br /><br />I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I enjoy playing for a few hours in an airport or on a flight while traveling for business. I've been using an iPod Touch in this capacity, and while it's a magnificent device, I'm just not a touch-screen gamer. <br /><br />I also wanted something with a bit bigger screen, better battery life, and better sound. Essentially, I was looking for a device between the Touch and an Archos. The PSP Go turned out to be the perfect size with the features I wanted. <br /><br />A few observations:<br /><br />PROS: The screen is knockout gorgeous, and better than the iPod Touch. Video playback is beautiful. And it plays Divx!<br /><br />Audio quality is Sony-level outstanding.<br /><br />Feels great in my hands, sleek, sexy design, slide out controls, and a nice compact size (slightly bigger than a Touch.) That was the main reason I never bought a PSP 3000--too big. <br /><br />The ability to listen to music, watch video, play "real" games without leaving fingerprints all over the screen, check the Web via Wi-Fi, listen to/watch podcasts, and store it in my bag without any annoying peripherals is a joy.<br /><br />External slot for Memory Stick Micro means it's not "stuck" with an out-of-the-box storage capacity.  <br /><br />CONS: It wouldn't be Sony without a suspicious pricetag attached, for both hardware and software. However, Archos is still the price-gouge leader on portable devices, and Apple isn't far behind, so Sony isn't alone in that club.<br /><br />Podcast subscriptions from the Sony Media Go software are limited. However, if you go to iTunes, you can right click on any podcast, select "Copy Podcast URL" and paste it into the Media Go "Subscribe to URL" option. It's worked for every podcast I selected.<br /><br />OVERALL: An outstanding, ultra-portable multimedia device that is about much more than games. However, Sony needs to find it in their DNA to lower the prices. They did with the PS3--so it's not impossible, but the window is closing.

Excellent product...but its not for everyone.
The PSP Go is a terrific product...but it's not for everyone.<br /><br />The main thing people need to know about the PSP Go is that It is a all-digital system. Meaning that you cannot buy games/movies for It at any physical store. You can only buy games/movies for the PSP Go from the Playstation Network. I'm not sure If you HAVE to have high speed Internet for It..but If you do,and are Interested In this product...it comes with Instructions on how to buy content.<br /><br />The PSP Go is the latest Incarnation of sony's Playstation Portable..otherwise called the PSP. It can play videogames,movies(that you can either buy from the Playstation Network...for the rest of this review..will be called the PSN).You can put your own personal photos onto it from a computer,and you can also put on your personal music onto it. You can also put your own movies that you have on your computer on It If you know how. there are online guides on how to do this and maybe even In the Intsructions that come In the box.<br /><br />The upgrades top the PSP Go are that it has blue-tooth technology. So you can tehter it with your bluetooth phone and go on the Internet with your Go via your phone,you can even synch it up with your blue-tooth deck In your car and listen to your games/music/movies through your car speakers. And If you have a Playstation 3(or just Its controller) you can synch the PSP Go with the PS3 controller and use the PS3 controller as the PSP Go's controller. It also comes with 16GB of memory though 2 GB's are held back for system specs or whatever you wanna call it..so you REALLY only get 14GB...still PLENTY of space.<br /><br />About the PSN: The PSN is where you will be buying games for the PSP Go. The PSN makes available games to purchase for the PSP/PSP Go. Aswell as movies,TV shows,demos,etc.<br /><br />Here Is the part that I dont like:<br /><br />The part that I dont like is the availablity of games on the PSN. Before the PSP Go was released...the PSN(which Is updated every Thursday) would get MAYBE 1-2 PSP games available for purchase(and In my opinion..not all of the updates are good. I buy TONS of games and there would be times where I wouldnt buy anything at all).<br /><br />When the PSP was released on October 1st...the PSN received a MASSIVE update of games...which was GREAT..but not ALL the games In the PSP's catalog was there and nobody knows If they ever will be.<br /><br />From what I've read on videogame message boards...only Sony's games themselves will be available on the PSN that same day..which Is great! But what about games from other companies? From what I hear..it's up to that videogames company to decide if they even want that game available on the PSN. So that means if a videogame comes out that Is NOT from Sony that youo REALLY want to play...you may NEVER play it..atleast on the PSP Go. Though it should be said that most of the "big name" games SHOULD be availalbe..but dont hold me to that.<br /><br />It should be said that If you are worried about the above: Buy a PSP 1000,2000,or 3000 model Instead. These models can play physical UMD's(thats what they call the games that you buy In a store) ASWELL as the games that are on the PSN. The games downloaded from the PSN to a older model PSP will be stored on that systems Memory Stick Pro Duo.<br /><br />I personally have had a 1000 model,sold it for a 2000,sold THAT for a 3000,then sold THAT aswell as most of my games for the PSP GO( I like to have the newest version of everything :p ) and I dont regret it.<br /><br />The selection on the PSN Is a nice size and most of the games that I sold are on there(sadly not all) so I just downloaded them again. The big part of my decision to get a Go was the fact that I could have ALL my games on the system and not have to carry around a whole bunch of UMD's. I never carried more that 2 or 3 anyway because..well..I jsut didnt want to carry all of them In fear I would lose em or something like that and just for the Inconvinience. But with the Go..I have ALL my games on me..which Is great.<br /><br />Almost forgot something about the memory...It comes with 14GB of free space..but you can always buy M2 memory cards to add even MORE memory. I plan to buy a 16GB card soon(only because I've never seen a 32GB m2 card).<br /><br />Thats my review and I hope it helps you In your purchase.<br /><br />Oh! If you decided to get a PSP(any model) PLEASE get a protective case and screen guards. These machines are expensive after all and case and screen guard will help you to protect your entertainment Investment.<br /><br />Happy Gaming! ;)

Good value + Excellent case
I purchased this case for my daughter's PSP 3000 based on the reviews and features. We are both pleased with the sturdiness, protection and quality. I am very happy that I chose this case over others and worth the price. <br /><br />First thoughts with product in hand and filled with PSP/ect:<br />*  Case feels like quality, formed rubber exterior, properly & thoroughly padded. Attractive.<br />*  Solid zipper.<br />*  Belt/strap loop on back. Also clip loop. Nice to have choices.<br />*  PSP is surrounded by soft padding and is strapped down.<br />*  Ample storage (2 dedicated game slots with extra storage for more games or accessories like headphones, cleaning cloth, etc.<br /><br />After a couple weeks of use, we have NO complaints. No trouble with scratching from the smooth rivet inside the PSP section that connects the clip loop to the outside (although I am watching that for potential problems.) and the case is holding up to continual use. I can easily put 5 games/movies in this case (2 in dedicated slots, 2 in extra storage area with headphones and 1 in the PSP itself) and this travels well. At this point, I would recommend this case and believe that it is the best value for the price, excellent quality.<br />

Perfect for your PSP
I bought two of these for my daughters because they carry their PSP's everywhere.  It can carry games/movies and keeps the PSP protected.  For the price and quality this item is ideal for any PSP owner.

It does what you expect
I got this a few months ago for my psp slim, and it works fine. It protects my psp perfectly, and it has the necessary space for everything. I even carry my USB cable inside the case and it's a long cable; and everything fits without problems. <br /><br />A smart buy for anyone and a great way to protect your psp. Very Recommended!

Good quality case
Bought for PSP 3000. PSP fits well. Has slots for 2 games. Extra pouch holds at least 2 more games. Case appears to be of good quality. I would recommend. I don't see how this case could scratch the PSP as another reviewer has documented as it is all soft inside.

Great Travel Case
This case is made of flexible water-resistant material that has a good level of padding to protect the PSP inside.  I found that it's exactly what I needed (and looks good as a bonus).  <br /><br />Many PSP cases have features or accessories that I just didn't need or want to pay for, whereas this case holds the console, a couple of discs and is well made enought that I can trust it to keep everything as safe as it can be from accidental damage.  <br />

Valued
When I travel and have to pack everything in their own respectable cases, I'm just glad that my psp slim has a home, with pockets for mem cards and such.  I wish now, that the extra life charger handles I have had a case too, I guess.

Super*b* Travel Case
The best feature about this case is easily the low price.  As of this writing you can pick up this case for under $10, which is impressive since this case has a rigid shell and therefore better protects your PSP from the rigors of mobile gaming.  Fortunately, in spite of the hard shell, the case remains sleek and slim.  It will consume only slightly more space in your bag than the PSP itself.<br /><br />The case closes with a heavy duty zipper and features a carabiner hook, which is handy for securing the case to your bag, belt loop, etc.  Apart from the hook, the outside of the case is matte black, smooth and simple, devoid of logos, patterns or textures.  The average observer might not recognize this as a PSP case.  Personally I would consider this a bonus since you probably don't want your PSP to grow legs and walk away on you.  <br /><br />The interior of the case holds the PSP quite snugly.  The device will actually sort of pop in and out of the case.  This is generally a good thing except for an exposed rivet inside the case.  If left alone this might wind up scratching a small corner of your PSP.  It's a simple remedy, though, as I just popped in a small piece of Dr. Scholls pad.<br /><br />Apart from the PSP you won't fit much inside the case.  The centre flap has padding on the PSP side to keep your screen protected.  (Although I still recommend investing in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ORTCAQ">screen overlay</a>).  The upper side of the flap includes two fitted web slots for UMDs.<br /><br />The upper lid of the case has only a small elastic web.  There is a little give to it so you can easily fit a couple more UMDs and a USB charge cable but don't plan on bringing your wall charger or AV cables.  Memory sticks should be able to squeak in as well but pay care when opening and closing the case so as not to let them fall out.<br /><br />On the whole I doubt you'll be able to find a better case or a better price.  If you plan to take your PSP with you frequently, I highly recommend keeping it safe with this case.<br />

Cheap and good
This inexpensive case is much better than others that cost much more.<br /><br />For $9 you get a case that can hold a PSP, at least four UMDs (one in the system), a spare battery, ear buds and a few memory cards. Watch for the rivet issue discussed here. I simply stuck a piece of foam on top of it and the issue was rectified. The only other con is the weak looking zipper but what do you expect for the price? Buy two.

Great case. Excellent value.
When I bought my husband a PSP I looked at cases....knew it would get thrown into his duffel bag or pack along with all sorts of other things and it would need a sturdy case to help it take that abuse. This case is PERFECT. The cover really helps protect the PSP. The pockets fit up to 4 games. It still looks the same today as it did the day I gave it to him. Great for keeping your PSP safe when you are traveling..

Good and Durable
I purchased this through my credit card's reward points.<br /><br />Overall, I'm left wondering if the hard plastic case is easier temp wise, but with a rubber casing and storage for UMDs all at once, this one's really not a bad deal. I use it with my PSP 3000, and I plan to keep it. I left it open in the car on my way to town, since it was really hot. I don't know how wise it is to have a PSP out in hot weather, probably not so much, but it still works.<br /><br />Like other reviews here, it pretty much holds up to what even the product info says. I hold four UMDs in the looser pocket, and you're given an extra two individual pockets on a flap that in effect, covers and protects the screen while closed. The two individual pockets may hold memory cards, but as easy as the UMDs can fall out when you open it, it's probably better to leave the extra cards at home, who knows, maybe you can decide for yourself, but I haven't tried it yet to see...:[ Good case, worth the money, if you can buy cheap go for it.<br /><br />While the fancy hard plastic case by Sony is flashy and whatever, this one is not, for good reason: it's discreet.

Oh my God of War
When I saw that I had a package yesterday, I opened it up...and then nerd glee ran through my hands to my arms and then to my heart. Kratos had arrived. <br /><br />I ran to my shop (actually I walked as fast as a grandma around a shopping mall) to open this tantalizing package of war. Screw work!! Actually I cant do that because I'm in Iraq and I have to get things done to help protect the troops. But once I was done with all the work for the day I popped the game in the PSP and hit the power button.<br /><br />When I began to play, I couldnt believe the graphics. The PSP is seriously a PS2 in your hands. The game is just beautiful. The levels are nicely done. They even have the camera effect where it pulls out very far just to show you how small you really are compared to your surroundings. Your chains graphical effects look really good and even better as you upgrade them. Even the graphics for little things look great...for instance...when you open a chest under water, the chest begins to release thousands of tiny bubbles while you struggle to open it. I just thought that was a nice little touch. <br /><br />The gameplay is incredible. Kratos is extremely easy to control. I'm just amazed at how fluid he moves. Bashing baddies...lifting them in the air...grappling them back onto the ground..and then finishing them off is nothing but a few well pressed buttons mashes. Not hard at all. And I'm not talking about the button sequence fighting either. Speaking of those, there are some really good ones in this game.<br /><br />The sound is sharp and pleasing. The musical score can really put you in a mood to kill every living thing around...but then make you want to stop and smell the ashes of a burning hades. If you've played part 1 or 2, then you know what to expect with the sound effects, and it's here also. Sound great in my Bose Earbuds.<br /><br />I have only a COUPLE of gripes about the game. I'm not completely done with it, but I can tell the game is going to be short. That's going to be a downer because I really like this game and just dont want it to end for at least 2 week..heh. Another gripe I have is that the game froze up on me once. Only once..so hopefully not again. Just make sure you save every time you get the chance.<br /><br />Something that isnt a gripe, but a 'Just so ya know', playing on Normal is pretty dang easy. There are 4 modes...Easy, Normal, Hard, and God (which is greyed out at first). If you are pretty experienced with the game, I'd go with playing Hard. <br /><br /><br />Something parents should think about when pondering if they should get this game for their youngin. This game is based during when Rome was the hot spot. So when you see some of the female Gods, usually they are topless. Also there is a scene where Kratos frees two topless women and well...gets to have sex with them. You dont actually see it, but they show a vase or something rocking around while you hit a series of buttons to pleasure them both. Funny if you are older, but maybe not funny for parents with children. <br /><br /><br />All in all, I recommend this game completely for your PSP. It is definitely in my top 5 games for the PSP. That would include Ratchet and Clank, FF Tactics, Burnout Legends, and I dont have a 5th one yet..(it'll probably be the new Final Fantasy). <br /><br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Well after beating the game about an hour after posting this review, I will say it's definitely a short game. Also make sure you stay for after the credits. Well...you'll have to because you cant skip cut scenes (which I LOATHE that you cant do it in any game).

Oh yeah baby, Kratos is finally here on the PSP
God of War stands as one of Sony's best original franchises, and now the vengeance-driven Kratos and his deadly chains have come to the PSP.  Fans of the series will also be more than happy to know that God of War: Chains of Olympus stands as the best action title to hit Sony's portable system yet, as it nearly flawlessly brings everything that has made the God of War series so good, and packs it into one small disc.  Taking place before the events of the original God of War, Chains of Olympus finds Kratos as general serving the gods, and also finds him struggling with obeying his orders, or doing what he feels he should.  Undoubtedly the best looking game to hit the PSP yet, God of War: Chains of Olympus retains the excellent production values, addictive combat, tight controls, solid puzzle elements, and unlockable extras that will keep you glued to the game.  The only real downside to Chains of Olympus is that as a whole, the game is too short.  This one flaw is acceptable though, as Chains of Olympus boasts a brilliant score, more fantastic voice acting, and some dynamic action sequences that are easily the best to be seen on the PSP yet.  All in all, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a more than welcome debut of Kratos on the PSP, and is by far the best action game to hit the PSP yet.  Needless to say, if you own a PSP, God of War: Chains of Olympus is an absolute must own, and the definition of "killer app".

A Remarkable Game To Behold And The Greatest Game For The PSP!
Simply put, this is the best PSP game on the market and one of the most stunning handheld games ever made. The production value is through the roof. I have never played a handheld game that was of this caliber, if it were twice as long I would call it the single greatest achievement on any portable system. <br /><br />From the moment I started the game, I was emotionally involved and I did not want to put the game down. I had not played the other GOW games, so this was all new to me... and I was hooked. The action was intense, but the puzzles were never complex.<br /><br />The few issues that I had were with the length of the game, and the thumb pad, some fights hurt! <br /><br />If you have a PSP, you have to play this game... I hope this is the harbinger of the future for the PSP, because it proves that Sony's little console is quite something!

God of War: Chains of Olympus.........
Sad but true, I've never played God of War before. I've heard so much about the game and, considering it has David Jaffe's involvement in its' history, you'd think I'd have already played it. Alas, I haven't. Yet, I see the commercial on tv for this game and hear rantin' & ravin' from my friends about the game, I decide to get the PSP installment. Man (or Woman, whatever the case may be..;)), I was missing out on this for this long?? This game blew me away. It's exciting, addictive and challenging. God of War: Chains of Olympus is simply put 'the best looking title' on the system, bar none, yet. I've never seen graphics look quite this good on the system. Honestly. If graphics can get any better than this on the PSP, I'll be amazed. The environments were simply breathtaking, nothing like I've seen before. Course, Ready At Dawn made Daxter visually appealing for its' time. <br /><br />For an action game, this game truly delivers. Especially where the story is concerned. Makes me wish some developers would make portable versions of some of my favorite games(like Shadowman, Bloodrayne, Legacy of Kain or Devil May Cry). <br /><br />There's plenty of bonus content in the game that makes playing through a few times more appealing but I have a problem with the game's length. It is just too short for this kind of game. I managed to get through it in a little over 8 hours. It is, however, a portable game so I have to take that into account. Memory restrictions and whatnot, withstanding, it should be understood. <br /><br />God of War: Chains of Olympus is a remarkable achievement on the PSP. It's a 'must-have' purchase for all owners of a PSP. This game just goes to prove that Ready At Dawn is a force to be reckoned with in the handheld world. I'm expecting great things from this bunch on their next game.

The Spartan is on the PSP - PREPARE FOR GLORY!
Well, it's been a long time coming, but Kratos has made his way to the small screen of our PSP's, and it was well worth waiting for!<br /><br />From the description of the game on Amazon, it talks about epic gameplay on the PSP - but Chains of Olympus does more than this...it makes me forget that I'm playing on a PSP! Why? Because the graphics are absolutely breathtaking! The camera angles are a perfect match to the Playstation 2 counterparts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XL3BA">God of War</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6SPHI">God of War 2</a>.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you get to follow along with Kratos in his forced servitude to the Olympian Gods.<br /><br />There are a lot of combat moves, most of which are transfers from the other God of War games...but had to be changed with the lack of a second analog stick. Surprisingly, after a few hours of playing, you won't even notice because you adapt to the gameplay quickly. There are new weapons to power up, but the good ol' Blades of Chaos are right where they belong, in Kratos' hot little hands.<br /><br />The boss battles are excellent. However, some of them will take a little intuition to figure out exactly how to defeat them, but hey, that's what God of War is all about...try, try again while slicing and dicing!<br /><br />As far as the puzzle solving goes, some are definitely easier than others. Anyone familiar with the first 2 God of War games or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035XUZ">Resident Evil</a> should be able to figure out most of the puzzles without too much difficulty.<br /><br />My only gripe about the game: As other reviewers have mentioned, it takes about 7 to 8 hours to solve it, and the PSP battery will not last anywhere near that long. But even if you run out of juice, you can plug the PSP in to recharge, and you'll pick up right where the game left off!<br /><br />This is one of the best features of the PSP, being able to turn the unit off and pick up the gameplay when we're ready to.<br /><br />With the unlockable content, advanced gameplay and extra costumes, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a MUST HAVE for the PSP.<br /><br />Eat well, Spartan...FOR TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!!!

ONE SWEEEEEET RIDE!
I'm a 54 yr. old grandma.  I'm not a "gamer" and I don't usually play a lot of video games but when my kids purchased a psp for me 2 yrs. ago on a birthday I was in awe!  I purchased the Chains of Olympus game without hesitation, already having played GOW one & two, I was a little anxious to get this one!  My waiting was over and it is everything I expected it to be!  The only downside to this game is it is short lived.  You can finish it in about 5-6 hrs of steady play and beat it.  The action is quick, surprising at times, and the scenes a little breathtaking.  Greek mythology is one of my passions and may be the reason for my love of this particular game series.  If you enjoy that type of game (God knows I love the story line and the music) you will not be dissapointed when you purchase this game.  It is colorful and it is BIG!  I couldn't put it down for days after I first got it.  You'll enjoy it too!!!

The Gods Get Tiny
Having played the other two God of War titles, I still didn't expect much from a small-screen PSP game.  I have to say I've been incredibly impressed with Chains of Olympus for the PSP:  the game looks and plays 99% identical to its big-screen counterparts.  <br /><br />(For kicks, you *can* grab an A/V cable and play it on your TV...but I digress)<br /><br />Just as with other titles in the series, Chains of Olympus provides you with an ongoing storyline, heaps of slaughter, and many different combinations to produce the right effect in battle.  It also gives you the ability to choose which skill areas to "level" as you collect orbs, and how far you want to raise them.  Last, we have the in-game plot sequences and the unusual puzzles (reader beware:  your sexual skills will be put to the test shortly into the first chapter).<br /><br />There are differences, but thus far I see only minor ones:  for example, camera rotation can be a bit difficult, and dodge-rolls require tapping both shoulder buttons.  These are still somewhat easily worked around: with a little time and practice, a player can adapt pretty easily.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of the God of War games and want the same experience on the go, you won't be disappointed.  If you're new to God of War, this is what you'll get on the big screen, too--you will enjoy Chains of Olympus as much as you'd enjoy the others.

The must-have game for PSP
I got this game with the God of War PSP pack, mostly because I wanted the newer PSP and it seemed like a nice perk to get a game with it. After having played it, I can honestly say that this game is probably the only PSP game that you NEED to own. As a fair warning for parents, it is rated "M" for a reason.<br /><br />Having said that, the "M" rating is what makes the game so great for people like myself. There's nothing more satisfying than ripping the head off a Medusa and pounding your dagger into the eye of a cyclops. I've never played any God of War games before this one, but so far, I am hooked.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that it is too short, but for a PSP game, it seems long enough for me. There are some good plot points, but not enough to slow down the gameplay, which is a good thing in this case.<br /><br />The graphics are amazing and the controls are well-executed. If I had to dock the game for anything, though, it would be that there are a lot of different button combos to keep track of, as is typical of any game in this category. However, if tearing apart bad guys brings a smile to your face, this is a game you need.

I can't feel my fingers. That's normal, right?
Being a relative newbie to gaming per se, I doubt I can offer a subjective analysis (sic) of the game. I can tell you that I'd ignored pretty much everything and everybody the last 2 weeks I spent in front of the console.<br /><br />The game play is immersive, the environment rendered is stunning considering the console and the production values rival those of a feature length film. The game hooks you immediately thanks to couple of monsters than make some brilliant appearances; and yet manages to shock and awe at every turn.<br /><br />The background score and great voice acting set this apart from every other third person shooter/slasher in the genre (I'm looking at you MGS). The physics engine is noteworthy but I'm fairly sure the inherent complexity and superior AI had a lot to do with the game being short.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the game is rather epic in it's ambition and actually manages to resonate emotionally with the player. Well, at least this player.

The God of War Returns!
To be honest I have been a bit disappointed with games on the PSP.  I've tried several and found the controls cumbersome and clumsy.  I actually recently purchased my PSP more for its multi-media functions and Wi-Fi Capabilities.   I have been a huge GoW fan since the 1st game on PS2 and was very skeptical about playing it on the PSP;  I however I could not resist the call of  Kratos.  Sony did not disappoint. Playing Chains of Olympus on the PSP so much like playing GoW on the PS2, I fear for my "O" button.  The graphics are simply amazing for the PSP.  I find the only noticeable difference is the smaller screen.  The environments are just as rich and the action just as intense.  I have fought about 2 bosses so far and look forward to losing many hours delivering the message of the gods with wraith of my blades. <br />                                                                         <br />                                                                             <br />

Bought the PSP just for this...
Like so many, I'm just one more GOW fan--and though I have nothing new to say about the game that someone else hasn't already, I can offer one more voice to the choir for the proverbial singing of praises towards this game.  <br /><br />Yes, the graphics are absolutely beautiful.  No, I've never owned a PSP before buying this game but I have seen plenty of games displayed on the portable units of others.  This is definitely the best I've seen thus far.<br />Other reviewers have noted that while playing, the presentation was so spectacular that they forget they were playing on a PSP...I too became immediately oblivious to what I was holding in my hands. <br /><br />The music?  Of course, it was excellent.  As we came to expect no less after our first go-around with Kratos as well as the fantastic sequel, the sound quality along with the musical score in Chains of Olympus undoubtedly sets the bar that will find rival designers and studios struggling hard to emulate.<br /><br />The story was short and the characters lack the depth and scope compared to those in GOW1 & GOW2--but I was prepared for that.  Thanks to the other helpful reviews, I didn't work myself up to naively think this was going to be the same type of gaming experience the PS2 predecessors afforded, but compared to the other PSP games out there (which is, in fact, a more fair comparison), and as attested by many, many, many PSP gamers--this is a knockout!! <br /><br />So there you go, thanks to God of War:Chains of Olympus, I'm just one more happy fan of Kratos...and a PSP noob.  (Compliments to Sony for finding so many ways to take so much of my money...can't wait until I have to shell out even more to buy a PS3 for GOW3 [Sigh]...oh well.)<br />

best game on psp i've ever played
I've never played GOW or GOW2 before so I'm a newbie to this game. Due to the high ratings people gave I decided to give it a try. It's the best game I've ever played on psp. If you own a psp and you're old enough to play this game, you need to play it, otherwise you don't know what you've missed. <br /><br />The graphic's amazing. The game control is the best I've experienced on psp. The game designer made so many different combos for attacks and magic with the available keys on psp. There are four different difficulty levels so it will be fun and challenging for everyone. And you will also learn some neat stuff from Greek mythology. <br /><br />In conclusion, this is an epic game.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
definitely one of the better psp games
if you have played the previous god of war games, this is not one you should miss.  there are a couple things missing, like a lack of magic abilities and you will be using your blades of chaos alot, but overall the gameplay and story that god of war is so well known for will keep you entertained.  the story is a prequel to the first god of war, and there is lots of bloody goodness to be had.  the controls are take care of quite well.  Rolling is hard to get used to, but once you get the feel for the controls, you will be rolling around just as easily as if you had the control stick. Definitely get it if you can find a used copy or if you rent games, and consider buying it new for a good price.

Every bit as good as the console
There's little to write about this game. It stands up to the enjoyment of the console versions in every way. If you like the series, this is a must buy and the only way to enjoy Kratos on the go

Fantastic addition to the God of War franchise
Let me just start out by saying that I bought my PSP on launch day.  After playing Lumines to death, just like everyone else, my PSP was nothing more than an overpriced paperweight 2 years or so.  This God of War game was honestly the first piece of compeling software that made me want to buy a new game for the system.  To be fair, I am a fan of the franchise and have played through both 1 and 2 multiple times.  I was very concerned that the control scheme would not translate well to the PSP.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  This game has all the polish of the other 2 games in the franchise and works beautifully on the PSP.  The controls are crisp and precise.  The combo system is completely intact and adds several new weapons and magic items to your arsenal.  The only complaint I have about this game is that it did not come out a year or two sooner.  If it had, The portable landscape would likely be very different.  This game is the killer app that Sony has sorely needed for the PSP.  Since playing this game, I have fallen in love with my PSP all over again.  I have probably purchase 10 or 12 games since beating this and have found that there are many good titles out there now.  If you are a fan of God of War, buy this game.  You will not be disapointed.

What I have been looking for
Was looking for a game that was very entertaining and visually awesome.  This is it!  I don't know how people have finished it so quickly and I get mesmerized by the graphics. My hands cramped up a few times playing it. Some of the combinations required fast responses. Guess I am slowing down...:-)<br />Definitely for mature users and helps pass the time for sure here in Iraq.<br />A must own!

Good Gory Fun
Summary: God of War: Chains of Olympus has you playing as Kratos, one of the beastliest men ever to walk on the face of the earth. Take down a Basilisk, punish a God, subdue a Titan and more in this epic journey set in ancient Greece. In addition to visually impressive pre-rendered cutscenes, this game boasts some of the best graphics I've seen on the PSP so far. The gameplay is insane, with moves that defy gravity and powerful magical spells. The game even has some puzzles for you to solve, in addition to intense button-mashing sequences which just might wear down your PSP buttons. The story is short, but hey- quality over quantity. Ready at Dawn studios has made some great games for the PSP, but this one takes the cake.<br /><br />Gameplay - Five Stars<br />This has got to be on of the most fun games I've every played on the PSP. There are just so many ways to take down your opponents. But don't think that it's a walk in the park; some Boss Fights are extremely challenging and parts of the game can be frustrating. When you kill enemies, you get red orbs which can be used to upgrade your magic, and learn new moves. The game also gives you fun puzzles to solve, which involve a bit of thinking, but nothing frustrating. <br /><br />Story - Five Stars<br />If I could use one word to describe it, it would be: Epic. This story will unless you hate fighting gods, or taking down a Titan, then you'll love it. I did, and as you can see from all these other reviews, they did too. I won't reveal the storyline, but remember: epic.<br /><br />Online Play - Nonexistent<br />You don't honestly expect online play for a game like this, do you?<br /><br />Final Verdict - Five Stars<br />Let me tell you, I beat this game three times. And all three times, it was worth every minute. This game keeps you on your toes. Yes, what everyone says is true, it's short. But as before mentioned, quality gameplay over quantity.<br /><br />

A masterpiece
I was unfamilier with the other GoW games and bought it because of all the positive reviews.  I was not disappointed, and I am not a FPS gamer at all. The graphics are top-notch, and even if you are uncoordinated you should be able to slug through on the easy level with no problems at all. Then you'll want to go back and replay the game at a higher level once you've got your skills perfected.  If you are an expert at these games God mode should have you busy for a while.<br /><br />There is no reason not to add the game to your collection. I really doubt the reviewers that claim they can complete the game in less than 4 hours, there are a lot of puzzles to solve, some that will have you scratching your head, but they are a nice break in the action.<br /><br />It's a pefectly balanced game, with great graphics, great plot, dead-on controls.  I wouldn't change a thing.  You won't be dissapointed in this game.

GOD of War COO THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I cannot believe how this little PSP does it!!! I have a question or request!?!?!Will the guys that made God of War 1,2 and the prequel teach all other software teams how to make games like this!!!! Incredible detail, hardly any loading times, great music, no slow down in action speed and cinematic cut sequences!!!! I still cant believe how good this game is!!! <br /><br />The controls are excellent and the game play and puzzle solving is ridiculous!!! I did have to run around in a few levels to find my way out but that only took about 30 minutes and its because I didn't look around after I pulled the wall out. =)<br /><br />I simply love this game. The only thing is I see this coming to an end pretty soon but I will probably pop in the Spartan level and go back at it!!!

outstanding, but short
this gow game for psp is outstanding but to short, i started playing the game on thursday when i went to pick up my reservation and by saturday evening i finished the game. if it was a little longer like the other gow games it would have been sweet. there were some parts in the game where i got stuck and with some exploration i figured out the solutions to many puzzles.

Fantastic franchise!
I've played with many PSP games including the Syphon Filter franchise, GOW has to be one of the best out there.  The graphics, music and game play is top notch.<br /><br />I'm about half way through the game. I'm playing the easy level and would suggest people choose the normal level to start as easy is too easy.<br /><br />Let's hope they bring out other series soon, including a PS3 version!

A great addition to the series
God of War: Chains of Olympus is the most recent installment of the venerable God of War series, and the first time the title has graced the PSP.  God of war is set in a psuedo Greek mythology.  There, the main character - a hyper masculine Spartan warrior named Kratos AKA Ghost of Sparta AKA God of War who killed his wife and daughter in a bloodfrenzy - sets forth on a herculean task involving direct contact and often conflict with the gods and titans themselves.  Gameplay is a successful mix of twitch based and buttonmashing.  Themes and content are adult oriented, featuring topless women, implied sexual activity and innuendo, extreme violence and blood.<br /><br />I tempered my excitement for a the possibility of a great action game on the system with the knowledge that some good titles have had rocky transitions across from the Playstation to it's portable counterpart.  Graphics and control can become insufferable when brought to a portable.  Admittedly, I had a demo disk to help soothe those concerns, but I couldn't be certain until the full game was in my hot little hands.<br /><br />Despite my concerns I preordered my copy, and in my excitement I mistakenly showed up a day early at my local game shop to pick it up.  <br /><br />Controls:<br />All fears are immediately allayed.  The control scheme is picked up quickly and is very much old hat for veteran God of War players.  I expect that players new to the series will find the controls intuitive and relatively easy to get accustomed to.  You will make use of every button on the machine, but it is never cumbersome, the game responds beautifully.  You will be an graceful cyclone of death in short order.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />While I can't claim to have seen all titles for the PSP or even all the action titles, I can say Chains of Olympus likely meets or exceeds the best gamers have encountered on the system.  The detail that you can pick up on the small screen is very impressive, and at no point did I feel I was visually constrained by the environment.  The game used huge zoom outs typical in previous titles to the same great effect.  Camera angles were a little quirky at times, I found that I would often loose sight of my enemies on the bottom of the screen.  This was only problematic when the enemy had a charge or projecile attack.<br /><br />Story:<br />The story is set prior to the other titles, but after the murder of his wife and daughter.  The timeline is a bit shakey there as I thought the first God of War took off immediately after he killed his family thus becoming the Ghost of Sparta, but my memory is a bit fuzzy.  I'll be throughly vague as to the details because there is typically just enough story in these games to move the carnage along.  Something has gone terribly wrong that threatens the fate of the world.  Kratos has been tasked by the gods to set things back in order, much to his chagrin.  It follows the same formula as the other games in the series, of "Who do I have to beat clues out of next", but before you can start giving this any honest thought, you're rending enemies limb from limb again.  It was a good mix of carnage to story for the genre though, and the journey through the story was an enjoyable one.<br /><br />Miscellanea:<br />The UI is exactly the same as the previous titles.  The goals for collecting the Gorgon eyes and the Pheonix feathers to increase your HP and MP is the same.  There is a secondary weapon called Zeus' Fist, that is fun to use and powerful in many situations.  There are multiple spells that are all typical fare with the series.  Collecting orbs for upgrades still there, all of the old attacks are still there, in short - nothing has really changed except the platform.<br /><br />I'm not one to race to the end as I have a job and kids and tend to play after the kids go to bed, but I completed the game within about 8 hours of play.  The shortness of the game has been tempered somewhat by unlockables.  Upon completion of the game you unlock several other features of the game.  You unlock "God Mode" which is the maximum difficulty.  Various "Hades Challenges" become available to complete sequentially, each one unlocking the next challenge.  Various videos and other odds and ends also become available.  Ultimately completing the game felt rewarding, which I would expect is the goal.  I suspect as I start through God Mode and undertake the challenges of Hades I should be able to stretch the game out a bit longer.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the God of War series, you will almost certainly enjoy Chains of Olympus.  New players who enjoy the theme or the style will likely find themselves looking for the old titles to get the full story.  The violence is over the top and it's treatment of women may be viewed as misogynist as is the rest of the series.  Those who are looking for a game for young children or find that this subject matter offends your sensibility should look elsewhere.  All said, I am happy with the game, and would recommend it to friends, but won't loan out my copy because Hades second challenge is already kicking my butt.

PSP 3000, the next step in PSP Dominance
So this is the 3rd iteration for the Playstation Portable.<br />I've personally experienced the first 2, selling my original PSP Phat for the PSP Slim (2000).<br />I've done the same again and sold my slim and bought the 3000.<br /><br />The improvements over the PSP 2000, are a improved LCD screen which I must say is pretty improved, and a built in Microphone. (Finally I can make use of the skype feature as well as chat online in psp games.)<br /><br />So is this a justifiable upgrade? For the improvements not really. <br />But if you're in the market for a PSP right now... The PSP 3000 is an ideal step into the PSP World.<br /><br />Also following up the PSP 3000's launch is the Firmware 5.00 which brings Playstation Store (found on PS3) to the PSP.<br />But this firmware will be hitting all iterations of PSP.<br /><br />So...Great purchase for me...Hope all of you here on Amazon do the same :)

A brilliant screen, don't worry about the scan lines.
The first thing I would like to say is that the scan lines are not nearly as big of an issue as others make them out to be. I have only noticed them slightly, and they are completely overlooked when comparing the overall quality of this new screen. It is brighter, has a higher contrast ratio to display more vivid colors, and ghosting is no more. <br /><br />The included games Ratchet and Clank and Echochrome are both terrific in their own respect, but I have to hand it to Echochrome. It is a brilliantly done puzzle game that is as beautifully presented as it is mind-bending.<br /><br />I highly recommend this unit if you have a PS3 because of the remote play capabilities. Being able to stream video, music, and pictures wirelessly is a dream. And now Sony is offering their Media Manager as a free download it is a breeze to add your own music and media right to the 1gb memory stick provided. <br /><br />The best part about owning a PSP is that most games that you really want are now around $20, so you can beef up your library for cheap.<br /><br />All in all I love the PSP 3000, do not let the worries of the scan lines scare you away.

PSP better than 2000
I've had mine now for 4 days.  The pictue quality is much improved.  The screen is quicker and brighter with deeper richer colors.  I have owned every incarnation of the PSP and this is my favorite.  When I played a the 2001 I noticed that fast moving objects caused blurring like many older model LCD display.  The 3001 does not, its always clear and the screen looks fantatasitc now using a wider color gambit than the older models.  I don't have an opinion on the built in mic because I have yet to use it.  But I suppose it's better than not having one.  I'm really impressed with the many improvments sony has made for the PSP software wise as well.  The PSN store is a great improvment also now "remote play" will power on your PS3 via internet or LAN.

3000-- No questions
I originally bought a phat, but when it broke only played my friends 2000. I just bought the three thousand. Not only was it lighter and thinner, but the quality of the sound and the more grainy feel of the face plate totally **changed my gaming experience**! The graininess of the face plate makes for a better grip and also eliminates smudge marks. I would rate this product ten out of five stars**********!

B-day present to myself
When the God of War bundle first came out I've been wanting to get my first PSP. Then, over the summer I heard Sony was releasing a new Ratchet & Clank 3000 bundle, so I bided my time... I'm so glad I waited! I bought it for my birthday recently. I've had no problems getting on to the inter-web, but it's a little clunky navigating for sure. The game is fun, I don't see the scan line problems that has been pointed out... Anyway, if you're like me & considering getting your first PSP; do it.

Great color and picture
I upgraded from the 2000 series and i'm happy I did, I like the feel of this better, also the silver color is nice and the new look is cool. The actual picture is a very big step up, it's like having a portable hd tv almost it's so nice. The picture color was the first thing I noticed, the reds stood out it hit me like a ton of bricks, the darks are DARK! the lights are LIGHT! If you just buy the psp to watch movies you will get your monies worth with the 3000. <br /> There have been talk of the lines in the picture due to the higher refresh rate but I couldn't even see them, then I put it up close to my face and could barely see tiny lines, it makes no difference at all, and you will never notice them unless you actualy try.... hard. I think it is a fantastic purchase, like I said if you need a portable movie player, the picture on this is unbeatable... the iphone or anything can't even touch this. But lets not forget about the games, they are bigger and better in my opinion because of the umd disc that allows for larger games, I reccomend patapon, god of war, crisis core, jean d'arc, ratchet and clank ....   This is a good purchase and would make an excellent gift for anyone who loves games or gadgets.

Great portable game console, MP3 player, video player, etc.
This is a great portable game console which cannot go wrong. Too many pros to list.. i.e., great display, bright, clear; .. and there are enough reviews to cover these.. <br /><br />If I have to pick a con, the internet browser is not impressive. Besides the download speed of the webpage is way too slow. But, this is not the major feature we would use with PSP. <br /><br />5 Star for sure.. By the way, Amazon is super. Delivery was earlier than expected.

Awesome!
This is the coolest thing I've ever purchased on Amazon!<br />The screen is very bright and crisp. It's my first psp so I can't compare it to others, but the anti-glare screen is very very nice. There were no dead pixels and everything was nicely packaged. The shipping by amazon was SO FAST too. I got it 2 days after it came out. Awesome.

So cool!
I had no PSP experience prior to this 3000.  I'm a casual gamer now, although I used to be a hardcore C64 and Nintendo gamer way back when.  I have played a number of different games on the unit without noticing any of the interlacing problems others have been discussing.  Battery life is good - screen brightness is great - being able to surf the internet is great (although the interface is a little cumbersome, its certainly better than nothing).  Everything about the unit just works.  Wifi is easy to set up.  I was up and running in no time and the user interface is very intuitive.  The included game isn't that fun compared to some of the more popular titles out there that I've tried.  The included memory stick is nice.  <br /><br />If you are on the verge - go ahead and splurge.  You won't regret it.

My Grandson Loves it.
I purchased a PSP 3000 Limited Edition Ratchet and Clank Entertainment Pack for my 10 year old grandson for a birthday present. He never puts it down. I found out that his dad loves it too!<br />I am very happy that I made the choice to purchase the perfect gift!!

Bright Oh Yes
the psp 3000 is great dont listen to negative reviews i have the original 1000 model and now the 3000, and no you don't see (Scanlines or anything of that nature), and yes i have played games that have fast moving objects/visuals(Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Street Figter, Crazy Taxi, ect) , and all you see is brighter colors and feel tighter controls. I am a gamer, not an average person who wouldn't know any better, upgrade your unit or wrap it up for someone on christmas time you wont regret it,! So in closings brighter colors, tighter controls and smaller on  the hands = great handheld enjoy!

Don't listen to the naysayers, this is great!
A great way to waste time on a trip, especially if you commute overseas to work.  Also great if you are stuck for 6 weeks at a time in a country where there is nothing to do whatsoever (Saudi Arabia).  I was worried about the reviews concerning the interlacing problems, but not a problem at least with mine.

PSP 3000
My 10yr old son bought this with his b-day money. He loves it. Better then the product is how well Amazon handled us returning the machine because there was a problem with it. I had a new one in 2 days and they aslo give us the new sale price. I was so happy with Amazon and that is exactly why I continue to use them. Thanks for the great job! You made my son very happy!!!!

Extremely good buy
The PSP 3000 Ratchet and Clank Entertainment Pack is awesome.  The PSP graphics and sound quality are very good, and the game is great.  Even if it did not have the movie, I could not think of a single reason not to buy this product.

This worked perfectly and the package contained all that it said.<br /><br />You would need to buy the data cord, case, tv cord etc.

I can't answer this personally because this was a birthday gift for my husband.  I can say that it's the first thing he grabs when he gets home from work.  He even takes it to the restroom!  It looks and sounds very entertaining.  In short, I would have to say that my husband loves it!

PSP 3000 limited edition Ratchet & Clank Pack
It was a gift for my son's birthday, he didn't know what sort of game it was but I liked the pack deal & the idea of limited edition so I bought it for him, it's been a month now & he is still playing this game and loving it (which is amazing) and still crazy about his PSP.  I love the features on this console; it has amazing graphics, very crisp colors and awesome looks and lots of customization options. It is sort of like Sidekick II cell phone which I have used in the past. I had to block the internet access though with my own password and loved that capability.  Over all I am very happy with my purchase & would highly recommend it for all kids of 8 & up.

Wow this is great!!!
I have never owned a PSP and when I saw this deal I had to pick it up and all I can say is WOW! The screen is so bright and the graphics are A+ for a hand held. You can download demos and buy games off the PlayStation network just like on the ps3. The silver color is great looking. I am officially addicted to my PSP now. A+ Sony!

A truly brilliant piece of work
My GF just got me a PSP3000 and it looked so sexy. The graphic is unbelievable. Too many people has complained about the graphic problems, but i have played it for the past week, and there is no problem. I still don't know why people still bad month about this piece of art, maybe jealous i say, But overall, PSP3000 is definitely worth of money.

My son loves this-- and I do too!
My son absolutely loves hand held gaming.  He was hooked with the purchase of his very first gameboy.  Eventually, we upgraded to the nintendo ds lite which was a huge hit with him-- for about 6 months.  Soon after we got the ds lite, he regretted his choice and wanted a PSP. He felt that the available ds game titles were limited, the wifi range, restrictive, and the video graphics... just not good enough.  Knowing that the 3000 was going to be released this fall, I waited and got him the PSP 3000 Ratchet and Clank pack for him for Christmas.  While we don't have any experience with the difference between the 2000 and the 3000, I can say that he absolutely loves it.  It came with 1 game, 1 movie, a memory card, and the charger.  The video on this thing is amazing (digital tv quality).  He enjoys it immensely and I've even got to have a bit of fun with it too!<br /><br />I'm sure with the long list of available game titles and movies, the PSP 3000 will continue to be one of his favorite gaming systems for a long long time.

I love my PSP
I commute into work every morning on the light rail in Portland Oregon.  I bought myself a PSP earlier this past spring with the intension of watching my TiVo on it while I'm on the train.  So every night, I let the TiVo download to my PC and it's kind of like a PSPcasting.<br /><br />All of my Season Pass shows like Lost, My name is Earl, ER, Desperate Housewives, Numbers and all of my favorite shows I don't have time for I'm now watching on my PSP.  I have a 2 gig memory card that is automatically loaded with my tv programs while I'm asleep and when I wake up in the morning I just pick up my PSP from the dock and go.<br /><br />I also play video games on it, its great for that too.  But I'm watching way more TV on it then playing games.<br /><br />With out a doubt this is my favorite toy that I've purchase all year long, although it only half over, I don't think I'll be purchasing anything else that comes close to how much I enjoy this thing.

A thing of beauty is a joy forever
Somebody rightly said "A thing of beauty lasts forever". That holds good for this awesome little piece of technological marvel. <br /><br />The moment you open the box, the widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio) stares at you. The PSP does not come with a game. I immediately rushed to a store to buy a game "Need for speed". The graphics are amazing and the game itself is thrilling. The widescreen adds beauty to the games as the racetracks look more original in widescreen. <br /><br />I have downloaded my home videos shot using Sony HC-42 camcorder. The camcorder shoots in wideangle (16:9). Hence the videos look great on the Sony PSP. <br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The controls on the PSP are bit funny. For example, to accelerate your car you need to press the down arrow and to brake you need to press the up arrow. Isn't that unconventinal? But I got used to it very soon as my race car was not moving at all when all others sped by!!! <br /><br />Sony is known for making proprietary items to mint money. They have created this UMD Disc whereas they could have easily supported mini-DVD instead. Don't spend your money on UMD disks. Instead buy a memory stick with good capacity and download games to the stick rather than using the UMD. <br /><br />PSP is great for viewing photos. But please remember to resize your photos to less than 10% of their original size (if you use a 5 MP or higher camera). This will save valuable space on your memory stick and also display the photos faster on the PSP. If you don't resize them, it takes more than 10 seconds for the system to render the image on screen. <br /><br />Connecting to internet is not fun. The text editor is very hard to use. Please don't have much expectations on this feature. This feature may be useful if you are playing games with another internet partner but not for anything else. <br /><br />Please do buy a screen protector as you don't want to spoil this beatiful screen. Even a minor scratch may show up and spoil the fun. <br /><br />The battery has excellent life (nearly 5 hours) before you need a recharge. <br /><br />Go ahead and buy the PSP. You won't regret the purchase. I would surely recommend this product for you.

199 Buncha Bang for buck
First off, I was in love with my iPod. <br /><br />I really don't think there is a music player -just a music player- that is better than the iPod. And I do not wish this to be an attack on the iPod, because it is NOT. Refer to this later on in the review.... <br /><br />But there is something on the market, that has been deadly silent that has all the ability of an iPod, of course it plays music, plays video, and games. And it not all that much bigger than the biggest iPod out there. What? The PSP does all that? I didn't know that either. <br /><br />Lots of options crammed into this little doo dad. It is also Wireless, Internet ready, headphone jack, USB - there is a button for just about everything. The tiny insides of this little device must be crammed to the brim. Plays Video wonderfully, plays games great. (Loading time is a bit slow, but once loaded no interruptions.... and that is how I would like it, I hate game devices that take time out in the middle of action to catch up... would rather that all be done at the beginning). The movies are a small disk as well as the game disk.... easy to carry around. Small is indeed king here... the device does get a bit heavy after a while, but it OKAY to put it down and come back; but considering how much stuff it does, it should indeed be a tiny bit hefty. <br /><br />Fact is, it is hard to give a good detailed review of this little device since it does so much, and some of the stuff is LITTLE stuff, like being able to save pics off the net, and use them as your wallpaper... it really is a little computer. I have had it a week and have not found anything that I don't like, and I know I have not found all the stuff there. <br /><br />It is very good with a battery. 3 hours on the stock battery and you can play Dungeon Seige 2 with another person. 3 hours playing a game ?? Great stuff. And it recharges fast. Within an hour I had my battery recharged. Plus, you can always just plug it in and play, and ignore the battery. Batteries exist out there, that make it a six hour affair playing games. Music uses a lot less battery. When just playing music, you can get 6 hours of playing music. Headphone jacks can be used in the headphone jack, but you can put all sorts of things into this headphone jack, ... like a really, really small FM transmitter that uses no batteries (this also means no annoying cords)... plus about 30 more things that you can get for this headphone jack to be utilized in total utilization. <br /><br />So, if you wanna shell out about 199 dollars and have a lot more to show for your money than buying a more expensive Video iPod, stop here. Buy this device right now. I no longer use my iPod in my car with an FM transmitter... I use the PSP to do the same thing... and guess what? This device puts out a lot more sound than the iPod. <br /><br />For the cost involved lets break this down: <br /><br />Ipod: <br /><br />1. Video iPod =349 dollars. <br /><br />PSP: <br /><br />1. PSP =199. <br /><br />2. 4 gig memory Chip =85 (on popular auction site, free shipping if you look). (Update, on popular auction site, 4 gig SD duo PSP mem is now 80 dollars, but more importantly, you can get 2 gig ones for $18.99 - just thought the ones who are debating whether or not to get an iPod or a PSP might want this info) <br /><br />What is the outcome? PSP is not only a more capable machine for those looking for a machine that plays music as well as games and video, it is quite cheaper. <br /><br />Why review this in comparison contrast to the iPod? The only reason is, I would have liked to have known about this device before I bought a couple of the iPods I had already bought. THE IPOD IS A wonderful music player. But that is really all it is, and the video iPod does not hold a candle to the video on this machine. <br /><br />Have fun. <br /><br />

Fun! Plus Helps Pass Time...
Being a resident of New York City, there's the daily routine of the long commute to and from work. Some people like to kill time by reading. I am the type that likes excitement. RSS + Games + Videos + Music = PSP !  There are so many things you can do with this. I can download RSS news feeds in the morning and read them while going to work. I can watch news videos or even listen to music. And nothing else can help kill time than games! This is like your own little personal entertainment system!  The graphics are great even for something at this size (4.5 in. diagonal). I highly recommend it.

The PSP is quite amazing.
This portable gaming system is amazing! The screen is so big. The video quality is amazing. Also, not to mention, the graphics for the games are quite cool as well. I also found the Wi-Fi very useful. A lot of restatunts, colleges, book stores, and other places have free Wi-Fi. The game sharing option was a very good idea. Only one person has to have the UMD game disc, and another person in the same room can play against you, without a disc. It just uses the internal memory. I suggest buying a 1GB or 2GB Memory stick. I have a 2GB San Disk memory card, and I have 1 and 1/2 hours of video on there, and there is still about 1GB to spare. So buy this, if you have the $200.00 to spend. All the good, there is one bad part. The battery life. It only last 3-4 1/2 hours. Buy a spare battery. Thats about it....
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Almost Perfect!
I have had this system for 9 months now and it's still working perfectly. So far I own 4 games and 6 UMD movies. This system is perfect because you can listen to music, watch movies, play videogames, look at pictures, go on the internet, watch TV, etc. But for the internet and TV you'll need a 2.5 upgrade which you'll eventually get. <br /><br />As for the games, there aren't many out right now and some I'm not even interested in playing, but I believe (and hope) that later this year there'll be more. The graphics are probably the best I've ever seen on a handheld system and the movies are perfectly clear. On my PSP I have 3 dead pixels but while you're playing or watching a movie, you'll hardly recognize them. <br /><br />As for the cons, this system is easily breakable and I mean if you drop it on concrete floor, it'll most likely break. So be really careful with it. As for the screen, it must be cleaned alot or you'll start seeing scratches which can make it look ugly. <br /><br />Overall, the PSP is worth your money and time and it's a system for everyone. But on second thought, I would rather wait for all the good games to come out and maybe even new colors for the PSP. <br /><br />Hope I was helpful enough!

Very Pleased With My PSP System
If you want a PSP, the core system should be sufficient.  There is a $249 valube pack but the core system is a good purchase for this reason.  The value pack comes with a 32 meg memory stick which isn't much space.  At the same token, you pretty much need a memory stick to do anything with the PSP, so if you purchase the PSP, buy a memory stick at the same time or in the very near future.  I purchased a 1 gig memory disc for around $50.<br /><br />The PSP is very easy to use from the beginning and this is my first handheld system. I will admit I was playing a game (Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories), and the instruction book said use the analog stick and I couldn't find the analog stick.  It's flat on the PSP console, I actually thought it was a speaker.<br /><br />The sound on the PSP is quite good, you can hear quite well even without headphones. However, I will say that you can use any headphones you already have and it will fit in the console, I use the same headphones I use with my iPod.<br /><br />How well you enjoy your PSP depends on what you plan to use it for.  If you want to do the all in one (pictures, movies, games, music, Internet) you may have different feelings or frustrations with various components.<br /><br />I bought my PSP for gaming and I'm very pleased with it.  The PSP comes with a huge instruction booklet that I haven't had to read too in depth yet because if you understand basic computer/gaming operations you can get the PSP up and going.  The screens are nice.  It's a slightly heavy system but seems very durable.

The PSP is awesome~
I know a lot of people knock the PSP, but the fact remains that it's an excellent handheld gaming system with lots of extras. Many of it's 'faults' that others point out here can also be leveled at every other portable gaming device out there, most certainly including the PSP's direct competitor, Nintendo's DS system.<br />Now that Sony has cut the price of new PSP's down to $169, how can you complain?<br />It's the most powerful handheld system ever & there's a bunch of great games out for it now & hundreds more on the way. Many of these games are epic in scale & offer tons of replay value.<br />There's also hundreds of great movies to watch, anytime/anyplace. Many of the games & movies can be had for $10 - $15.<br />The storage problem has been resolved with 4GB memory sticks available,plus you can link your PSP with your PC/laptop & the PS3.<br />The LCD screen is just awesome. Most portable game system's screens suck, but not this one. The audio also pumps (better with headphones) & again blows away what's being offered with other handhelds.<br />It can handle music & surfing the net quite fine too, thanks to recent system updates, although I don't use these features that often.<br />The biggest problem I have with the system is the lack of a second analog stick. Some games would benefit greatly if it had it, but it's hardly a deal breaker; Most games control fine, with the PSP's button setup similar to the PS1/PS2/PS3 controllers we all know & love.<br />All in all, if you want to take handheld gaming to the next level & enjoy console quality gaming on the go,plus the ability to watch DVD quality movies, listening to music, free online gaming & more, the PSP is a great buy.<br />

NICE!!!!!!!!
The PSP is the most advanced handheld gaming system I have so far. The graphics and the games are good.The only problem I have with the thing is the loading time it takes to play games such as Syphon Filter and MidNight Club 3. And by the way,screw who ever gave the PSP 1 star!<br /><br /> P.S Don't drop the PSP! I had to buy another one after breaking my first one by dropping it!

OMG!!!!!!!!
This have to be the greatest system since the iPod first came out. I LOVE MY PSP. I take it with me wherever I go. It's become my constant companion. Whats great about it is, not only can you play games, but with the addition of a larger Memory Stick Duo, you can also use it as an mp3 player, photo viewer, internet connection, and video player! If you thinking about getting a PSP, DONT THINK, GO AND BUY ONE, there great. I suggest getting the core packege, it comes with the PSP system, battery, and AC adaptor, and its cheaper than the value pack which is not really worth buying. Because the only main difference is the value pack comes with a 32mb memory stick and if you want to do more than play game (and trust me you do), you'll need a much bigger memory stick. SO GO AND GET ONE, YOU"LL LOVE IT.<br /><br />Must haves to buy along with your PSP:<br /><br />1. a bigger memory stick, i suggest a 512mb or 1gig memory stick ($50-$70)<br />2. Logitech Hard Case, to protect your PSP ($20)<br />3. USB Chord, for connecting your PSP to your computer. (BTW, PSPs not only work with PCs but Macs with OSX as well) ($10)

Great resolution for movies
The PSP has great screen resolution. We bought it to take on planes with us. The movies look great. The games are fun, too; but we are more the movie demographic...not hardcore gamers.<br /><br />Also, we found the price very reasonable. We also have a video iPod and that was a lot more expensive than this. For people who complained about the price, I am not sure which gadgets they have been buying ;-)<br /><br />Just ordered the wireless adaptor to try out the internet at airports. We like that it has that capability included, too.

Good bare bones PSP.
If you want to get a PSP to use it for media, then this is the best thing to go with.  Why? Because you save fifty bucks!!!  Now that may not sound liike a big deal, but I feel that it's a very good package, and especially if you already have a menory stick (especially if you use Powershot cameras).  And besides, the stuff you get in the value pack is not very impressive.  The only good thing is the hand strap, and you can just get one seperatly (probally say it's a replacement, that would definitly work). The Case is easily destroyed by the logitech case, and the headphones are just crappy earbuds that don't work well.  Headphones, in general, are a whole lot better.  Earbuds also increase risk of hearing loss.  And the lint cloth is worth jack.  And if you want the (and for the record, they still sell value packs, but the entertainment pack is getting more sales) card, get a bigger card, or buy a used 32 MB card for a low price.  I lost my first one, and I got a MB card for only 8 bucks.  And for the demo disc you get, there's nothing but a bunch of weak videos. At least the Petey Pablo music video has hot girls (and he is a terrible "rapper"<br /><br />Basically, get this instead of the value pack.  The entertainment pack is great, no doubt, but if you do not like Atv Offroad fury or Lords Of Dogtown, then just get this.  However, if you do like it and have an iPod (and this cannot replace iPod as far as media.  But it does things that iPod cannot), get this.  Sony was actually thoughtful because they gave us some things to choose from, but the technophobes may be confused by  this. That's okay, and that's where we reviewers come in to help the people we like: the buyers.

PSP : Why this product more than competes with the DS
The PSP has long suffered from similar criticisms along the same lines as those of the PS3. Much of this bashing is groundless. People need to pay closer attention to the horizons of the system. Lets start with the best parts of the system<br /><br />Adaptability: The PSP handles multiple formats of multimedia, including movies, pictures, music, and games, as well as the capacity to access the internet through wifi connection. Using memory sticks, the PSP's access to volume of different files and etc. you can bring with you is only limited by how much you want to carry, and spend on said memory. A 1 gig memory stick is now an average of 30 dollars, which, for me, means I have over 130 songs on my 1g along with the save files for all of my games (over 12 games, with multiple files each) and still have room to put more songs or pictures. Being able to surf the net is somewhat limited, as is a given by a reduced platform to try and process internet content, but it is still nice being able to check my email on the go, or even check on various websites. Also, with the continued upgrades to the PSP's software, you can now access PS3 content through wireless connections. That means that if you have a PS3, you can connect with it almost anywhere in the world, provided you have wireless internet around. Also, with the playstation store on the PS3, you will be able to download old playstation one games, and actually put them on your memory sticks and carry them around. The classics are being made portable and newly accessible, solving one of the problems of those amazing games, their need to be in one place. <br /><br />Hardware and Graphics: The capacity of the PSP to handle games, movies and music is excellent. The sound quality does not suffer despite being a small system, and even then, the support for handling higher quality sound such as Dolby if provided with a good set of headphones or accessories available to enhance sound make it solid. The graphics are superb, displaying movies and images flawlessly, with both widescreen and full screen formatting supported, depending on which version you have in the system at the time. The graphics capacity for games is equal to that of a PS2, with many games a direct port of their console brothers, without losing anything except perhaps the faster loads, and TV connection. There are rarely any hang ups in the images or rendering, and it just looks damn pretty.<br /><br />Games: Here is where the PSP comes into its own. The DS has Nintendo's legendary repertoire, and the PSP has Sony's. Square, Atlus, NIA, and many many other famous companies have shifted gears to approach the PSP with solid titles, adding much more diverse options than what were initially available. The library of the system is solid and packed with good stuff, just look it over and you can find almost any genre represented, from racing, sports, mecha, RPGs, puzzles, etc. When looking over the average rankings of PSP games vs. DS games, the PSP games have far more solid, higher ranking titles, but due to the popularity of the DS, it sells more. The system is still gaining speed. Now, the PSP does not have the stylus or touch screen capacity of the DS, but the wireless/ad hoc play connection is smooth and fully integrated with most new games, making it a breeze to get as many as 20-30 people in some games involved in a single session.<br /><br />Overall System Design : The PSP is a compact, light device, with a large screen and easy to reach buttons. There are a lot of dislike as to the single analog stick and the removal of the second one. At the same time the single analog stick is easy to use in conjunction with the shifting controls of many PSP games, using both the analog stick and directional buttons, without much hassle or stress on the hands. The system fits easily in the hands and doesn't stretch or compress them too much, making it easy for relatively long gaming sessions. The battery is decent, lasting several hours at a time, I've only ever had mine die on me once, and that was after a solid 4 hour run straight. There are also many accessories including double length batteries or extra battery connector/chargers to keep you going even longer without much expense. The system is durable, I've had my fall a few times, and have never seen any issues with the hardware or software. However, I don't suggest actively dropping it, the system is not made of steel, its still a bundle of circuitry and plastics.<br /><br />And now, having covered the pros, the cons.<br /><br />The PSP is still somewhat expensive, and the games, and necessary accessories such as a memory stick, etc. add to the price, but in the end, it should cost very little more than a PS2. By comparison, that is decent,  and to be expected with gaming products of late. They are ALL expensive.<br /><br />Games can be plagued with load times, depending on how compressed the data was on the UMD. Older games are notorious for this, as well as those that are almost direct ports of PS2 titles, such as Spectral Souls. However, newer titles are handling this problem easily, with some titles like Brave Story having virtually none at all, and flowing smoothly between all actions. It simply takes time to handle technology. Also, if you are busy, you can hit the power button and the system will shut off, enabling you to simply hit the power again later and return to the exact spot you were at when you turned it off. Stasis mode.<br /><br />UMD technology does not seem to have the potential to grow into the massive venture Sony had hoped, and most stores don't carry the UMD movies anymore. You are better off downloading/ripping the DVDs you have and transferring them to memory sticks. A 4 gig memory stick can hold up to 4-5 movies on its own, and you can delete and replace the movies at any time. Prepare to shell out around 80 dollars for a 4 gig though.<br /><br />The black skin of the PSP is high gloss, and you WILL see finger oil trails on the buttons and areas around them. This isn't a real con, but it detracts from the aesthetics of the system. Also, the screen, like all handhelds, is prone to scratches, so finding a way to protect it, such as screen shells or flip over covers are important. Unless you like having a scratched screen that is. <br /><br />So, overall, the PSP is a great system. It supports all kinds of media, so you can bring your favorite music, games, and even movies with you for a flight, drive, or for between breaks like I use mine. The fact that you can turn it off at any time and leave the game in stasis until the next time you're ready means that you can easily play a game with lots of action and involvement and simply touch and go whenever you have time. No pressure, no "I can't pause!". The system also continues to evolve through Sony's free updates through the wireless connection, enabling everyone to keep bugs fixed and new features just another download away. This means the system isn't just released and left to the wayside, it is always being given new stuff to work with. The game library is always growing, always improving, with new developers throwing in their ideas to give gamers a solid portable experience. <br /><br />In the end, it really comes down to the target audience. Nintendo has largely shifted its attention to the very young, and the hardcore nintendo fans. Sony has addressed the serious gamers of all ages, providing titles and systems that people of any background can appreciate. The PSP offers a diverse system that can handle vast areas of information and technology, while still remaining a gaming system at the heart and giving just that, a great gaming experience. The DS is oriented towards a few interesting concepts, geared towards the younger group, falling back on titles like Pok e mon and etc, with childish graphics and images, and being very hesitant to have more mature titles. Do you want gimmicks that offer no real future, or a system that will continue to grow with time? The choice is yours. <br /><br />I'm sticking with my PSP. Thanks for reading.

Good job, Sony.
I recently got this for christmas, and it is great. Wireless internet browser works amazingly, and good variety of games. Make sure you get a case! Screen gets scratched up easily, but not big at all.<br /><br />Awesome system!

Great...
Although it may become costly with memory cards and such items, it's a great investment.<br /><br />I would recommend getting a 4GB Memory Stick PRO Duo for max storage (or the 8GB, but that is over the cost of the PSP at the moment).<br />4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo<br /><br />Although, don't plan to make the PSP your main MP3 player because an iPod would be better suited for that reason (and is mainly why I haven't got rid of my iPod nano yet)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPHP4U">Apple 8 GB iPod Nano Black (2nd Generation)</a>. The sound and how music is organized on the PSP isn't that great...plus the PSP is a bit bulky for someone's MP3 Player. If you have a wireless router, iTunes (set for wireless stream), and the program called MyTunesRSS...you can wireless stream music from your iTunes library onto your PSP! I found this feature REAL neat and useful.<br /><br />As a Video player, the PSP is great at doing such thing. Although you may notice the refresh rate could be slow at times, it's still great. Watching movies or TV shows (saved via the Memory Stick) is great for long trips or when you're bored, etc. I do hate how the PSP's video folder structure works though...which takes time to get use to. For video software, I HIGHLY recommend looking into the program called DVDFab Platinum. It does an EXCELLENT job at converting DVD to PSP video files (simple program to use). As well, PSPVideo9 is another software that can convert videos. If you would like to wirelessly stream Video/TV Shows/Movies/Cable channels... onto the PSP (yes, it's possible), I would recommend looking at Sony's LocationFree Player (around $70 on Amazon, super cheap now too).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BGOWIE">Sony LF-PK1 LocationFree Player Pack for PC and PSP</a><br /><br />As a Picture Viewer Player, it's awesome. All your pictures look great on the PSP's screen. There were some pictures that I had that were too dark to view on my LCD monitor (even on high settings) but you could easily see the dark areas of a picture on the PSP's screen. The PSP's screen is big as a 3x5 flash card, which is great, I think.<br /><br />As a Web Broswer Viewer, it's neat but takes time to get use to. Since there's no keyboard, it's hard using the menu keyboard on the PSP. Heavy imaged/video sites will not work on the PSP, but a lot of other sites work fine on it.<br /><br />As a Game Player, the graphics like everyone says...are compared to PS2 graphics. Although, I can't really compare much on gaming on the system yet, since I haven't purchase a game for it yet. Although the PSP's game lineup is promising...plus if you have a PS3, you could purchase and download PS1 games off the PS Store and play the PS1 games on your PS1! PS1 games are around 200-500MBs big, so this is where having a 4GB Memory Stick could get useful.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like to game, watch videos, play music (off the memory card or wireless stream!), using a web browser, viewing pictures sometimes, or have a PS3...I would recommend getting the PSP. <br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VXAM0">Sony PlayStation 3 (60GB)</a><br /><br />***It would be highly recommended that you know some computer lingo (like using wireless stuff, computer programs, formats, etc) and such with the PSP in the long run.***<br /><br />As well, I would highly recommend getting a screen protector too, because the screen WILL get scratch after use. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007XOHYK">Sony PSP Screen Guard Twin Pack</a><br /><br />Other items I would recommend would be a pouch case, PSP headphone+remote (mainly for music playback), GO for a 4GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (if you plan to store movies on it),  and a USB cable if you don't have one already.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KVDNY">Sony PSP Accessory Carrying Case And Cloth</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V46IY">Sony PSP Headphones with Remote Control</a><br />4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009DPQYI">Sony PSP USB Cable</a><br /><br />**A parent recommendation, if you are buying this for your son/daughter...for one, make sure they'll plan to use it (or else, it will be a costly mistake), they will be careful with it (because a drop on the sidewalk will break the PSP in some cases). The PSP, in my opinion, is geared towards teens from 13 and up.

Playstation 2 graphics in the palm of our hand, excellent system
This brings DVD quality video, and playstation two graphics/gaming to the palm of your hands. The price is slowly coming down on these, and now is as good of time as any to buy this system. The title selectin continues to grow (except for the movie selection, dwindling, but still coming), and the games are as child frindly to mature as you want. This also plays mp3's, and easy usb connection to other systems. With a big screen and nicely spaced controls, good playability, it is the leader in the handheld gaming market, one of the few. Worth buying if you travel, or are always on the move and must game on the go.<br /><br />

The Best Portable Gaming device till date !!
<br />Pros: High defintion screen quality and sharpness, Bright screen, Built quality, gorgeous looks, Feature package, keys organised very nicely, Very smooth and amazing game play and video.<br /><br />Cons: Overall Price..<br /><br />Undoubtedly this is the best portable gaming device.. The Maybach of handheld gaming device (Maybach has its price!!)..<br /><br />First thing that you are going to notice and infact go crazy about is the design.. Its sexy, I was simply speechless when i opened the box!! The design is awesome, amazing built quality..<br />When you switch it own you'll feel proud to possess it.. The widescreen of PSP is comparable to the clarity of PS2 when hooked into a plasma.. Its smooth, crystal clear and really bright.. Sony has done an awesome job with the feature set too.. Video playback is very very good and so is the audio.. A lot of features are embedded in to this sexy device. Well you wont be disappointed with the device at all and it'll be one of the best things you'd have ever possessed !! Pick a good game and you'll be pass hours like seconds..<br /><br />Every masterpiece has its own price.. The core system is priced a $199. Well you could just turn it on and turn it off if you buy the core system alone.. Here are the minimum requirements to get started,<br />Memory stick pro duo card(Atleast 1GB recommended) - $59.99<br />Games - $35 per game (Average)<br />Case - $25 (Highly recommended) I bought the Logitech playGear pocket..<br />So now you see the basic requirements are worth a $150 extra.. So we are basically looking at a price of $350 to get started with the PSP.. And if you want extra games or video thats extra of course.. So set you budget before buying..<br /><br />But if cash is not a problem then then i Highly Highly recommend the Sony PSP.. Its gonna be your best friend!!

Here Is An Example of the "Potential" Other Reviews are Carping About!
I got my Sony PSP about two weeks ago to compliment my new 60 GB PS3. I was very excited about the new Remote Play function that will allow me to access all of my music, movies, and photos saved on my PS3 via a wireless connection from anywhere in the world. <br />After I told my friend that I was getting a PSP, he told me that he was able to use homebrew software to run NES, Genesis, and SNES emulators! I did my homework and now I'm playing the classic SNES version of Chrono Trigger on my PSP! I can play Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario, Contra, Metroid, you name it. I'll bet your Nintendo DS can't do that...<br />The Sony PSP boasts, hands down, the nicest screen of ANY hand held device on the market. iPod video? Please... Microsoft Zune? Yeah right. Take a good look at the screen. It's SWEET! Movies on this screen look AWESOME. Yeah, obviously UMD movies are around the same price as DVD's and its a propriety format, but they pump out pretty good quality. I have 3 UMD's of classic movies I would watch on the road. Am I going to buy a lot more? No. But they're nice to have around. Besides, you can download movies onto your Memory Stick Duo...<br />I bought a Sandisk 4 GB Memory Stick Pro Duo for my PSP. That way I could fit music, movies, pictures, games, whatever...Did I mention that you can now play original Playstation games on this machine now too? Right now you need a PS3 to play them, but if you do your homework and get OS 3.03 OE-B installed...then you too can play copies of your PS One library. Final Fantasy VII or Metal Gear Solid on the go anyone? <br />The games for the PSP are getting MUCH better now too. Metal Gear Portable OPS, Tekken Dark Resurrection, and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror really push the system graphically. Most importantly, these games have been designed specifically within the limitations of "portable games". These are not LAZY PS2 ports...In fact, many of the games are no longer ports. A year after launch the games are getting significantly better in my opinion. <br />Yes this system is expensive. But not as expensive as you think. Here's the breakdown of what I got and how much I paid. <br />1) Sony PSP- $150 sale<br />2) 4 GB Memory Stick Duo- $90 sale<br />3) Tekken DR and Syphon Filter- $32 off of eBay<br />4) 200 SNES, NES, and Sega Genesis classics- FREE! <br />5) My old PS One games- FREE! <br />6) Nyko Theater Experience Case- $40<br /><br />I paid 325 for a PSP with 4 GB, 2 great PSP games, a HUGE library of classics to play from, and a hard case with built-in speakers, stand, and 7 hour lithium-ion battery that can charge the PSP. <br />You can do all of this, go online, play wireless with others for free, listen to music, watch videos on the nicest portable screen around, and access data on your PS3 from anywhere (by the end of the year Sony claims). I think it's wicked cool and I think you should agree with me. In the last week I have convinced two of my managers at work to get a PSP. They, like me, are loving every second with it. In fact, I use it more than my PS3 and my Xbox 360 right now. <br />Potential? Ha! There's potential. Go out and unlock some gaming goodness for yourself too! <br />

Worth the money !
Enough good things have been said about this PSP2001 (aka PSP slim and lite)<br />Just to emphasize<br />Pros:<br />- Top notch screen<br />- Playing Madden on this and my xbox felt the same<br />- Extremely easy controls (well built buttons)<br />- Light weight (won't feel the weight when playing for long hours)<br />- Battery hardly used when on sleep mode, I have put this on sleep for days and then continued my game from where I left!<br />- Well designed<br />- Video quality is amazing<br />- Video podcast download over the wireless is a GREAT add-on. I watch CNN highlights on this.<br />- Updating firmware was easier than eating a muffin !<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None that I know of ! <br />- A slight disappointment, if I may, I bought the component cable to connect to my 51" TV. The video quality of the podcasts was unbelievably clear. Now, I knew that the game won't use the entire TV screen (for those who don't know, the game will use about 60-70% of your TV screen). But the quality of the game video was bad, in fact Madden looked terrible on the TV! That is something I did not expect from PSP. <br /><br />All-in-all, money well spent on the console. I recommend this to anyone, any age, who would like have mobility but still be able to play their Madden etc. as well as get bit more out of the console with video podcast downloads over the air or a music player or a 'OK' web browser or location free client or whatever <br /><br />

A Great System
Pros:<br /><br />+A Very Powerful Handheld Device<br />+Plays music, movies, and allows you to look at photos<br />+Browsing online is fun<br />+A lot of accessories available<br />+Now has a good library of games<br />+Easy interface and control<br />+Very detailed screen and large<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Online browsing isn't that much fun<br />-Can't organize a music library and UMDs aren't all that fun to watch, even on road trips<br />-The battery life isn't long lasting<br />-The screen is easily damaged<br /><br />When the original PSP launched back in 2005, it eventually became subjected to heavy criticism.  Not necessarily the console itself, but mostly that much of what it did, people didn't see the use for in a handheld system, and the fact that its library of games wasn't incredible.  Nevertheless, the PSP has still shown itself to be a powerhouse of a console.  <br /><br />First and foremost, this review is not here to talk about the Nintendo DS.  If you would like a review or comparison to the Nintendo DS, I highly suggest you look for reviews under the Nintendo DS or use the forums.  Most people on the amazon community will be very helpful in helping you decide on which handheld is the best for you. <br /><br />The new PSP is much better than the original.  It's slimmer, lighter, and a slightly bigger screen that actually makes some of the picture look a bit more crisp.  Some games also run a little faster, and that more than helps the PSP out.  <br /><br />What the PSP has best been known for (and criticized the most for) is being a handheld entertainment center.  It can do more than just play games.  It can play music, go online, play movies, and you can look at photos.  This is all built into the system and doesn't require you to purchase any extra peripherals to use.  While these are all good and well, they come with slight hitches.  You can't organize a playlist when it comes to the music, and while going online is great, it's pretty sluggish when you have to input addresses and such via a keypad function similar to that of a cell phone.  Movies are great too, but a UMD on the PSP's small screen isn't enough to replace a DVD or Blu-Ray disc.  <br /><br />Luckily, however, the PSP isn't a home entertainment center and is a gaming console.  In that respect it gets the job done.  The Slim PSP works because the interface is very user friendly.  You can select several things from the main menu to do.  Whether it be to play music, browse photos or just start a game.  When playing a game you can return to the home menu at any time.  The system even sleeps if you suddenly have to put it down.  The UMDs are also a great gaming format.  There's plenty of space, which makes some games live up to their potential in length, and also pushes how powerful the PSP is.  In terms of graphics, it's like walking around with a Playstation 2 in your pocket. <br /><br />The PSP does suffer from a couple of setbacks.  The battery is still pretty short in length.  It lasts much longer in the slim PSP than the original, but it still isn't that long lasting.  At least you can always check how much battery is left, and when it gets low it'll let you know.  Even better for the PSP is that even if the battery dies in the middle of a game, you can just charge it and resume right from where you left off since the console will merely go to sleep.<br /><br />The other setback with the PSP is that the screen can be damaged pretty easily.  In order to protect it you'll need to spend more money on accessories such as a case to protect it.  It's also not the most durable system you can buy.  You have to be a bit more delicate with it because it's a bit more fragile than most other consoles out there.  Luckily, most of you probably won't drop it purposefully, but in case a parent is looking at giving it to a child, you may want to watch to make sure they don't drop it on a concrete or hard surface.<br /><br />For a couple of years, the PSP has suffered the most from having a fairly tight library.  Most of its more notable games were either ported from the Playstation 2 or ported TO the Playstation 2.  With the PS2 no longer being the focal point, it has certainly allowed the PSP to grow much more.  We're now seeing much better games and much more expanded games.  The library is still fairly short on fantastic games, but at least now it's growing as a gaming system.  If you're interested in a PSP, now is not a bad time to grab one as there are better games being released and it's been built to last.<br /><br />The PSP is a good handheld device.  With a volley of games to choose from all across the spectrum, the PSP really does serve as a good gaming choice for everyone.

PSP Vs. IPOD for on the road warrior
I was looking for a trip companion since I travel a lot. My options were between an IPOD video (80 gb) and Sony PSP to provide multiple media and entertainment on the go. <br /><br />Pros of PSP over IPOD<br /><br />1) Gaming is great.<br />2) Screen is big enough to watch a movie.<br />3) WiFi browsing is decent for airport/hotel hotspots.<br />4) Doesn't tie you up with any specific media manager.<br /><br />Downsides of PSP over IPOD<br /><br />1) Battery could last longer. I am getting a 4-5 hr. battery life. Good that many planes are coming with 110V power supply.<br />2) No HDD with the unit, but With a 8 GB memory stick is possible to upload all media you need for a trip and if you are always close to your notebook (my case) it's possible to update memory contents.<br />3) Music playback software is very, very basic.<br />4) Unit is bulky. <br /><br />At the end, PSP was the winner mainly for screen size and gaming features. So far (2 weeks) I am very pleased with the product. Some suggested add ons : 8 Gb memory stick (dual pro), hard carring case, soft headsets (did not like sony's original ones).

It's what the PSP should have been to begin with...
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UA0LXQ">PSP 2000 Console - Piano Black</a>- This system has everything that the original PSP system has with added colors for the background, reduced weight, a slimmer design with a changed (for the best) placement for some ports and buttons, more internal memory for faster loading times, redesigned buttons for easier gameplay and a new finish that is harder to smudge and finger-print.  It is the exact same price as the original system but it is essentially so much more.  Worth every penny.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U9TXJ0">PSP Daxter Entertainment Pack - Ice Silver</a> - Exact same as mentioned above, except it is a really cool Ice Silver color.  This is the system that is included with the Daxter/Family Guy/1GB Memory Stick bundle.  It's $199.99, which is cheaper than what just the system and the 1GB memory stick are worth together.  If you don't like either the game and/or the UMD that come with it, then sell them! You still get a kick-balls system and a 1GB memory stick! This is easily the best deal of the three!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UA0LY0">Sony PSP Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron Entertainment Pack - Ceramic White</a> - Same system as the previous two, but it is Ceramic White and comes with a really great Star Wars game.  That's it, though.  No memory stick or UMD movie.  Just Battlefront (would have been better if it were only $179.99 or even $189.99).  If you like Star Wars and need a PSP (especially with that cool-balls Darth Vader helmet picture on the back), this is a no brainer!<br /><br />Choose whichever bundle (or not) suits you best!

PSP 2000 console-Piano Black
I have been reading a lot of reviews for this specific product, and have noticed many people leaving reviews based off of other PsP packages.  This specific package only comes with the PsP 2000 slim console, battery, and wall charger.  There are no headphones, no memory stick, no extra games, movies etc.  Some of the reviews written here may confuse people into thinking that this has some of those extra accessories.  At the very least if you buy this package, make sure to buy a memory stick!  You will need one to save your gamefiles, movies, pictures and music on your PsP.  So now hopefully if you do buy this, you will also be sure to buy all your accessories you need at the same time.  That way you wont have to wait around another week/go out shopping for a memory stick to be able to even use your PsP.

EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A PSP!
Playstation Portable is NOT only for games!!<br /><br />Most people look the other way when they come across anything that has to do with video games. Most people will never touch a PSP, never know what it is really like. Games are only one of the MANY features of a PSP. <br /><br />I bought my PSP about 6 months ago and absolutely love it. I bought it thinking that it would be cool to take on road trips to play games and maybe even watch a movie or two. I now use it for just about everything BUT games. Don't get me wrong, the games are amazing and very fun to play, but it is the "extra" features that make the PSP worth having. I bought a 4GB memory card for mine, about $40, and it was the best decision I ever made. I also paid about $8 for a decent video converter on eBay that lets me transfer ANY DVD video to my PSP to watch later. I now have about 300 pictures, 200 songs, 25 episodes of Seinfeld, one movie, and other videos. The PSP replaced my iPod as well as my PS2 and portable DVD player. I listen to music on it just about every day, and it is great to show off pictures to family and friends. I love watching movies on it, and the gaming is excellent. EVERY person I have shown this off to has wanted to buy one including (but not limited to): my teenage sister, my grandmother, my aunt and uncle, and my mother. It has so many features, it never grows old or gets boring. Sony comes out with updates that can be downloaded directly to the PSP via WIFI, so you are always up to date. The internet browser is awesome, letting you download pictures from Google and pretty much do anything else you would want to on the internet. <br /><br />Overall, I think the PSP is a great gadget that everyone should have. It has so many more features than just video games, it definitely beats any iPod I have owned. The wireless features, slideshows, and videos make it one of my most prized posessions.

30 Year Olds Review
I'm an accountant who as of 2007 has fallen in love with "gadgets". I own 3 iPods, an iFlip video camera, an XBox360, and a Sprint TOUCH cell phone.<br /><br />I bought a PSP just to have a portable video player that would play all my downloaded rap videos and not require headphones at all times. I recommend buying a protective cover for this right away.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Plays movies, videos, music, and games and does so with quality. I was impressed with the sound and videos that were recorded in good quality, played in good quality.<br />-Hooks up to everything. I watch the videos in my car and plug it into the same wire I use to listen to my iPod thru my car stereo. I am able to use the composite wires to hook it up to tv's in hotels when I'm travelling. I can plug it into all my friends stereos thru the headphone jack and DJ house parties and gatherings.<br />-Easy to use. With the media manager I select the songs or videos I want to load and it converts them and puts them in alphabetical order for me in my PSP. My Windows Vista has issues with iTunes but has no problems with the media manager or media player to load songs.<br />-You get bang for your buck. I bought mine on sale for $169.99. I did buy a few add ons with speakers, cover, composite wire and media manager but no item cost over $20. My iPod Touch was $399, my 360 was $399, and my cell phone was $300 so this was a bargain for me and what I'm used to spending on these kind of items.<br /><br />I own only 1 game, Tiger Woods 2008, and only play it for a few minutes here and there but it looks nice and is fun to play. I own 0 UMD movies for it so I can't review that feature. I was a HUGE iPod fan and very loyal to that product but the PSP is #1 today and my favorite gadget right now. I have only owned my PSP 2 weeks but so far no complains or issues after I figured out how to keep it clean.

The Sony PSP 2000 elevates portable gaming to the next level
The PSP 2000 is a little more expensive than the Nintendo DS but its game console capability is only the begining. The Sony PSP is a slick portable gaming system highlighted by an impressive wide-screen display and PS2-like graphics. It also boasts built-in Wi-Fi, a Web browser, and the ability to play music and videos, as well as to store images. <br /><br />This new version appart from being 30% slimer than the original loads games much faster. Another plus is the great variety of games available for any age. <br />

Portable Gaming Wonder
Not long ago I had a decision to make. Did I want to buy an Apple iPod Touch, or a Sony PSP? I only had enough money to buy one, and I was really itching for a new portable entertainment gizmo. After buying the PSP I'm really glad it was what I decided on, but for very different reasons than I expected.<br /><br />First of all, the reason why I decided to go with the PSP was that you simply get more for your money. The screen is bigger, the memory is infinitely expandable (buy as many memory cards as you want), the battery is replaceable, it plays movie discs should you have the desire, it can play MP3s, and it's a full-blown game system to boot. I initially thought I would use it primarily as a video player, and maybe get a game or two on the cheap. Not quite how things turned out.<br /><br />The screen on this baby is indeed beautiful, but it scratches easier than a pair of cheap sunglasses. The digital controls are perfect, but the analog controls are frustrating (bad placement, wacky sensitivity). The system interface on the other hand is a model of great product design, allowing you to do most anything you might want to do quite easily. For instance, during video playback one button press brings up a mini menu and a second button press can adjust aspect ratio (allowing your wide-screen  utube videos to fill the screen with no gaps). The video playback on this device is truly impressive. MP3 playback on the other hand just isn't as intuitive as it would be a full-blown MP3 player like an iPod, so I don't recommend using the device in this way unless it's your absolute only option. The problem with video playback of course is that video takes up way too much space at high quality (I average about 150 megabytes for 20 minutes), and has to be converted to be compatible. So unless you fancy yourself swapping high-capacity memory cards and doing mass-conversions into the wee-early hours of the morning, you aren't going to enjoy trying to watch lots of complete TV shows unless they're around 13 episodes encoded at low-quality.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was quite shocked when I actually started buying games for the system. Most games for the system retail at $30.00 to $40.00 brand new, and can be found used for a ridiculous $10.00 to $15.00. That's on average $10 to $20 cheaper than a DS game used! What this meant to me, is that while I own about 5 DS games that I bought over a period of years, in a matter of a little over a month I bought around 10 games! And these are not underpowered portable games, but full-featured gorgeous console-quality rivaling (or exceeding!) masterpieces like Crisis Core, Daxter, Lumines II, Monster Hunter Freedom, and Ridge Racer! If you are craving more console games like Wipeout and other PSOne and PS2 games, you simply MUST buy this system just for the crazy values! And strangely, there are games that actually BETTER on the PSP than on their full-blown console versions. Lumines, which I had played on the Xbox 360, and Virtua Tennis 3, are both enormously MORE enjoyable on the PSP. Maybe it's just the those games feel when you hold them in your hands, and maybe it's the way the graphics scale down. Maybe it's the great feeling of booting up a game in seconds without turning on your TV. Whatever the reason, there are indeed gaming experiences that are just plain better on the PSP.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten into the PSP scene, I find myself wishing I had a wireless Internet connection, just so I could download some games onto my PSP. I also wish my friends had one so I could enjoy playing some games with them. But even without Internet, the system is an absolutely tremendous value. And now I find myself getting excited for portable games that are coming out, like a portable Gran Turismo, and the next Jak game! If you love PlayStation games or extreme gaming values you need to buy a PSP. Just don't buy one new. You can get a used PSP for a little over a hundred dollars. Now that's a steal!

A must have!
I love it... it's a great gadget to have. In travel, at home...wherever a psp it's great fun. It's definitely worth getting one.<br />It even allows access to your ps3 wherever you are in the world.

Awesome!!!
First of all Amazon is frickin awesome! Second I am really surprised this thing is not killing the DS for sales. I own both a PSP and a DS and with exception that you cannot play mario,link&zelda, pokemon ect on the PSP the PSP is way better than the DS. My love for this thing started when I saw that you can browse the internet with this thing! Also it is very light and the graphics are gorgeous(considering that it is a lightweight handheld).Plus the online gaming is better and easier to use than the online play for the DS, so i give this 5 stars! Enjoy.

simple really
Great psp console, can do a lot of things with it, games,photo,music,videos,internet/wifi,skype,radio...<br />all which is great for traveling!<br />Great selections of games to choose from.<br />Console is also light, it weigh the same as my 30gb ipod.<br />It is a little pricey, considering to get functions like photo,music,videos..etc to work you will need a "Memory Stick Pro Duo"<br /><br />Don't doubt this, if you feel it, just buy it.<br />

PSP 2000
Excellent product, amazing graphics and portability.  With the new (legal) firmware update from Sony you now have the ability to listen to crystal clear internet radio through your PSP with dozens of stations to choose from, I think this is my favorite feature.  New with the PSP 2K (SLIM) is the ability to watch movies and play your music through your television set with a set of AV cables sold separately.  Also with the update, you can play music while viewing a slide show from your photos folder which is pretty neat.  You can also play games through your set if you have a progressive scan TV and a set or RGB cables also sold separately.  Internet browsing is sufficient for light duty surfing and the GUI is fairly intuitive and easy to use.  B/c this console has been out so long there are many aftermarket items for purchase and plenty of used games to be had at half their original price.  I recommend a 4GB memory stick for this as game saves, music, and the ability to save movies on your stick will eat up memory in a hurry.  Loading times are decent and internet connectivity on par with the latest wireless devices.  Only downsides I see is that the surface of this unit is very easy to scratch, but you can buy protectors for that.  Not necessarily a downside, but I'm wondering why in a world of Draft N wireless and quad core processors this unit with it's latest update is still using 802.11b and a 333 mhz processor.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a portable game console that's more of a jack of all trades; Games, Movies, Music, Photos, and Internet, what more could you ask for in something at this price point that fits in the palms of your hands.  Cheers.

Great handheld gaming system, graphics can't be beat.
I still don't understand why anyone would choose the Nintendo Ds or Gameboy Advance over the PSP.  Compared to any of the handhelds, the graphics are phenomenal!!!   Awesome selection of games as well.  I personally really like FPS games like Call of Duty and Socom on this system, and my son enjoys the Star Wars Battlefront, or Burnout. I really think they have the best selection for game titles for handhelds.    This is so GREAT for long road trips or airplane rides.  I love the fact that you can play movies (although it is a very limited library) and your music library on this, as well as surf the web. I have an Ipod as well, but this is much more useful on trips because sometimes you just get bored playing a game and want to switch to a movie/music or vice versa This is my 2nd psp and it gets a lot of use in our house.  If it died tomorrow, I would get another one right away.<br /><br />

A really nice system
9/10/2008<br />I purchased the PSP several months back, and I have to say I really enjoy it.  I can't complain about the number of titles for it...  it has the titles I'm interested in, and that's what counts.  Over all, the graphics and sound are outstanding.  I haven't played with the other features much, but it's nice to know they're there.  My only complaints are small...  The battery life is a bit short (but I usually play at home, so no real bother for me...)  Also, this is a new model, which is smaller than the old.  Unfortunately there are several nice accessories still available for the old PSP, but they won't fit this one.  So it's buyer-beware when shopping for these.<br /><br />Update: 10/2/2009<br />So, I'm still rocking the same PSP, and it's still working like a champ.  Over the past year, I've gotten a little more aware of the capabilities of this little system.  It truly is a powerhouse!  Granted you won't be using it for regular web browsing, the internet capabilities are still quite nice to have.  Mostly for firmware upgrades and downloadable content from the PlayStation Store.  Downloading the games has 2 advantages:  Longer battery life, and fewer things to carry around (an 8GB memory stick holds at least 8 games...)  Sony was even kind enough to start releasing old PS1 games for download.  I'm currently playing through FFVII.  As far as the multimedia capabilities go, I still use my laptop for watching DVDs on the road, and my MP3 player for music.  This system is simply too small to use for movies, and too big to carry around for music.  But, neither of those were reasons for my purchase, so I'm still very happy.

Piano Black PSP 2000 Console
The PSP 2000 is a great console. Its slimmer then the older models such as the PSP 1000. It has a bright LCD screen that works great. The sound quality is great. The graphics are good for the games and other things. The main features are Games, Music, Video, Pictures and the WiFi Internet. It has other features like Internet Radio, RSS Feeds and Skype. There are other features on the system like security, colors for your background, putting on wallpapers, and the music visual player. Its easy to update your console. Soem games come with updates too. The only con for this is that is doesn't include a USB cable. I'd recomend getting a case for protection, a memory card, and headphones. You might also consier a PSP Media Manager if you want to put music on you PSP. Other then that, this is a great handheld system.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Simply the Best
When I got the new PSP Slim, I knew I'd be getting a powerful gaming device and media player. But within minutes I learned that I was getting much more.<br />The first thing that you notice about the PSP is the high quality games. There are many great titles in all genres, and with PS2 level graphics, who couldn't find a game for them. What's more then that, with the new cache mode, the slim doesn't have to trade beautiful games for sluggish loading times.<br />Another function of the PSP is the music player. I'm not the type of person who listens to musicevery waking moment, but if I ever get tired of games (which isn't very often) the music player delivers. There is no way to give more then one layer to any playlist, so an Ipod or Zune is a better choice for music junkies, but for a bit of music between games, the PSP is more then adequit.<br />Under the network tab are many varied programs. From Skype to radio to a full blown internet browser. The browser may be slow and the skype admittedly useles, but these features can come in extremly handy. The internet browser has bookmarks and a homepage, so google can be used at hotspots without a laptop.<br />The final feature that I come to is the video. Whether you are just storing your favorite videos or useing it to watch the news, the video is very helpful. The video is best pared with the RSS (found under the network tab) which can download video automaticly. News sites like CNN offer news feeds that can keep you updated away from a computer or TV.<br />Overall, the PSP is the ultimate portable game system, not only beacause of it's high quality games, but everything else that a good portable divice needs. Game saves don't take up too much space, but to get the most out of your PSP, I'd reccomend a four or eight gigabyte memory stick. The PSP has given me hours of entertainment and is suprisingly durable. All of these features and advantages have made the PSP my most valued possesion and favorite toy. I know that anyone without a bias opinion would tell you the same thing.

Slim PSP
This PSP is lighter and loads a bit faster than the previous version. It smudges just as easy, now the back has the same finish as the front. If you have any problems with your current PSP, you should definitely get this one!

So glad I made the switch
I sold my older "fat" psp back in June, and missed it miserably over the summer.<br />Months later the black psp slim finally appeared on amazon,<br />I pre-ordered as soon as i could. It was sure worth the wait!<br /><br />I love this new psp, far more than the previous one.<br />It is drastically lighter, and does definitely feel slimmer in my pocket.<br />I love how the back is shiny now. The new positions of the speakers and memory cards, and wifi switch are actually better.<br />I also got the component cable, it works fine, except for the game black borders, but really, I won't be using it to connect to the TV, i just like  knowing i can if i really want to.<br /><br />I bought the psp the day it came out, and have loved it since,<br />its great to see a stellar system only get better.<br />Overall, i would recommend this psp to anyone.<br /><br />IMO the silver one looks cheap. classic piano black, ftw.<br /><br />take care.<br /><br />

Almost flawless adaptation of the Resistance series on PSP
I picked up this game on release day 2 days ago. I'vd played the single player campaign, as well as the online muptiplayer, so i'll comment on both. <br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER:<br />So far, the campaign as absolutely awesome! Story-wise, it takes place between Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2. You play an ex-soldier came across his brother in a conversion center, and was forced to kill him before he converted to Chimera. All of this is explained to you in the Resistance: Fall of Man fashion. There is the same woman narrating (alot of people did not like how R2 scrapped this). The story is very well told to you, and really gets you involved.<br />GAMEPLAY/CONTROLS<br />Sony Bend did the best they could with the controls, especially for an over-the-shoulder 3rd person shooter. First, i absolutely love the aim-assist function. The PSP isn't the easiest system for aiming since it lacks a second joystick, so in Retribution you have a wide yellow box, any time an enemy is in the box it will automatically aim at them. (you can turn this off in the options to make it more difficult) Second, the cover system is actually pretty cool. Its a Gears of War style of taking cover minus having to hit a button every time: if you walk up to a wall you will automatically take cover, if you pull the trigger you pop out and start shooting, let go of the trigger and you go back into cover. As for guns, there are alot :) Lots of old ones from R1 and R2, as well as a couple new ones. <br />ONLINE:<br />This is one of, if not the best, games for online play on the PSP. It is Resistance: Fall of Man sized down for the PSP. You have death match, ffa, team death match, etc., with up to 8 players (4 on 4). You can chose ranked or non ranked matches as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably one of the best games out for the PSP, both for single and multiplayer. Its about time a developer came out with something like this, nothing has been close since God of War. DEFINITELY worth 40 bucks. Go out and buy!

A must have for Resistance and shooter fans alike!!!
I am a big fan of shooters and love my PSP, but have found very few decent portable games in this genre.  I took a chance on this game because it was produced by the same guys that made the "Syphon Filter" PSP games (If you are not familiar with them they are very well reviewed, wonderful games.)  I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />This game is fantastic.  I will briefly list the pros and cons.<br /><br />The Pros:  <br /><br />1)  You can carry more than two weapons again.  One of the things that made Resistance: The Fall of Man so good was the plethora of unique weapons always at your fingertips.  Resistance: Retribution reintroduces this feature.  The player is able to carry up to 12 weapons each with an alternate fire option giving you much creative freedom is solving the challenges that the levels through at you.<br /><br />2)  The controls are well thought out and easily customizable.  They work very well in the default configuration<br /><br />3)  The story is easy to follow and compelling.<br /><br />4)  The graphics are cutting edge for a portable game.  They are stunning and really have to be seen to be appreciated.  <br /><br />5) There are "Skill Points" and "Intel" documents to collect on each level which allow you to unlock new weapons and additional features.  Re-playability is very high for this reason.<br /><br />6)  "Infected mode" is an added value for owners of Resistance 2.<br /><br />7)  The "infrastructure" multiplayer feature allows you to connect wirelessly (via the internet) with players all around the world for what is arguably the best multiplayer experience on any handheld to date.<br /><br />8)  Resistance: Retribution "Plus" mode allows you to use a PS3 controller for PSP.<br /><br />9) The difficulty scales well.  I have not been overly frustrated with any part of this game.<br /><br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />1)  The only thing that I would like to see improved is that in "Plus" mode, you PSP is tethered to your PS3 through the USB cable.  I don't know if it is technically possible to do it any other way, but it certainly limits the portability of your PSP.<br />Conclusion:  At the end of the day, Resistance: Retribution will be remembered as one of the games that defined this generation of handheld games.  Any fan of the Resistance series, or of this genre for that matter, would be remiss in not picking this one up.  It is an absolute must have.<br />

Resistance:  Retribution
Resistance Retribution is a great game to come to the PSP.  The graphics are almost as good as God of War Chains of Olympus except some character animations look a little blocky. The cutscenes look crisp and clear on the PSP's LCD screen.  Even though there is one analog stick the controls are easy to use.  There is an automatic lock-on when an enemy comes into view.  Or you can manually aim which is a little tougher.  Even though I've never played Resistance Fall of Man or Resistance 2 because I don't have a PS3, this game turned out really good and I would strongly recommend this to anyone.  Its rated M for blood and gore, partial nudity, strong language, suggestive themes, and violence.

Resistance... simply amazing.
Best way to sum up Resistance: Retribution... simply amazing. It's my first Resistance game, but the gameplay is intense. Amazing graphics (PSP games should all be this good), great plot (really involves you), and very good controls (third person shooters, take a note!). I've only had the game a week, but have hardly been able to put it down. Definitely one of my favorite games now. My only issue is that there isn't a "save" option in the middle of a level which can get on your nerves if you're only able to play about 5mins or so. However, I'll overlook the save bit since I love the rest of the game. Even the unlockables are pretty fun. Finding intel definitely gives the game some replay value as well as the Infected and Plus modes. Overall, this game is a must have for anyone that enjoyed Resistance, third person shooters or just wants a fun action game. I give it 5 stars... I'd give it 6 stars if that was an option!

Just plain awesome; one of the best games on the PSP
Sony's Resistance franchise is one of the best reasons to own a PS3, and when it was announced that it would be hitting the PSP in some form, saying there was some hesitation about it was saying it lightly.  However, Resistance: Retribution for the PSP is a just plain awesome game that shows what the PSP can be capable of, and ends up being one of the best games available for Sony's maligned handheld.  Playing as British soldier James Grayson, you take on the invading Chimera once again, this time using a third-person perspective.  Regardless of the change in gameplay perspective, the fast and intense style of the series remains intact, and as fun as you'd expect as well.  The game looks fantastic for a PSP game as well, and the single-player campaign is challenging, but the real meat and potatoes of Resistance: Retribution lies in its absolutely sick online multiplayer modes, which never stop entertaining.  The game also features the ability to link up with Resistance 2 on the PS3, which allows you to "infect" your PSP to give James the abilities of Nathan Hale and more besides.  The game's few flaws, namely its occasional shoddy voice work and getting used to its controls, are really nothing much to worry about, as the game winds up being a must play for PSP owners.  All in all, Resistance: Retribution is just plain awesome, and is by and far one of the absolute best games to hit the PSP yet.

Awesome game!!!!!
This is by far the greatest game out there for the PSP. It reminded of the joy I had the first computer game I ever played- Doom. It's just plain fun with a great background story and lots of things to kill. I played the whole game in Normal mode and while it's definitely hard in parts, and frustratingly difficult toward the end of the game, it can be completed which is always great. I was also pleasantly surprised with how long the game was- it just kept going and going. Truly a magnificent game.

Best Video Game I've Ever Owned
I'm not much of a gamer but I like to play the PSP when I'm watching TV.  I bought this game because of all of the reviews and without a doubt it was the best game I've ever played.  It was real hard and took me forever to finish.  It had a tons of levels and they were all challenging. It's a great game and it was totally worth the money.

way too cool to miss out for the the psp
this game is one of the best 3rd person shooters I have ever seen.  for those that like free look multiplayer without all that sticky crap, welcome to heaven!!!  It is like Halo for the psp, minus jumping, but when was that ever able to cross into the psp world??  total a good game for the young adult and adult players; good stuff.  <br /><br />one thing that kinda makes me sad is that some of these games could have stayed on the shelves longer if they had a free play mode like in battlefield with command posts, but that is never bound to happen, they just don't know how to improve on this goodness because they never want to try:  its portable:  how many honest people actually play it comparitively to people who play Xbox 360, or PS3??

Fun shooter for PSP
I normal hate the shooters on the PSP that use the buttons to look around but by them putting the bracket their to assist you with aiming has helped this game alot.  Its well made, voice acting is good with a descent storyline.  I'm not finished playing it to the end yet but it has been a good enjoyable experience so far.

Same engine as Syphon Filter
It's just like Syphon Filter, and the online multiplayer is identical.  Good news if you liked Syphon Filter, there is no learning curve and you can instantly do well in the game and online.  Kind of lame if you are looking for something new, but still fun.

Resistance:Retribution PSP
This is the first real game I've ever played. I only own a PSP for games. Resistance was the third attempt at trying to play games for fun. Tried a driving game and a Tom Clancy game; both were OK but too boring for what I was looking for. At my level this game is worth playing through more than once. I'm middle-aged with a 9-5 job so it took a few weeks to get through the game :)<br /><br />The storyline is well above average; the cutaways also. I really cared about the protagonist. The story would make a fun short if stitched together.<br /><br />It was a ride to get through. I always looked forward to picking it up and playing more. The music is good and coherent throughout; no cheeze.<br /><br />I hope I'm not spoiling anything but the end gives a hint that a sequel is possible. Not that there isn't closure in the end; it's in the narrative of one of the cutaway scenes towards the end that reveal a possible part 2.<br /><br />I've seen the series on the PS2/3 systems on youtube and the PSP doesn't compare, that's true. But, for those who know and understand the "simplified" graphics and interface that goes into games for the PSP, it should cause no dismay.<br /><br />In the end, if I lost my copy, I'd replace it new. Best of luck to all.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Totally ROCKS!!!
<br />I LOVE this game!!! One of the few games that even after several playings doesn't get boring. I started it on the easy level and am now trying to get through it on "normal" which is still hard as heck. <br /><br />It is bloody and probably not for the kiddies but still lots of fun and killings things is always a good way to work out stress right?<br /><br />D

Impressive
This is an extremely well thought out game.  The graphics and gameplay are excellent- I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.  Because of the auto-aim capability I do find it easier to play than Resistance Fall of Man, but given the lack of high-fidelity controls on the PSP, it's a tradeoff which works well.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Awesome single player campaign
With the journals and the narration by Rachel Parker, the game's main character is more accessible than Nathan Hale. I felt that I learned more about his character in the Resistance novel than either Resistance 1 or 2. R2 did some characterization but not enough. The campaign also is well varied, challenging and fun. There are few new weapons, but some old ones have twists. The razor is a nice psp spin on the bullseye. It has a charge attack that ricochets off walls. It's pretty cool, and it needed to be to replace the bullseye. The mech battles are nicely distributed. I think the use of hags also really mixed it up. I hated those things, but they require good aiming (or a powerful blast, which wastes good firepower). All in all I can't recommend this game more. On a technical aspect, it is not God of War, but its gameplay and story are arguably the best on the system if not the best.

Great game
Quite simply, one of the most fun games for the PSP.  The controls are simple to pick up and easy to learn and the action is fast and fun.

Does Exactly What You Need It To Do
When I ordered this on Amazon, I was hoping that it wouldn't be some sloppy redesign of the original PSP case. Well I am happy to say that this case lives up to the quality that was present in other Logitech cases from the other generations. <br /><br />All of the ports have ample access room, except for the USB port on the top that requires for the PSP to be removed. Hard plastic covers the PSP from head to toe and the rubber fitment in the case cradles the PSP with no wiggle room. Logitech also sends out stencils with the case, allowing you to slip in any piece of artwork that you desire so that it is visible from the outside. The hinges are strong and they will hold the cover at whatever angle you like. When the cover is opened all the way, it acts as a stand that lets your PSP stand at a 45% angle that is good for displaying the console. The bottom of the case is also a neat little feature that exposes the "PSP" logo ring on the back of the PSP. Since I have the God of War: Red PSP, the combination of black and red go really well together.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great PSP case that not only protects the PSP, but makes sure that all of your essentials are accommodated. You could definitely take this on the road with you without hesitation and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest in the protection of their PSP.

I like this case!
Ok, so I just got a PSP3000 and needed some good protection. I am an adult with medium size men's hands, and, although I like that the PSP is small, I find it's almost too small for playing pleasure. In fact, when I first got the PSP3000, I was jammin' to God of War, side-steppin' and slashin' baddies with Kratos' blades when the PSP almost flipped out of my hands! Because the PSP Slim (2000 or 3000) has such a small form factor, if you have medium to large hands, you should definitely consider getting the Logitech case. The  case is a clam shell design that fully protects the PSP from front to back and allows access for you to play the PSP while it rests within the case, therefore giving it a little more bulk for those of us adult PSP users. The upper part of the clam shell also folds back and doubles as a stand if you want to set your PSP on a table to play. Also, the case includes a template that you can use to cut out pictures, illustrations or just about anything you want and use as "wallpaper" inside the case. I'm a grown man and I didn't think I'd ever avail myself of this little feature, but lo and behold I've now got a nice little human skull illustration on my Logitech case that I downloaded for free from the Playgear Pocket Skins website. Lastly, the Logitech case is also very, very reasonably priced. That's my two cents. . .

Best PSP Case
The PSP Phat Logitech Case was made awhile back and it did not fit the Slim PSP. Logitech has answered our calls and made a slim version on the case. Overall, the case is great. The psp fits snuggly in the case and provides great protection. The cover also flips 270 degrees so you can use it as a stand. All buttons can be accessed and the case locks shut, so the case won't open unexpectedly. The memory card slot and the USB connection will be blocked, so you will have to take out the PSP to access those areas. If you have an extended battery, you can also use this case. The best part about this product is the able to customize it with your very own image. You can place the images on the back of the case between the rubber and the case outside. They will provide you with a template to use so you can print out your own creations. I personally recommend using an ex-acto knife to cut out the images. Lastly, your PSP can nest itself inside the case and can be used as a grip..it works really well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Great Protection (Inside + Outside)<br />+Small Enough To Be Taken Anywhere<br />+Customize Images<br />+Buttons are All Accessible (Expect for the WLAN Switch/Memory Stick/USB)<br />+Can Be Used as a Stand<br />+PSP Can Nest Inside and Be Used as a Grip<br />+Looks Very Nice<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Template That Comes Inside Package Isn't 100% Accurate<br /><br /><br />There aren't many cons out there to deal with this product. If you need the convenience and protection, I would highly recommend getting this product!<br />

PSP Logitech PlayGear Pocket Slim
Since I bought my PSP-Slim in June, I was using the Sony PSP Slim case.  This case was bulky and it defeated the purpose of owning a Slim PSP.  I just received the Logitech PlayGear Pocket Slim today and it's great.  The PSP fits well.  The case "hugs" the PSP so that it doesn't rattle or move around at all.  All the necessary holes are there for the headphone/remote jack and power adapter connection.  The PSP is easily playable while still in the case.  I highly recommend this case for any PSP-2000 owners.

Great Case for the PSP Slim
The slim psp fits this perfectly. I have no problem playing games while the case is still on. The plastic and padding seem like it will protect the psp well. The case doesn't pick up finger prints.  The only bad part is it will add some size to the psp. This will be a problem it were going to carry it in your pocket. I always keep my psp in a bookbag so that isn't a problem for me. One last thing, all the ports are easy to get at

Perfection
This case is engineered to perfection.<br /><br />It's comfortable, lightweight, unobtrusive, goregous - in fact, I think the PSP looks BETTER with the case on than off, the top half can be used to block the sun and let you view the screen, the PSP logo fits snugly in the back, the case closes and stays shut with a satisfying click, and all of the ports can easily be accessed (except for the Wifi and USB on the PSP3000). As an added bonus (as many others have said before me) you can use the top half to stand the PSP up to view movies comfortably (will probably be useful on a plane, although I'm not much about watching movies on the PSP --- yet.)<br /><br />Simply put, this is THE best case for the PSP. It improves the ergonomics, it makes it feel -- more expensive, and while using it, you actually feel as it performs somehow FASTER with the case (although I know this is all mental).<br /><br />This case combined with a screen protector is an absolutely solid choice.<br /><br />Don't even think twice, get it, if you have a PSP2000 or PSP3000. You won't regret it.

Completes the PSP
I love the PSP and its huge screen, but it immediately raised concerns because it was unprotected.  My bundle had nothing to really carry it in, and I didn't want a case that would force me to remove the unit to play.  This was the best option, and frankly, I couldn't be happier.  Now I can just close it up and leave it out.  It can even charge while its closed.  It's even survived a couple feet drop, on to carpet mind you, but I wouldn't want to take that risk without this case.  On top of this, it's form fitting, holds the PSP snugly, looks great AND increases the mass of the system, which is a good thing for a man with slightly larger hands like me.  For me, it completes the PSP.

like it
Its a good case, very strong and offers good protection.<br />I used to throw my psp in my backpack naked, it get scratch up a lot.<br />Now I throw my psp in my backpack with a case on it. <br />Now the books and other stuff in my backpack won't crush or scratch my psp.<br />Genius!

Good PSP 3000 protection, no extra storage
The PlayGear Pocket provides good protection for the PSP.<br /><br />- A PSP 3000 fits tightly in the case. There is no room for it to wiggle while on the road.<br />- The hard, clear plastic exterior appears to be strong enough not to crack or disintegrate if stepped on or dropped.<br />- The soft, rubbery black interior will cushion most shocks and will protect the PSP from scratches.<br />- A template is provided to allow for cutting pictures that could be inserted between the lid's rubbery liner and the transparent lid.<br />- All connectors other than the USB can be accessed while the PSP is in the case and the case is closed.<br />- All controls can be accessed while the PSP is in the case and the case is open.<br />- The PSP needs to go out of the case to replace the UMB disc, the memory card or the battery.<br />- There is zero room for storing anything. The power adapter, UMB discs, wires, etc. will have to find some other storage facility.<br /><br />I am pleased with the PlayGear Pocket because it does not compromise safety for the extra convenience of storing a couple of small extras. It does what one expects off it - protect the PSP.

Good Case
This is one of the best cases for your PSP.  Although it adds some bulk for the PSP, it does offer protection.  I would recommend this to any PSP owner.

Own a PSP 3000?  This is THE Case to buy!
If you own a PSP 3000 this is THE case to buy.  It's stylish, sturdy, functional, and gets the job done.  All the important PSP controls are accessible, even with the case closed.  It's easy to remove the PSP 3000 from the case and it fits in the case snugly.<br /><br />Drop your new baby on the ground with this case protecting it and you won't have a scratch on the PSP. It is built to last and protects your investment very well indeed.<br /><br />This excellent case even opens into a stand to watch movies, listen to music, or play games with the PSP in an upright position facing the viewer.  It's plain to see that a lot of thought and design work went into this case, which is an absolute steal at around $12.  Highly recommend you look no further for your PSP 3000 case. This is the one to buy.

Must Have Case
If you are like me and bought the PSP as a gift for your child, then I highly recommend this case.<br /><br />It's very sturdy and has a nice look and feel. Whats more you can customize it with your own printed graphics, just Yahoo! 'logitech playgear skin' and you'll get many sites that will let you download skins for free.<br /><br />Best thing with this case is that kids don't need to take the PSP out of the case to play. Only time u need to take it out of the case is when you want to use the USB cable or change the memory stick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case.

Great protection, amazing price!
This PSP protector case is absolutely awesome. I couldn't believe the price for the quality of the case! The PSP fits snugly inside, and i have dropped it once on concrete with the PSP in it, with absolutely no damage to the Playstation Portable. you can use the psp while it's in the case which i find to be a major bonus. All around good buy.<br />

Excellent Protection
I was looking to keep my PSP protected in something a little more substantial than a felt bag, and this case fills that role beautifully.<br /><br />So far I've dropped it, had things fall on it, kept it in my cluttered backpack, and let it absorb all the day to day sitting and sliding around on rough surfaces.  The case shows that wear and tear pretty evidently as it seems to mark up easily, but the PSP inside still looks like the day it came off the line.  The case itself is holding up well structurally; no little bits breaking off or hinges snapping yet, and I've had it for awhile now.  <br /><br />It's a little too chunky to put in your pocket and the latch is a little wonky at first, but those are minor gripes considering the extra protection.<br /><br />If you're looking for substantial protection for your handheld, I recommend this case.

Best Quality! Best Choice! Gotta Get It!
I kept going between this one and the official PSP version, and ended up getting both to try it out. They both are built with quality, but I have to favor this one over the other more bulky one. Don't get this one mixed up with the other one because this one will not hold UMDs or memory cards. But since I already have cases for those, this one is the winner. It is less bulky, and because of this, fits better in my pockets which is great when traveling. The other case with storage wouldn't fit at all.<br /><br />This one has a great feel while playing, and offers superior protection with its snug fitted enclosure. It allows access to everything you need! So if you're looking for a great case without the bulk, this is the way to go!

I never take my PSP out of this case!!!!
Unless I need to change the game or connect the usb cable, my psp stays in this case at all times. I really like the snug fits this case has on the psp without being extremely tight. The psp is 100% playable while in this case and you can also charge it without removing it. It is a really good quality case and since I have large hands I think it also makes the psp a little more comfortable for me to play for extended periods of time. With this case and a screen protector, you should have no problem keeping your psp in new condition for a really long time.

A very sturdy, very well made case.
I use this case to protect a PSP-3000.  The PSP fits very snugly into the case, which I find reassuring.  All buttons are accesible while the PSP is inside, as well as the AC in for charging.  My favorite feature, which I hadn't seen mentioned, is that the cover flips back 270 degrees.  This allows you to prop up your PSP in it's own stand for watching video or listening to music/podcasts.  Very, very useful.  <br /><br />You obviously won't be able to bring any extra games with you using this case, but you already knew that, right?<br /><br />A great case at a steal of a price.  Protect that screen!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
No Regrets!
Solid protection for your psp. It has a nice snug fit with a hard rubber interior that will not scratch the psp but keep it from moving. The case has openings for the power-cord, power switch, headphones, & the L & R buttons. Just know that you will have to remove the psp slightly from the case in order to use the usb cable slot or the WLAN button, - no openings for them! That's a minor flaw, if anything, omitting the openings just makes the back of the case that much stronger! A good investment for the protection & the price, I have no regrets.

Good case - Especially Reccomended for older PSP-2000 owners
As an older male gamer, and by old I mean older then 21 years, I love the PSP - 2000 for its more responsive buttons and extra ram as well as the excellent homebrew community...but I always had a problem with it's size. My hands are too large and often feal cramped when I played for too long, and my thumbs over reached onto the screen due to being too long. <br /><br />The PSP Logitech PlayGear Pocket - Slim case you see here fixed this problem. It made my PSP just big enough so my hands fit the PSP console perfectly. The case leaves room open to plug in headphones and a charger if you need it. In addition, its a great durable case. I've accidentally dropped it on the road out of my Truck a couple times and it survived both impacts with neither scratches to the case or damage to my PSP.<br />The only downside is that you must take it out of the case to access the USB port, switch memory sticks, or switch UMD's<br /> <br />The ability to put your own pictures on the sides of the case it is also a great plus that can give your PSP some personality other cases won't. There are a lot of skins for this that can be found and downloaded online, or you can print your own out. <br /><br />Overall, great product.<br /><br />

Best protection for PSP3000
This logitech Slim case fits my PSP3000 black model perfectly. It does add bulky size to the PSP, but it offers a better grip, and can be used as a stand when eatching movies, though it will slip to the surface if you put on a not so horizontal table. Overall, it's the best protection you can find on the market for PSP3000, as well as PSP2000. A little thing to mention, this is the "Slim" one, instead of the bulky one for the PSP1000.

Great PSP Case
This is a very sturdy protective case for your psp and it fits snug into this case.<br /><br />Some people may find some problems with the case; it doesn't allow you to open the UMD drive while in the case, there is no access to the usb port or the wifi switch.<br /><br />But if you don't switch umd's alot, don't connect to your pc often, and leave the wifi switch on and set power saver option for the wifi inside of the psp there should be no problem.

Great value
I think this case is very sturdy and serves it's purpose well. <br />I haven't dropped my PSP nor am I planning to, but just by looking at all the little scratches this protector has I sure am happy I bought it :)<br />The PSP 2000 fits great and you can play just fine with the unit inside the case.<br /><br />

13' Macbook Pro
i just picked one of these up and I love it.  I have read reviews complaining that Apple did not try to  cram an i5 or larger CPU into this 13 inch machine.  True, the chose to use the Core 2 Duo but that's not all bad.  This is a stable, cool running, capable processor.  The machine now includes 4 G of ram and a much improved video card from the previous version.  I use this mostly for work where stability, battery life, portability, and longevity are the most important things to me.  I rarely play games.  I wouldn't use a portable for video work when I have a desktop available.  I run office applications, safari, email, ever note, and skype.  It all works great.  The machine feels substantial in my hands.  Pick it up and try to twist it.  It is perfectly rigid.  My Toshiba feels like the battery would fall out if I twisted a bit more.  This one feels well built.  I especially like the backlit keyboard.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Another great machine from Apple
This is my umpteenth Mac and as usual, it's a very satisfying purchase. Although the styling of this laptop, with the dark hinge and keyboard isn't quite my cup of tea (and is a matter of taste), this machine is far and away the most solidly built. It feels like it could stop a bullet, and it probably could. It's reassuring rigidity gives it a feeling of quality and sturdiness second to none. For someone who man handles his laptop all day every day, this is very important.<br /><br />To be seen over the next months and years is if the reliability of the machine is as good as its build quality.<br /><br />One final, off-topic note on delivery: Amazon service has been excellent. Yes, their systems are not perfect, but their customer service has made up for it. I originally got an inexplicable delivery date, but a call fixed that.

Went Mac and NEVER going back...
I never write reviews. NEVER. But this is something that just has to be reviewed because everyone should have one of these. It's a little long but I feel that this has to be said. If I can't convince you, go to the store and mess around with one if you'd like. Better yet, read all the reviews. They all can't be wrong.<br /><br />I've been a windows user for all my life. The experience has been great all the way through XP. With all the negativity surrounding Vista, I decided not to persue it. I've had relatively little problems with windows honestly except dealing with all the problems I deal with on a daily basis (Help Desk Tech). If there's anything that I feel like touching least when I come home, it was my XP machine.<br /><br />Why did I go Mac? I've seen the hundreds of things that can go wrong with Windows. I've heard all the complaints about Vista. Haven't played much with 7 but just messing around with it @ Best Buy I thought, "Yea maybe it's better than Vista but it's pretty much the SAME OLD WINDOWS when it comes down to it." I'm deploying soon and I had a 17" Dell Inspirion 1705 Windows XP machine (See how long that is? I am happy to say that when someone asks me what I'm rollin with, I reply, "13-inch MacBook Pro" A lot shorter but that's besides the point). Anyways, the screen is HUGE and there was no way I'm taking that tank with me over there. WAY to heavy and WAY to bulky! So I was in the market for a Laptop that was at most 14". When it comes to electronics, I research a ton.<br /><br />What was the first thing I typed up when I was looking for a new PC?<br /><br />"What is the best brand of laptops (Windows)?"<br /><br />Yea that didn't help any. I got "HP is the best!" Then I got "HP is the worse!" So it was a lot of mixed reviews for mostly all of them. So I thought that I'd venture into Mac since I've never owned one. Went to the site and it gave me 2 options: Macbook and Macbook Pro. I opted for the Macbook Pro because 1) I wanted 4GB of RAM (I read it just works better all around) and 2) I wanted an SD slot. There are other reasons why Macbook Pro is nicer but I'll get into that later.<br /><br />What was my only doubt before buying Mac? What if I need Office? Well there's bootcamp. I'll tell you what, so far I've had no use for Windows yet (waiting to see how Office for Mac 2011 is before I decide). So I did it and let me tell you, I've never had more fun messing with a computer than I've had with my Mac. Ok enough ranting, what do I like? What don't I like?<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Great design- A reason to get Macbook Pro over Macbook: the construction. All PCs=Plastic<br /><br />+OS is so easy- Navigating through my files couldn't be easier. No more "Well that file is in c:\windows\localprofile\temp\settings\...ETC" It's all simple to find (It also helps using Spotlight)<br /><br />+Dashboard and Expose- Widgets + Easy way to find what you have open = FUN<br /><br />+iLife- Bottom like, iPhoto and iMovie BLOW AWAY windows standard photoviewer and windows movie maker (garbage, cheap)<br /><br />+ The touchpad- It's more than just being big, it's amazing. The gestures make the experience so much easier and fun. Want to scroll down? Place to fingers on the pad and swipe down. There are others but hard to explain ;)<br /><br />+ It's just flat out fun to use- Windows just started getting dull for me. Mac is fresh and exciting. When you buy a car do you want to get a transportation (PC) or do you want to get something that you enjoy driving (MAC)? I enjoy driving Mac everyday.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Adjusting: It's difficult adjusting using windows all my life. But apple has set up many videos online to help you along. Thanks!<br /><br />- The little things I was used to: again goes back to adjusting to a new OS. Alt+F4 is now Command+W. Gotta get used to it. No biggie. <br /><br />Honestly, maybe I'm being biased (sue me) but I can't find a lot of cons yet as I'm still very new to this.<br /><br />Bottom Line: You want a mac. Start a new adventure in your life. It's not too late. Mac will make your life easier in ways you couldn't imagine.<br /><br />And hey, you might just have a little fun while you're at it ;)

13" MacBook Pro
I am extremely satisfied with my new MacBook - glad I waited for the 2010 model. For those concerned about processor speed, the Core 2 Duo processor works very well - no need for the i5/i7.  Battery life is great and the bottom of the computer stays cool to the touch - much cooler than my old HP laptop.  Display looks great as well.  The touchpad works very well - very similar to the iPhone touchscreen. Wish I would not have waited so long to switch to a Mac.<br /><br />Edit: Just thought I'd share that full startup, not just wake from sleep, takes less than fifteen seconds and full shutdown takes less than five - much faster than any Windows PC I've had. <br /><br />On the subject of shipping, I originally placed my order on Tuesday (4/13/2010) and received an email on 4/16 with a projected delivery date of 4/20. Being curious, I decided to check the delivery date for a new order placed on 4/16. The projected delivery date for an order placed on 4/16 was 4/17, so I canceled my original order and placed a new one at about 3:30 pm. UPS delivered the computer at 9 this morning - great turnaround time.  Overall, I am very pleased with my MacBook and with Amazon.

Pleasantly Surprised.
This is my first mac notebook. I bought a mac mini last year and just love it. I ended up hooking it to the television as a home theater PC and found myself in need of a computer at times when the mac mini was acting as TV. I was upgrading from a 2004 dell laptop to this and I'm just noticing some things that I'd like to point out if you have never had a mac laptop.<br />Built in webcam that acts as an ambient light sensor when it gets brighter/darker in the room.<br />Backlit keys.<br />Touchpad/trackpad gestures that can be real time savers compared to a full keyboard (& i am a keyboard fanatic)<br />I have not messed with it yet, but I think you can talk to a macbook too and it will launch applications or do things (my friends do that)<br />The magsafe power adapter is like a magnet connection so if you kick the cord you won't break anything, it will just pop out.<br /><br />Overall, I like it. It's fairly light. I wanted something light with good battery life. I knew I was happy with the graphics card on the mini so I shouldn't be let down here either since this is an improvement on that. I have to question whether I will use the cd drive very much, but I guess it's cool if I need to rip a cd to iTunes. When I had this on today at work next to my dell and external monitor I could only notice how dingy/brown their screens look in comparison. The colors on this screen are really great. The keyboard has a nice tactile feel to it as well, I really never miss a beat with this thing. The firewire connection was useful to transfer my settings from the mac mini as well.

A Mac, a PC, a work of art.
Why drop a grand and then some on a 13-inch notebook computer when you can have one for a nickel or less?  You get what you pay for. Add in everything you really, really want and you're within a few bucks of the price of this MacBook Pro.<br /><br />Now consider the not so obvious, like the ability to run Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 at native speed with Boot Camp and your own copy of Windows or as a virtual PC within Mac OS X using free software like Oracle VM VirtualBox or commercial products like Parallels and VMWare.  The same machine that lets you and the family surf the web in maximum safety thanks to Mac OS X can be the same one that hooks up to the office over VPN with Windows, and neither interferes with the other.<br /><br />Gigabytes of commentary have been written about the engineering of this latest edition, particularly using a faster Intel Core 2 Duo chip instead of the new Core i3 or i5, but the performance says it best.  At church, I run Microsoft PowerPoint to project hymn lyrics on our twin LCD projectors while using Audacity to record the choir through a USB interface from our Behringer mixer.  First-person programs like NoLimits Roller Coaster Simulation run with a smoothness and fluidity that nearly mimics a real-life video shot from the front seat.  The Mac build of GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) screams through complex special effects filters like a banshee.  Bing Maps powered by Microsoft Silverlight caused the fan on my previous MacBook to whine like an Airbus A340 taxiing.  The MacBook Pro handles it without breaking a sweat.  Remember, when you watch prime-time TV or go to the movies, you're seeing some special effects created with software running on this very same technology.  Now it's yours as well.<br /><br />The backlit keyboard has a satisfying feel that'll have touch typists up to speed in no time.  Apple uses the nearly extinct inlaid injection process to produce the keys.  The markings are molded all the way through, not silkscreened or stuck on like decals.  They will never, ever rub off.  You haven't seen keys made this way since the glory days of IBM and Olivetti typewriters.<br /><br />Although I still use a Logitech Marble Mouse trackball (now relabeled as the Trackman Marble), the big trackpad is the best I've come across (compared to my company-issued Lenovo T400).<br /><br />And, of course, there's that aluminum case and Museum of Modern Art-worthy design.  It's a touch of style that makes work and play more enjoyable.

my first Mac, very nice!!
I use a laptop for email, internet, movies, backing up iPhone and I need MS Office.  I was tired of constant updates and the threat of viruses from my PC.  I'm glad I went with the Pro version.  The metal case feels solid.  The backlit keys are handy when watching TV and browsing online.  The screen and backlit keys are light sensitive.  The screen dims in dark and the keys light up.  It taking some getting used to using the HUGE thumb pad.  <br /><br />PROS:  I love the long battery life.  Close the case and the Mac goes into hibernation mode.  I tested it yesterday, it had no negative effect on the battery after a couple hours.  that means you can close the lid and walk away.  Come back later and open it and touch the pad and you are back up immediately!!  Sweet!  I'm delightfully surprised how cool this thing stays.  My old HP would get HOT and the fan never seemed to cool enough or shut off.  This thing never gets hot.  Heck it never seems to even warm up.  The DVD/CD slot is just that, a slot.  No drawer to slide out.  Pretty slick.  I was pretty nervous the first time I used it.  The disc has to be all but 1/2" in for it to grab it.  I love the lightness of this thing.  Easy to grab and go.  I love the brightness of the screen.  I went from a 15.4" so I was concerned about this being too small.  but it is the perfect size.  I'm a happy consumer!!  I haven't had a chance to try all the Mac programs.  The wife had me print some pictures for her last night.  I was really impressed how easy iPhoto was to edit.  It really did a nice job with it's "enhance" button that adjust the colors.  I am happy to finally have a SD slot.  I love the fact that I can send Excel and Word documents to my PC. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X86ZAS">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Home & Student Edition</a>  <br /><br />CONS:  When installing the MS Office the DVD player seemed really loud.  When copying CD's this noise didn't happen.  CD read rate is slow.  When ripping a CD to iTunes the player only got up to 7-8x.  I'm not real excited about the power jack.  It is held in magnetically.  So it easily falls out when the Mac is in my lap.  But with the long battery life I realized the I don't need to constantly charge it like the old PC.  So kinda a mute point.  <br /><br />Packaging:  Amazon has got it figured out.  The box was well packaged and arrived in perfect shape.  I went to UPS a day early and had them hold it so I could pick it up first thing in the morning instead of waiting impatiently for the truck.

The best 13.3 laptop you can buy.
Like most great apple products, there's already hundreds of well written reviews covering everything from it's wonderful backlit keyboard, to the beautiful aluminum unibody. There's really nothing else I can add, besides the fact that I AM LOVING IT! This Macbook Pro 13 is simply sublime. I recommend it to anyone who's in the market for a new laptop. <br /><br />Pros: Everything<br />Cons: No matte screen option from apple, but there are 3rd party solutions.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029TSTT4">moshi iVisor AG 13, Anti-Glare Screen Protector for Macbook 13" Unibody</a><br />Other: The battery will last 10 hours if you don't use it, but average usage will still give you a very generous 6-8 hours, depending on what you're doing.<br /><br />Try it out in person at bestbuy if you have any doubts, but I can promise you won't regret buying this wonderful piece of engineering. <br /><br />One last thought<br /><br />Installing windows 7 with boot camp is as simple as you could make it. Having the ability to run windows 7 along with OSX makes this computer extremely useful. I have my hard drive split 50/50 one partition for OSX and one for windows 7. While I love using OSX, there a many games that require windows to play. I have a few games installed on windows 7 to test out the NVIDIA 320m and was very surprised at how well it performed. I play Left 4 Dead 2 at the native resolution with medium to high settings and still get 40-60 frames per second. Needless to say, i'm impressed.    <br /><br />This Macbook Pro is the first Apple product I've bought. Never owned an ipod or anything else made by Apple. In fact, for awhile I was what some would call an 'Apple hater,' but this computer has completely changed my perspective. And if this is the first Apple purchase for you, I'm convinced you'll feel the same way.<br /><br />-Jeff

A Thing of Beauty
This is my fourth Mac and they keep getting better.I had some reservations about the glossy screen and even though it does reflect it works and works very well.I loved the matte screen but this has taken little time to accept and get used to.<br /> <br />Now,the track pad and this is impressive in that it is not a gimmick and eliminates so much clicking and dragging and fishing around for back buttons and the like.And all done with subtle gestures on the good sized trackpad.Be sure to activate the tap to click function so you can use this subtle method to click or secondary click or drag with one finger.No need to go up for a back button to go back page-just swipe three fingers.Desktop and expose can be activated by vertical swipes,etc.It even has a lighted keyboard for a poor typer like myself.<br /> <br />The case is of course milled from a solid piece of aluminum and along with the Mac OS this is a thing of beauty.Apple is to computers what Leica is to cameras so even though I never got that Leica I do have this Macbook Pro in my hand right now.Treat yourself if you can.

Main Reason Why A MacBook Pro Is A Good Purchase Is Ease Of Use
When you're out shopping for a new computer, one of the most important things you look for is price.  As consumers, we always want the best deals possible on every item we spend our hard earned money towards.  Apple MacBooks and all Apple computers in general always tend to be priced significantly higher than their Windows counterparts.  Some may argue there is just cause, others may argue there is no reason why a similar computer should be priced much higher.  The 13.3 MacBook Pro was my first foray in the Mac world.  After having it for a few days now, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that it's been worth every penny.  I've been using PCs for 20 years now, and even have a degree in computer engineering.  So it was very hard for me to make the switch, and it does take time.  The first thing I will tell every potential buyer is that you have to give it some time to get used to using a Mac.  If you buy a Mac and think you will be an expert at it in one day, you will be in for a rude awakening.  Obviously, I am still new to this and am learning new things every day about the Mac Operating System.<br /><br />The biggest reason why I am now telling people to buy a Mac is simply the ease of use.  As a society, we always tend to pay more for something that's easier to use or run.  With a Mac, that's definitely the case.  The second thing that we tend to pay more for is quality and craftsmanship.  That's another thing you will find with Apple computers.  Obviously with that said, any electronic item can have defects from a factory, that's to be expected, but I'd say that with a Mac, you'll be less likely to have issues out of box.<br /><br />Now going back to the main reason why I recommend a MacBook Pro, is again the ease of use.  Even though I am new to Macs, it's been a delight to see how easy things are to accomplish.  If you want to install in new software, it's as easy as double-clicking an icon, then when the program opens, you drag the new icon to the application folder.  Voila, you're done!  There are a few pieces of software that take more effort, but in general, most programs I installed, took a matter of seconds.  To uninstall a program, you just drag the icon from the application folder to trash.  Then you empty the trash, and the program is uninstalled.  How easy is that?  Thats of course just one example, but again, in the case of a Mac, everything just seems easier to work with than a Windows Machine.<br /><br />I'll talk again about quality of craftsmanship.  When you take the MacBook Pro out of the box, you know immediately just how wonderful the build really is.  When you buy a computer in this day and age, you just don't expect it to be so nice out of the box.  You of course wish it was nice, but it usually isn't.  When you take the MacBook Pro out of the box, you know you're holding something special.  The quality of the unibody construction is second to none.  I don't think I can find another manufacturer that has notebooks as high quality as Apple does.<br /><br />Finally, there are still certain other features such as the glass touchpad that I haven't even talked about.  It's one of those features that you don't realize you need until you've tried it out.  Multitouch hand gestures is truly the wave of the future in touchpads on notebooks.  The ability to have two, three, and even four finger gestures is amazing.  The ability to scroll up and down a document or website, or the ability to go back and forth between pages, and finally, the ability to display all the programs and documents you have open at once.  These are all little touches that Apple has added to their line of notebooks that make the MacBooks truly special and unique.

Nice upgrade from the Windows experience
After replacing many failed parts in my $2,500 Thinkpad T61 machine, I decided to try out a Mac for my notebook computing needs.   As a former Windows user and P/C tech, I am very impressed!  Everything about the machine is phenomenal, with the exception of the Seagate Momentus hard disk which I will be replacing (they are known for their reliability issues.  This thing boots up in about 10 seconds, runs fast and cool (fan usually stays off), no bloatware installed like most Windows laptops and just feels like a solid piece of equipment.  <br /><br />Well done Apple!

First time Mac owner
I just wanted to start out by saying this is my first written review, but I feel that I have to comment on what a great machine this Macbook Pro is. As my title says this is the first Mac I have ever owned. I have used PCs my entire life and I can't believe how much better a Mac is. My last laptop I had was an HP and when I first used this new Macbook I couldn't believe what a difference there was just from doing the simplest of tasks. I can't believe how fast this Macbook starts up and shuts down. My HP laptop would take forever to start up and shut down which got pretty annoying at times. Even trying to do simple tasks the HP laptop would constantly freeze or lock up quite often. <br /><br />Another really annoying thing with my HP laptop was that it would always heat up pretty bad where my palm would rest below the keyboard after using it for a little while. I would then have to put it to sleep and wait for the laptop to cool down before using it again. I haven't had any heat issues with the Macbook and it's so nice not having to put it to sleep and wait for it to cool down. I've had this Macbook for about 2 weeks now and have had zero problems with it. I can't believe how smoothly it runs and how fast it is at doing everything. Since I have always used Windows switching from that interface to the Mac interface has been very different for me. However I'm getting the hang of it now and it's amazing how simple everything on the Mac interface is to use.<br /><br />I also wanted to comment on just what a great looking machine it is. I love the aluminum finish to it and I would definitely recommend paying a little more for the Macbook Pro over the white Macbook. The aluminum finish alone is worth the extra money. I also wanted to throw in for those who might be interested in doing a little gaming on the Macbook that it runs games pretty well. I recently downloaded the Starcraft II beta and I was able to run the game very good on medium settings without any slowdown. Overall I would highly recommend this Macbook Pro to anyone interested in getting a new Macbook or switching from a PC to Mac for the first time as I have. Now that I know how great Macs are I will never buy another PC again.

Love it.
I've owned Macs since 2000, but I've never owned a laptop. So it's hard to compare this to others but I have to say I'm having a hard time prying myself away from my gorgeous little MBP. I'd been waiting and waiting...and waiting patiently for Apple to upgrade their MBPs and when they finally came out, I have to admit I was disappointed they didn't update the 13"...but then I read more and thought about it and realized it's really not that big a deal. For what I need, the 13" suits me perfectly. Also, reading this article helped shed some light on why Apple didn't put the i5 in the 13".<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Apple creates techno high art. The sleek styling and gorgeous looks of all their products are like porn to an artsy design nerd like me. The solid feel of the thing is great too. I've only owned mine for one day so I can't say much about the battery life so far but I know that one was one of the improvements in the update so I'm sure it will impress. The trackpad is pretty awesome. It took no time at all for me to get used to how it works.<br />On a side note, I was very pleased with my service from Amazon. Placed my order on Saturday night and was shipped by Tuesday.

Excellent macbook for the price
I had ordered this product on the day of its release i.e. 4/13, initially there was no delivery date, but on Monday I got a mail that it was shipped and received it very next day. I love amazon order fulfillment system. This is my first macbook, initially had Dell and Hp. But cant really compare to these brands...especially HP..its crap.<br />Now back to macbook, I am impressed from packaging itself..just what is needed. Out of the box and its up and running in no time. I initially though that being a windows user will take me a longer time to adjust. But Macbook pro proved me wrong, in a day's time I picked the macbook's world. Now it seems, i am owning macbook since ages.<br />Its fast, smooth and not much or not too less. Very quiet and responsive. I was waiting for this upgrade for a long time, always felt the pinch of buying 13.3 with less hardware, but now it is just perfect for browsing, gaming and more. I don't need to look for a laptop for next 5 yrs at least. <br />Moral of the story, best buy for the price...guys reading this review...don't think too much. Just go for it.

Absolutely Amazing!
Anyone who claims a Windows PC is better than a Mac is sniffing glue! I have been using Windows forever, but this is my first Macbook Pro, and it is true... Once you go Mac, you never go back! This Macbook Pro is a dream machine! Even with 4GBs of memory and a dual processor, it still blows my Windows 7 laptop out of the water! Not only is it beautifully constructed, it is a joy to use! I really thought moving to a Mac would be a learning curve.... Well, it really wasn't, and I picked it up immediately! And let me not forget the software that comes with it... iPhoto is a jewel, it's face recognitioning software is a photographers dream!   Not only does it work incredibly well, but it learns pretty quick, and sorts your photos beautifully, in stacks... Oh.... I could just go on for hours praising this machine and the iPad, but all I will say is if you have the money, and are tired of Microsoft's tired promises of next time it will be better... GO MAC! And you will truly never go back! Now I understand why people are so fanatic about their Macs! They truly are quality machines!

This little baby rocks!
First let me say that I have spent the vast majority of my professional life working on PCs, mostly Dells.  I also bought Dell PCs for my home and have been through 3 or 4 at this point.  I've had Windows 95, Windows Millenium, and Windows XP.  Last year, when my last Dell appeared to outlive its usefulness at about 4 1/2 years, having slowed down to a crawl and almost coming to a stop thanks to McAfee antivirus protection, I decided it was time for my next computer.  So I started doing my typical exhaustive research.  At that time, Windows Vista had the market and I heard nothing but negative things about it.  At the same time, I'd noticed that one by one, most of my friends had switched to Mac.  So I finally decided to do that, too.  Bought an iMac 24" and have never been a happier camper on the computer. Love, love, love it.<br /><br />This spring, anticipating some work travel coming up and also foot surgery in the summer that will keep me at home, mostly on the couch, for a good 12 weeks, I decided it was time for a portable something.  Friends showed me their Asus Netbooks, and I was intrigued.  Checked it out and thought I'd get one.  Even though they were Windows-based.  But I liked the long battery life.  Then I got enticed by the MacBook Air, but decided that as sexy and light at it is, it was too expensive for what you got and the battery life was awful.  Next I was looking at the Asus "Thin and Light" models, which looked like a good compromise.  Long battery life, lightweight, and several hundred dollars cheaper than the MacBook Pro 13" which I also looked at.  What to do, what to do.  Well, after reading what seemed like hundreds of customer reviews not only for the computers but for Windows 7, I finally realized that I really and truly wanted the Mac.  The Windows users were grousing a lot.  The Mac users just loved their computers.  Getting my tax refund check in the mail the morning I was going to make a purchase clinched the deal. I bought the 13" MacBook Pro.<br /><br />I received it this weekend, along with an Airport Express router, set it all up with little difficulty, and was happily -- very happily -- playing with my new MBP yesterday.  I couldn't be happier.  The computer is a joy to look at and work on.  The display is clear, sharp, and beautiful.  The keyboard is very comfortable, even typing on my lap.  I just adore the trackpad, even though I'm still getting used to all the finger movements.  It found the internet and my network printer in a snap.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't work well with copying files from my iMac with Migration Assistant.  I probably did something wrong and will have to call Apple Support to figure it out, but all my files got dumped into one directory that I have trouble finding.  I assumed the photos would go to iPhoto, the music to iTunes, and the Word docs to Word.  But noooooooo!  Hopefully, my friends at Apple Care will help me out -- they were wonderful when I was trying to set up my network printer.<br /><br />So I'm happy.  Very happy.  My husband's happy, too, since I won't be kicking him off the iMac that much anymore, and we can both play on the web at the same time.  There's nothing much to watch on TV anyway!<br /><br />Edit:  I noticed that the MacBook Pro is no longer available directly from Amazon and delivered free by Prime.  What happened?  This is just a scant week after I bought it.  Also, the printer I bought, the Canon PIXMA 560 is also no longer available through Prime, even though that's how I bought it less than a week ago.  What gives?<br /><br />Edit 2:  So, I see this is back to being available directly from Amazon and shipped free with Prime.  How weird!

Its like driving a German Car
That's the best way to describe how it feels to use this laptop. Everything about this little computer feels so solid and well built. This is my first Apple computer. I've always used PC's for everything. I originally bought an Asus UL series but was unimpressed by its build quality and the trackpad was horrible. Now that I have some money to afford nice things I don't mind paying for them so I decided to check this out at an Apple store and was blown away. The trackpad really won me over. What I was really looking for in a laptop was a pleasant internet surfing/email/Hulu user experience while on the couch or away from home.  Did not want to carry a mouse around. The hand gestures are simply incredible and work so well (although the 3 finger swipe tends to be a little flakey, sometimes I have to do it more than once for it to work). The OS is a pleasure to use. Yes I'm still tinkering with it but its so much fun and refreshing trying something new. I was just so bored of Windows and after using the macbook for a few days I try to avoid my PC desktop whenever possible..lol  Anyway for anyone who wants a high end portable computer and appreciates well built, quality items do not pass this up. You will not find another laptop out there that comes close to the user experience this thing provides. Very well done Apple!

a good buy
Most reviewers like this notebook and i am no exception. I gave this product 5 stars. <br /><br />I just have a few things to add. <br /><br />One thing that i don't like about this new 13' macbook pro is the displayport.<br />Yes this model's displayport now can support audio with proper adapter to HDMI(that is actually one of the reason i decided the time has arrived to buy this mbp). The left side of the macbookpro is already crowded, with this additional adapter and if you have few USB devices attached, the left side looks very messy. Kind of defeat the purpose of the clean design of the notebook. <br />Not a biggie, just one thing i can pick on this otherwise perfect machine. :)<br /><br /><br />I use the laptop to do light reading and web browsing around the house and backyard, and when i want to do some real work, i hook it up back to lcd monitor and it feels i am working on a desktop pc. I really like the fact that 4G Ram come standard now with better integrated video card. C2D CPU is not bad, i don't think it will make any big difference compare to i3 if they offer this. <br /><br />The weakest link of this laptop i think is the harddrive. 5400rpm is okay but not great, SSD is still too expensive even for just 128G size(even after market). I hope apple soon can offer some hybrid solution.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

PC users will be AMAZED
for awhile i was kind of against macbooks because to me they had just been over priced hunks of metal.  i went in the store a couple times and tried previous models out and was not impressed at all. but when i came in and tried the most recent models out i started looking into them a bit more and was surprised at how it was such a powerful computer.  its AMAZING! when i was on skype with my boyfriend on my hp dv4 i could only run one app at a time or it would start acting crazy. when we got on skype on the macbook i was able to do EVERYTHING with out so much as a hiccup. everything is so FAST and from a PC to mac i had no time adjusting.i am just dazzled by its efficiency. and on top of that i got a student discount on my whole purchase :) one thing to beware of...the battery says 10hrs...so far with settings on average im getting only 6 hours or so,i guess to get the 10 hours u need to have eerything on low.still better than any high performance PC i know of.kudos to apple.

Blows my Windows laptop away
I'm generally only moved to write reviews when a product is either terrible or wonderful, and this is no exception. The new Macbook Pro 13" is one beautiful piece of machinery, and just what I needed after years of struggling with a Dell laptop. I'm a freelance writer with tough deadlines and have lost many a draft and even finished articles due to random shutdowns, freeze-ups, data loss and other problems with the PC. I've only had my new Macbook for a few days, but it has already blown my old computer out of the water.<br /><br />That's not to say that my experience with this Macbook will always be problem-free, but it operates so smoothly and intuitively that I'm already saving lots of time that was previously spent twiddling my thumbs while the clunky, slow PC tried to perform the simplest of tasks. The transition from PC to Macbook has been extremely smooth - it only took me a day of tinkering to get the hang of it - everything just *makes sense*. <br /><br />My only gripe is the extreme reflectivity of the glass screen (ordering from Amazon, I didn't even realize a non-reflective screen was an option). But that's really no biggie considering the abundance of pros.

I'm in love with my first mac!
I've been using Windows for more than 15 years and actually have been itching the buy a mac over the last few years but haven't got around to. I came very close to buying the last model, the $1,499 one with larger HD and faster memory. So glad I didn't since this version's base model fits every of my need already and saved me $300!  <br /><br />Back to the machine, I have only had it for a week and I'm in love already! Talk about performance and ease of use. My lovely mac starts up in less than 20 secs and awakes from sleep in ONE SECOND! Also, if any one has any concern about switching over to Mac, it's a no brainer. The control is very intuitive (and pretty :) and you just need to look up short cuts online (if you're a keyboard person like me) and spend a day or two getting used to and you'll be set! The trackpad is also VERY convenient - I still feel like I'm doing some magic with the four finger swipe :) <br /><br />Some down sides are MS Office and Windows Media Player. I use WMP to play overseas radio and have downloaded Quicktime and Flip4Mac and what not and it's still trivial that I might get it work for 5 min then it'd stop. It has never been a problem on a PC. I'm not complaining about this against Mac but would appreciate an easier solution. I can't rate MS Office yet because I'm using my work laptop to do most of those work but have heard that PowerPoint doesn't work in a Mac as well in as in a PC. <br /><br />One thing on delivery. I ordered my Mac on 4/14, a day after it became available on Amazon, went through the "ships in 2-4 weeks" phase to "preparing shipment" within a few days. And then on the day of delivery on 4/21, my tracking status on UPS says "shipment is damaged and will not be delivered". It already made all the way through to Washington, DC facility! I was very disappointed and called Amazon, they immediately placed a replacement order for me, upgraded to one-day shipping but by then it was back-ordered again on Amazon with the typical "ships in 2-5 weeks". I had to wait anyways because I needed to use my gift cards, and it finally arrived on 4/29! So for those who had blamed Amazon for not stocking up or for its slow delivery, 1) it's not really their fault, and 2) your story wasn't the worst!

First Mac, but won't slam Windows
I usually only feel inclined to write something when really motivated to (either good or bad). But, I am going to be objective with this review because I definitely am not in the Mac "Cult" as I always called it before I bought one. <br /><br />First - the feel, aesthetics and look on this machine is what first catches your eyes. It is clearly well built, feels sturdy and akin to the one reviewer comparing it to a German car...It's just got that feeling of being well put together. <br /><br />There are some things that take some getting used to as compared to a PC. The keyboard short cuts are a little strange, the only thing I can imagine is that this is to avoid accidental key commands??? Getting around the operating system is different but becoming a bit more natural now after 2 weeks. The machine does boot up pretty quickly and I haven't had any problems with the programs as of yet. Though, I haven't really started adding to the machine (in transition). The machine does what it should (and, as it should given the price tag). <br /><br />I was concerned about repurchasing software that I have had on Windows, but the boot camp utility is terrific. It easily allows for the partition and running of another Windows OS (I am using Windows 7 professional).  I have installed my software on to that, to avoid rebuying the expensive stuff. It was a breeze and Apple's guide is simple to do that, anyone could do it! <br /><br />The specifications are rather good and solid. More than enough for the average computer user. I've got Adobe programs which run fine!  Though I don't know the video editing/gaming - but imagine it'll be good too.<br /><br />The battery is unbelievable. You can probably get the 9-10 the advertise in a low power, low application running state, but even when you are on it, the thing lasts! You get spoiled really easily. <br /><br />Everything so far has led me to believe that this will last and be consistent through my use of the machine. <br /><br />To the people who loathe windows now, there is some things that come with the territory of buying big manufactured PCs (Apple isn't huge in terms of the amount of people who own them)...slower speeds with use is common - you have to take care of certain things. Windows 7 is a lot better than Vista. But I suppose that's another review...<br /><br />Anyways... I would suggest this to anyone curious of making the jump that truly use computers often. If you're a casual user who just goes on the book or space, email and word processing - save your money! But if you are looking to run heavy applications or have a solid machine and can poney up the money, I would say go for it. I'm hoping that all the positive, almost obsessive support for a Mac is warranted and that in the future, I won't have questioned the purchase (as I said, its my first Mac) !

I love Macbook Pro 13"
I had a very difficult time deciding between 13" Duo vs. 15" i5. I went with this because I thought it's good enough for normal use. I don't open 100 applications at once - maybe 4-6 at-most. Macbook is fast, easy, and joy to use. I also have a Lenovo Windows 7, but don't use it much anymore.

A perfect system
I have run most OS.  Solaris, Linux, OS/2, and various flavor of Windows.  I recently got a MacBook Pro 13" and not only is the hardware great but the OS is very easy to work with and use.  I got the base system with no upgrades.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Size and form factor<br />- Keyboard - Smooth and fast<br />- Trackpad - gestures work great.  <br />- OSX Snow Leopard.<br />- Battery life - 10 hours is real.<br />- Screen -  stunning.<br />- Boot-up/Shutdown - very fast<br />- Wake-up - very fast<br />- 4 Gig Memory<br />- iLife '09<br />- Initial setup is a breeze.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Should include the adapter for connecting to an external video device.<br />- Apple has to replace the battery.  But the battery (calibrated now and then) should last 5 years.<br />- I am afraid to scratch it. :-) The thinkpad this replaced hid them better.<br /><br />By far, this is the nicest system I have worked on.   Even at 13.3" the screen is very clear and easy to work on. <br /><br />I can recommend this system for anyone who wants to just get work done.  The OS is clean and the platform is fast and stable.  If you do get it, I suggested getting iWorks '09 as well for productivity.  That is &lt; $100 for the family pack version.<br /><br />Apple continues to raise the bar.  If you compare this system with any system of the same size and features, you will be surprised how much more expensive the Windows based competitors are.<br /><br />For me, it would be an easy purchase if I had to make the choice again.

Running Virtual Windows and producting working well
Was debating higher priced 2.66 and this one.  Ended up saving $300 and buying this one.  This works fine. I am running VMWare and Windows 7 so I can run MS Office 2010 beta and MSN messenger (can't do video chat with the Mac OS version yet).  Used the $300 savings from the higher priced one to buy Windows products. The 4GB of RAM and this computer is good enough to get really good performance.<br />This machine can also stream video content to the 24inch apple monitor which is only evident when first starting the program that the task is reaching the upper limits of what it is capable of (a little fuzzy when first starting the task but clears up some as it starts).  It is not a problem for my wife's 15 inch macbook (last years middle model) but I can tell in some of those tasks this one is a little less powerful BUT it can still stream the content to the 24 inch monitor and vmware with windows is excellent.  I will mainly use it for analyzing sound for studies and word processing in windows.

Wow. Amazing.
Ok so I didnt get a i5 because I felt the price was a little high and my desktop is maxed with the some great gear so figured i didnt need it. I also couldnt decide between this and a best buy vaio CW27 that had a i5 but the reviews werent great for the vaio thats around the same price. I have used Macs in the past but never  owned one. I have to say this is probably my 6th laptop in about 8 years. And all I have to say to apple is WOW this thing is built like a tank. The one piece is awesome it feels so sturdy. Opened it up and right out the gate everything I threw at it, it just worked. The programs poped right up with no lag like windows. <br /><br />Were my windows PC would stutter playing my Canon 7D's 1080 videos the mac played right through them and I edited a little video in imovie just fine. So I am happy and really liking it so far. I will probably upgrade the 4gb memory in a few months when 8gb drops a little in price. Right now 8Gb memory is up there like $300 -$400.<br /><br />I notice on sites people complaining that macbooks dont have Blu-ray and really why would apple put blu-ray into they're laptops when they own the itunes store and sell movies to download. And most of the time with new blus you get a free digital copy so why would you want to bother caring around the extra discs. I'm gonna let my PS3 stick to playing Blus on my big screen.lol.<br /><br />

great deal
I do not like small earphones that go into the ear. After a very short time I find them very uncomfortable. I also hate anything pressing on my head.<p>I was looking for a set of over the ear phones which were light weight, comfortable, had excellent sound fidelity, a longish cord so I can be comfortably away from my stereo, and effectively blocked outside sounds. My primary motivation for buying these phones was so that I could listen to opera and really hear the phrases. I wanted all this for under $30.00<p>These head phones delivered. As soon as they arrived, I tested them on a variety of music types at a variety of volumes. The phones are very comfortable and except for a bit of warming of my ears, which was rather pleasant, I barely noticed them. The cushion on the crosspiece is thick enough so that you don't really feel it.<p>Sound fidelity is excellent. I was actually able to hear parts of music and instruments that I had never noticed before. This was especially true with classical, opera and jazz. The balance between bass and treble was very good, although if you really like loud thumping base, you may be a bit dissappointed. <p>I was not able to get the volume up loud enough to notice any distortion before it was too much for me, so I can't really say that there will be no distortion if you like really loud music. <p>If you are looking for headphones that are a good bargain for the money and have a limited budget, these are it.

Unbeatable Budget Headphone for Traveling with iPod
I own a couple of pairs of headphones for different purposes, the Sennheiser HD202 is for listening to my iPod.  I'm living in a city where mobile-zombies are addicted to incessant cell phone chatting in the public.  The headphones' ability of providing isolation from outside annoyance is of utmost importance when I consider purchasing a pair of headphones for travelling purpose.  The HD202, sealed in design, excels in that functionality.  Most noises are decently blocked away from my listening pleasure.  The HD202 is mid-sized, and I don't find portability a burden.  The headphones are circum-aural, for my average-sized ears, which contributes a lot to the good isolation.  The pleather ear-pads and cushion under the head-band are comfy, no complaints for extended wearing for me.<br /><br />Sound-wise, I found the HD202 performing unexpectedly well for headphones in this price range.  These cans could be driven by the iPod with ease.  Judging by listening impressions, I found the HD202's frequency response even and flat, with a little emphasis on the bottom and a bit roll-off on the high end.  Bass-heads might found its lows less then head-bombing, but it's just adequate for me, allowing mids and highs passing through to paint a balanced sound profile.  Since the HD202 is a sealed-type design, notes above the mids are not as open and airy as its open counterparts.  Details are of cuz not as good as the Sennheiser HD600, my reference phones, but it's totally acceptable for a pair of travelling cans.  The Grado SR-60 has more details, but its highs are, surprisingly, harsher than the HD202, and it just fails to block any noise from outside which defeat the very intention of evading the roaring of the zombies.<br /><br />My listening spectrum is broad, ranging from classical, operas, chansons francaises, jazz, old rock, psychedelic, indies, metal to trip hop.  Although not perfect (what could be anyway?), the HD202 performs satisfactorily in every genre I have tried through it, and favors music with heavy beats, like Portishead and Morcheeba.  It also sounds good with Doors, Cream, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath.  It's best for dance, pop and rock.  For classical fans, the HD202 could also bring smile on your face.  It's not the smoothest phones in the world, but its shortcomings (a bit dry and inability to retrieve full details) are forgivable and it could let you forget hi-fi and dive into musical nirvana.  Gieseking's Debussy piano readings from his 78r/m era are just magical, and the pluckings of the double-bass in Munch's "Symphonie Fantastique" (1954 version) are tangible and rich.  The HD202 also "Rings", pun not intended, well with Wagner.  The Bayreuth acoustics are understated, yet remains beautiful, through the HD202.  I enjoy every bow across the strings and the "Ho-jo-to-ho!" by the Walkures.  For jazz, both vocals (Lady Day) and instrumentals (Monk and Coltrane) swing.<br /><br />For durability, the HD202 doesn't score too high.  The cord on the left can has developed bad contact after 2 years' service.  Since the cords are non-detachable, the ailment could not be remedied.  I thought of buying a new set of HD202 but was bitten by the up-grade bug and bought a HD212pro instead.  And boy what wrong I have done and feel regreted for my conversion.  The HD212 might have deeper bass, but it doesn't come close to the HD202 regarding naturalness which I place high regarding music listening.  It has TOO MUCH bass for my taste.  Sounds are richer but somewhat artificial in the 212.  I much prefer the 202 to the bass-exaggerated, unnatural and over-rated 212pro.<br /> <br />For listeners not obsessed with bass fetishism and hi-fi-similacrum who want to enjoy music on the road, Sennheiser HD202 is highly recommended.

Fine earphones
I bought a set of Sennheiser HD-202 headphones through Amazon a few days ago, paid the $5.00 for 3 day shipping (couldn't find anything else to boost the total past $25.00) and the phones arrived today--well packed. I'm not an audiophile and can't say but that the headphones sound simply splendid, whether listening to CD's, tapes or radio, including FM transmitted XM radio reception.  The bass is there, but not overwhelming.  The overall experience of listening through these phones is remarkably different and richer than hearing the same music through radio or small boombox speakers.  The balance and enhancement of the frequency range is just unique--though this is probably a quality of most any good headphone.<br /><br />I plugged the smaller jack into a variety of radios, a stero system and a boom box--all with fine, sound altering effect.  The radios included a Tecsun PPL-550 and Grundig Satellit 800.  It worked beatufully in a second-hand Sony CFD-S38 boombox and a new Panasonic stereo system.  And it sure enhanced the TV audio.<br /><br />They fit comfortably, fit well over my ears and do not completely mask even subtle outside sounds--unless you turn them way up, which I'm inclined to avoid doing.  The HD-202 headphones also enhance stray sound artifacts from less-than-ideal recordings or poor radio reception--but that's not the fault of earphones that seem to allow you to hear everything more clearly.  All in all, a good product, so far, for a little over $20.00.

Are these $20 headphones?
After reading several reviews, I did something I usually don't do - I ordered a pair of these headphones without listening to them first. I have ordered earphones (the expensive in your ear kind) and was disappointed in both cases. I returned each of them. But these babies are just what I was looking for. I use them with my iPod. I also have a pair of the very expensive Sennheiser HD600 headphones, and while they are more open and more accurate (for 22 times the price they should be!!); I was very surprised how great these sound. When I got these, I thought the earpiece seemed a bit small, but they covered the ear fully, and after using them for a while, I didn't even notice that. I have a very large head, and I have not felt that these are tight at all; in fact I have worn them for several hours, with no discomfort at all. They are very light-weight too!! I have trusted the Sennheiser name for years, and these continue to enforce with me that the trust I have in the Sennheiser name is not unfounded. If you want a pair of headphones that has strong, clean bass, and great sounding mids and highs - get these babies!! You will not be disappointed!!

Great Value!!!
While I'm not an audiophile by any means, with age, I'm beginning to appreciate higher quality sound. Compared to my previous experiences with mediocre headphones (run-of-the-mill $20-ish Wal-Mart variety) these 202's completely blow away anything I've ever used before but, incredibly, only cost a few bucks more.<br /><br />As others have noted, these have very good bass response. So much in fact that I had to turn down the bass on my receiver while watching television. I could see how one might become annoyed with the routine of fiddling with settings but so far I don't mind. If it makes any difference, I didn't might the extra bass while listening to music. I just didn't care for big booming newscasts and sitcoms.<br /><br />Several reviewers also noted that the 202's were very tight fitting. I'm not calling them liars, as the topic is very subjective, but I have a fairly large head (7 3/4" hat size) and felt very comfortable wearing the Sennheiser's.<br /><br />I especially appreciated the extra care Sennheiser took in designing the packaging. Very easy to open. No scissors, knives, drills or chainsaws were necessary. Just popped open with my fingers.<br /><br />All said and done I'm VERY happy with my purchase. In fact I'm considering the purchase of second pair.<br /><br />BTW, despite the description not mentioning a 1/4" adapter being included, Sennheiser wisely include one as well as a belt clip to take up the slack on the generous cord. Unfortunately I wasted $5 and purchased an extra adapter from Amazon. Please correct the description Amazon!

Comfortable, clear, and really cool
I've been listening to a wide variety of music with my Sennheiser HD 202s for a few hours now, and I definitely have no complaints with the quality of these headphones. For the price range, I would put it at the top of the list.<p>First of all, they're from a company I can trust. The headphones were designed specifically for DJs, so I knew they wouldn't be (poor quality). And even when you compare the HD 202s with name brand headphones like the inexpensive Sony closed studio monitor headphones, you'll notice that the HD 202 is much more worth the 10 more bucks or so. The ear cups are bigger, so that means your ears won't get sore. These Sennheisers are also really light-weight, by the way, and there's a good combination of trebble and bass.<p>Get them, they're good

Great all around quality
I read through most of the reviews here before deciding on the Sennheiser HD 202 headphones.  I was a little worried about the fit on the ear as some people had mentioned, but decided to go for it anyway since the price was great for such nice quality.  I've had them now for about 3 weeks and I am *very* impressed.  And surprisingly enough, the detail I was most worried about is the thing I love most.  I would say I have average sized ears (for a female) and these headphones gently cup the outer, upper lobe and rest comfortably on the rest of the ear.  They have been worn for extended periods of time listening to music as well as gaming and I just haven't had them feel hot or tight at all.  All I can guess is that some people are just accustomed to the fit and feel of earbuds.(?)<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I took the chance with these since I had no way of trying them out before buying.  I ended up with a really sweet set of headphones with phenominal sound and fit.  Glad I didn't break down and go for the $40 up price range since these are perfect for what I need.  <br />

One of the BEST budget headphones!
Sound engineer in Los Angeles.  I LOVE these headphones and use them for everything - MIXING, airplanes, recreational listening, ect...<br /><br />Cons:  Not too many.  Tight on big heads.  Cups may feel small on big ears.<br /><br />Pros:  Rugged as heck - extremely durable construction.  Silky smooth and pretty darn FLAT sound.  Highs are rolled off just a tad.  This is not ideal for mixing but it's GREAT for LOUD listening, as you can crank them UP without yielding a 'tinty' sound.<br /><br />WHAT A DEAL.  As good or better than phones around $100.  Buy these now, you will not be disappointed.  My primary set that I take everywhere.

Great sound.  Good price.
These headphones are very good.  The sound is phenominal and they effectively block out most backround noise.  The bass and treble are very well balanced.  The chord is a bit long but that's not an issue as it can be wound up.  The headphones also came with a jack which allows me to plug them into my guitar amp etc.  I would highly recommend buying these headphones.

Sennheiser HD202
These headphones represent the best money I have spent on music in the past 12 month - and I buy CD's every week. I have always used earbuds and thought they sounded good - what a mistake - its like the difference between dipping your toe in a muddy puddle and swimming in the Ocean - The sound quality of these babies are nothing short of stunning. I can now hear things in my music that I could never hear before. The bass response is awesome with warm mids and sweet but solid highs. <br /><br />I paid $50 AUS on Ebay for these brand new - less than some of the less reliable asian brands and if I lost them today, I would go right out and buy another pair. <br /><br />The reason I chose Sennheiser is their reputation amongst professional Sound Engineers, DJ's and Audiophiles - they have always been a little out of my league price wise until I found these. .

Somewhat unexpected results
Well, I ordered these cheaper alternatives to the HD 280, which I was thinking of buying. Now to list my thoughts:<br /><br />Pro:<br />1. Sleek, although big.<br />2. Cheap, thought not free.<br />3. Pretty clear sound, although not crystal yet. Maybe after a couple of days it'll "burn-in."<br />4. Strong Bass, relatively speaking, when compared with my old headphones.<br />5. Good packaging, I didn't even have to get the scissors.<br /><br />Con:<br />1. I have big ears (huge), but I can't blame Sennheiser.<br />2. When it came out of the box, the left "phone" wouldn't produce as good sound as the right.<br />3. I almost broke the connector when yanking it out of the box, in my excitement.<br /><br />Possibly Pro, Possibly Con:<br />1. Long cord, which is usually a good thing, but can sometimes tangle. I keep mine rolled up until I need it (which is never).<br />2. Gets relatively warm, but in polar regions that's a pro. If you sweat like an animal, it's a con.<br />3. Not open headphones. Closed headphones are good for insulating sound, but will not produce as good sound as open ones.<br /><br />Final words:<br />If you want good sound quality, go with open headphones.<br />If you want good sound insulation, go with closed headphones (these).<br />If you want the best fit, get earbuds. They'll never be too big or small for your ears, unless your ear canal is really that small.<br />Personally, for good sound quality, I'm going to go with the HD 495's or maybe high-quality earbuds. For closed headphones, these will suffice, and I don't think the HD 280s are much better. So get these already, and don't yank the stuff out of the box like I did.

Amazing improvement even over the J2!
I purchased the J2 earbuds before doing some serious flying beginning in mid-summer, and I was well pleased with the quality on them.  My husband kept teasing me about the color--a lovely pink!--and it took some time to convince him to actually give them a listen.  When he finally did, he was blown away, and caved on the idea of getting his own.  Neither of us are huge audiophiles, but I'm a bit more picky about overall sound quality than he is. I still haven't found a set of iPhone speakers that I'm satisfied with after 2 years of searching.<br /><br />I came to Amazon to purchase a set of J2's in white, and found that the J3 version had just been released.  Reading up, I knew we needed to give these a try instead, and ordered the Titanium Silver for him.  <br /><br />As mentioned both in reviews and by JLab, you MUST allow these earbuds (and the J2 model) to burn in before you're going to get the fullest range of sound.  Even so, my husband was utterly stunned the first time he used his new pair.  He raved about them so much, I stole them for an hour to compare to my now well-used J2's, and I found improvements all the way around.  Even with a fresh out of the box pair that had perhaps a few hours of burn in time, the trebles are incredibly clear, and the bass to my ear is both significantly deeper and clearer in tone. (I'm a bass girl, this was the most important thing for me.) The audible background "hiss" you can hear on older or poorer quality mp3s is even muted.<br /><br />I bought a new Paparazzi Pink pair for myself that night, and my J2's have been relegated to emergency backup status.  With the release of the J3, J2 models are at an exceptional price, but these are so superior that they're well worth the extra money.<br /><br />Little things:  <br /><br />     The new packaging is fabulous; I hope more companies start working with Amazon to switch over to this type of packing material.  <br /><br />     The little case provided with the J3 model is a big plus. I have the larger case for travel and this one is way more convenient for daily use.  It's small enough to slip into a shirt or jacket pocket.<br /><br />     Four sizes of silicone ear buds will make it much easier to fit for some. I did transfer over mine from the J2 as the material from those feels a bit thinner and I preferred the old color My husband found he was most comfortable using different sizes for each ear, so having the wider variety of sizes worked well for him.  His only complaint is that even with the best fitting pair, occasionally he finds the fit to be almost too tight to the point of pressure-induced discomfort. Most of the time, it's not a problem. He did have ear issues as a child and I suspect this may be a factor, as I have had no trouble at all with either model.<br /><br />     For reference, both pair are being used with 1st gen iPhones for music and audiobooks.  I use the EQ settings for the iPod function, he makes no adjustments.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best products I've bought in any category this year!

The new J3s - great fit, stylish, & exceptional sound quality!
I purchased this item after having the JBuds J2 earphones for a few months and I can say from personal experience that these earphones are extremely improved from its predecessor, the J2s.  The new sleek and slim design fits comfortably into the ear and with four different size tips, one surely has to fit.  The cord is very durable even though it is slightly slimmer than the previous model.  Also, the four different colors JLab Audio offers helps personalize this product towards your individual preference.  After "burning-in" the new J3s, I noticed an overall clear, high quality sound.  I've tested this with a variety of music and have noticed improved highs and bass as well.  Some people have commented that that there is too much treble but I haven't really noticed this.  After you do a "burn-in," the sound quality should significantly improve.  The sound is perfect for me but I am just your average music lover, not an audiophile.  When listening to music with these earphones, I notice instruments I've never heard before on my standard iPod earphones.<br /><br />These earphones are great for its price and I expected no less from JLab Audio.  Although I am not a sound expert, these earphones should live up to your expectations.  The J3's deliver exceptionally on many attributes and are definitely superior to other earphones in its price range.  The new and improved J3s are worthy of 5 stars for me.  I have had no problems with this product so far and the 1 year warranty that JLab offers should hopefully suppress any worry you might have regarding its durability.  The mini case these earphones come with is also a wonderful addition.  It is convenient, small, and perfect for travel.  Whether you are new to JLab products or a returning customer, you should be satisfied with the J3 earphones.  I use them every day and just love this product!  I am also impressed at the customer service JLab Audio provides.  They really do care about their customer and making their products better.  Thumbs up to JLab Audio and the new J3's!  This is one of the best purchases I have made this year!

J-Buds continues to deliver excellent value
My first impression of the J-Buds J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones was that they were surprisingly lightweight, almost delicate. The cord is thinner and has a different coating than one typically sees with most earphones. According to the manufacturer it is supposed to be better in regards to durability and in the week that I tested them, I found them to be quite resilient. They fit very snugly into my ear, which was impressive, as I've often had an issue with previous earphones falling out with the slightest snag. The manufacturer provides four sizes ear cushions rather than the customary three, which is very much appreciated. As was the case with pervious J-Bud models, these required some breaking in time. I let them play for a few hours on both an iPod and iPhone before making my analysis. The J3'sprovide excellent sound isolation; something I take seriously as I primarily use these while riding the subway in New York. Good sound isolation means you can listen to your music at a lower level rather than turning the volume up to compensate for outside sources. It's something I had really enjoyed with the J2 model and is further improved upon here. Those J2s were a comfortable, dramatically inexpensive improvement over the stock headphones provided with Apple's iPod; they had a great range of volume along with that impressive sound isolation but suffered at the high end. I think that JLab Audio attempted to react to that last criticism with this model, which is notably brighter. I can certainly hear items in recordings that I previously could not. It's a pretty crisp sound. Still, while perhaps arguable by another ear, I felt it wasn't a completely balanced a sound. It needs a tab bit more bass. Perhaps that is something that will be achieved with additional breaking in of the model. Still, even with that gripe, you have to applaud JLab Audio's J3's. They are simply a great value for the overall quality they offer at this price point. I found them to be better than the popular Bose In-Ear and just about comparable with the Sennheiser cx300 and Klipsch Image S4, all available at 2-3 times the J3's price.

Great earbuds.
First of let me say that I have recently bought a J2 about 3 weeks ago. Those were great, but I gave them to my brother since I've got the J3.<br /><br />At first, I thought the reviews about the j3s sounding too trebly were correct. I was extremely disappointed, but I gave it a chance since I haven't burned it in yet. <br />After 3 hours, there was not much improvement. I was losing my hope in these earphones because my J2s were much better sounding.<br />It was only after I tried adjusting the ear foams that I discovered my mistake.<br />The standard size was the best fit for me, so using that ear piece, I tried twisting the earbuds into my ears instead.<br />To my own surprise, the sound became extremely rich. I tested it again, but this time with my normal way of placing in my earbuds, and the trebleness returned.<br /><br />You've probably read a lot of reviews saying that the sound of the j3 is too trebly and weak. Discard them from your mind. I hate to say this but it's not the earbud's fault but our own. To experience the full sounds of this great bud, you HAVE to put it really into your ears. So much that it literally cuts off the sounds of a person talking.<br /><br />Now, onto the review now that we clarified the trebly sound mistakes :].<br /><br />Sound: These buds are amazing once you place them in your ears correctly (shove it all the way in.) The sound is rich and clear. Of course, I haven't fully burned them in yet, and I can hear the earphones get better every hour or so. But still, even without a full burn in, it sounds surprisingly good. Even better than my j2s which have been used extensively for a couple of weeks now. Now, I'm not a super major audiophile, but I do know that my ears are very good at hearing sounds. I have to say, running my music through these earphones with my computer sound cards settings at 24 bit and 192000hz is just great. The sound comes out clear, basses with enough "oofmp" and trebles with enough clarity. I repeat again, this is when the earpphones are not fully burned it yet.<br /><br />Design and build: This is the sexiest and coolest looking earbuds I've seen. Much better than those of ipods and zunes, and I like it's shape better than shures. Basically, the shape just screams high end production and quality. The earbuds are quite small, and the cable seems quite thin. However, this just all adds into its appeal. The shiny aluminum, the sleek black aluminum shell, and the see through cable, (along with the laser etched logos) all look great. There's great attention to design because even the cable looks attractive.<br />Other than looks, the build seems extremely solid. Although the cable takes a bit to straighten out, it's very durable and stiff despite it's thinness. The wire is a little on the short side though (well it doesn't really matter because I haven't found a time where i needed to be more than 4 feet from my music player.) The connection areas are very well done too. Especially the plugin part. It's gold plated for greater quality, and the plastic covering for the area is small but strong and well made. There's a Y split adjuster too, it's a little short for my taste but that's fine.<br /><br />I also like that Jbuds put a metal mesh over the earhole of the buds to keep stuff from entering. It's a great improvement from the j2s. It also looks great.<br /><br />The buds come with 4 sizes, and each of these can change the perception of the sound quality. So you have to test them all if you want to find the best one for you.<br /><br />Other than that, this comes with a spiffy casing. It's small and easy to use. It takes a bit of time to figure how to put the buds in, but I found it really easy if you wrap your bud around 3 of your fingers and then place it into the container.<br />I love this addition because not many other companies offer a case with their buds.<br /><br />Now that you know my impressions, feel free to judge these buds yourself. I'm pretty sure that you'll love em.<br />Also, it's Jlabs offer a great website, and their burn in test there seems to be very good, so give it a try when you get these buds.

New to the High-End Earbud Market
Before using J3's, I had no real conception of the difference between a low-end and high-end earphone.  My best set of earphones was a cheap Philips pair that I bought at Best Buy. Therefore, I'll try to cater this review to others considering the transition into the high-end earphone market, who have never owned a well-built earphone.<br /><br />If you're currently using a low-end earphone, I highly recommend upgrading to the J3's.  When compared to low-end earphones, these have several distinguishing features:<br /> - The rubber tips form a seal in your ear to enable high-quality low end frequencies.  That is, you can actually hear really deep bass if you're wearing the earphones correctly.  In order to ensure correct fit, JBuds includes four rubber tips so you can custom fit them to your ear.<br /> - The materials are much higher-quality - the phones themselves have an aluminum body and the cord feels much stiffer than low-end earphones.<br /> - You can't hear anything outside the earphones.  This can be good or bad, depending on how you plan to use them, but for the most part, I would say this is a very positive feature.  However, if you move your head around you can hear rustling as the cord rubs on your clothing.  I assume this would be typical for any noise-isolating earphone, though.<br /> - The case is very well-designed.  It's compact and doesn't crush the earphones if pressure is applied.  If you haven't used a round case like this, it might seem awkward trying to fit everything into it.  The trick, however, is to lightly wrap the cord around your ring, middle, and index fingers and then put everything in the case.<br /> - These require a burn-in period in order to get the best sound.  When I first started using these, the high-frequencies seemed really harsh, but this problem disappeared after a week or so of listening.  The change in sound quality is very noticeable after the burn-in period.  After a bit of research, it looks like JBuds actually has sounds on their site specifically designed to burn in these earphones.<br /><br />The frustration-free packaging is very nice.  The box that these ship in is about the size of a 3x5 index card and the thickness of two iPods, so everything comes neat and well-organized.<br /><br />So far, I haven't been able to find any real drawbacks to these earphones.  They seem very well built, and the music quality is great.  I would highly recommend these.<br /><br />This is my first-ever Amazon review, so let me know if I've missed anything in the comments.

Really very good.
(Please see my update at the end of this review.)<br /><br />I looked at a LOT of reviews before I made this decision, especially the one- and two-star ones. Grousing is often instructive.<br /><br />I can't claim to be an audiophile, nor a purist for music; but I like it when my music isn't grating or tinny, and I like it when my earbuds aren't digging into my ears and making them ache. I'm looking at you, Apple. Why spend so much time and effort perfecting something like the iPod when you release such crappy, uncomfortable earbuds? Seems a little like making a perfect restaurant, with five-star service, superb ambiance, and extremely helpful waitstaff - then selling your patrons $20 plates filled with roadkill.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not an audiophile, but I like it when things work, and sound good. These earbuds do it. The silicone plungers seat nicely in my ears - hard to do, since I have an allergy that normally makes them itch like fire when I insert listening apparatus - and they do isolate sound, except the occasional sussurations of my own hands on the cable. I guess that's to be expected.<br /><br />I'm using them before the J-Labs recommended 24- to 48-hour burn in, but I like them so far. Trebles are a bit too crisp sometimes, but bass response is excellent. I believe the trebles will smooth out with time. (Here's a question for J-Labs, though: If you know your buds need a break-in, well, why not do it in the factory before you ship them?)<br /><br />Currently Bach is playing, the Brandenburg set performed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000J2PP">Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment</a>. I like that I can hear the valves opening and closing on the woodwinds, and that I can hear the players breathing as they perform. My sold-with-the-unit iPhone earbuds were not this sensitive. And nowhere near as comfortable.<br /><br />I was surprised by one thing, though. I was under the impression that these buds had an inline mic and controller for handling phone calls and iTunes playback, like the Apple buds. Apparently not.<br /><br />Anyway, a good set of buds, and with the current markdown ($30 from $70 as of November 09), worth the cash, or so I think. Certainly a marked improvement over the buds you get with your iPod/iPhone.<br /><br />==== UPDATE 25 January 2010: =====<br /><br />As anticipated, after the break-in period, the buds are delivering sterling audio performance. Trebles have mellowed, midranges are crisp; but what I think I like most is that the bass response is still very much there. It's bizarre to describe earbuds as having "resonant" bass -- after all, they don't have the drivers to be subwoofers -- but these little guys really deliver. There are times when I can almost feel my head resonating. I'm quite pleased with this purchase.

A must wear, hear, use, and buy
JLab has presented a great product. Comfort, sound quality, durability, and affordability in order are the variables I use to choose earphones.  The J3s excel in all variables which translate to success in my view.<br />The level of comfort provided by the earpieces is unexpected and on par with pricier earphones.  I wear mine sometimes for eight to nine hours a day.  Sound quality is superb.  The highs and lows have been engineered to sound as they should; crystal clear with rich tones for treble, midranges, and bass.  No attribute overwhelms, but all are extremely impressive.  Durability is a must and the J3s deliver.  I twist; pull, and crush wires during my work day (by accident of course) and the J3s have remained resilient.  The no tangle/no kink wire casing has played a major role in the survival of these earphones for me and I'm sure will continue to keep them healthy for some time to come.  The price point for these earphones is a steal.  They are deserving of a heftier price.  I am grateful to JLab for making this quality of earphone available at this price.<br />The only con if it indeed is a con I have about the earphones is that right and left earpieces are not marked (at least not on my set).  It has not made a difference in my listening pleasure and may have made the task of placing the earpieces in my ear easier.  I don't have to hunt for the little R and the little L.  <br />

Glad I gave them a second chance!
This was my original review:<br />"Found these to have WAY to much treble and not enough bass. To be honest I though they sounded terrible. I know the J2's had complaints about lack of highs unfortunately they went way overboard here. I returned them after getting a splitting headache in 15 minutes of using them."<br /><br />Now for the update:<br /><br />After placing this review I was contacted by Jlab. They were very friendly and asked if I would give them a second chance. It was possible that I had a defective pair. I'm glad I did! The second pair was sent directly from them. Using the included "Standard" eartips I still felt they had too much treble and were week in the Bass. This eliminated the bad pair theory. Luckily they also included a different style of double flanged eartips. I was told these where a new design. Skeptical at this point I gave them a try. Almost instantly, I was blown away at the difference they made. The treble was toned down perfectly and the bass was smooth and just right. Even today, I can't believe what a difference they make. I don't know if they bring the driver closer in or what but they did it for me. I'm a believer!<br />I would also like to thank Matt and JLab for sticking behind their product. I was given some of THE BEST customer service one could ask for. Because of that I would have given there next bud J4? a try regardless of the outcome with the J3's. Fortunately, the J3's are here to stay. I love them!<br /><br />

Great quality for a great price!
I've never had or tried any of the JBuds or other products by JLabs so i was very skeptical about these, today i got these and overall the build quality is very good, actually the main body is made out of aluminum so they are light weight too. <br />The plug is 3.5mm and is gold plated, and the wire is nice and durable.<br />The sound is amazing for the price you pay, very nice detailed and clear highs with deep lows, the bass is very punchy when it needs to be, not muddy at all. Very nice sound for almost all genres of music.<br />I think the J3 are one of the best at this price range. They don't have a mic or any button control from what i know right now.<br /><br />They come in a very nice compact cardboard box that is a "frustration free packaging" and i love that! The J3 include a very small rounded hard carry case and 4 other silicone tip sizes. <br /><br />I managed to get good sound isolation with the normal tips, however the J3 do not claim to be sound isolation In-Ears..

Excellent earbuds.
I was somewhat unsure about purchasing the J-3 earbuds after so many reviews spoke of poor bass response, but decided to take a chance.  They arrived today and were plugged in and tried out immediately to get a baseline before breaking them in.  Two things were immediately noticed.  First, it was necessary to lower volume levels on both my iPod and computer well below levels used on other headphones or earbuds to get a comfortable listening level.  These are really sensitive.  Second, my fears concerning bass response were unfounded. In fact, I turned off the 'bass booster' setting on my iPod and went to the 'deep' setting as the bass was over emphasized.  A variety of music ranging from rock to classical was played with excellent results.  Bass lines came through very well whether strings, electronic or vocal.  Mids and highs are just<br />as well reproduced.  As others have said music that just isn't there with other earbuds is there with the J-3's.<br /><br />Perhaps others are comparing these to earbuds or headphone costing ten or twenty time as much as these.  Or it is possible that other's hearing differs and lends a different perception of the sound.  Or perhaps those giving a negative rating received a lemon.  For myself, I find no problems with the J-3's performance.  If these improve with break in as claimed they are going to be fantastic.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am very satisfied.<br /><br />The only negative immediately noticeable is the amount of noise transmitted to the earpiece when the cables are moved or bumped.  I find that looping the cables over my ears tends to isolate the noise. Possibly the manufacturer could engineer better isolation where the cable enters the bud body.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Comfortable, Good Sound, Good Service
I have nothing but praise for these earphones. Since I am not an audio expert, I will leave that area to the other expert reviews already posted here. <br /><br />My very small ears have made finding comfortable in-ear earphones very difficult. These do not fit perfectly in my ears [nothing in existence will], but they come the closest of any earphones I have ever used. They fit well enough to stay in my ears while walking fast on rough ground and to provide excellent acoustics for music and voice. JLabs provides an array of silicone cups in a variety of sizes to attach to the earphones. <br /><br />Furthermore, one of the silicone cups broke soon after I bought the earphones. JLabs provided truly extraordinary service when I asked them about buying a replacement. They do not sell the tiny size in their replacement cups package, so they sent me a pair gratis. <br /><br />Added after trying the pair of cups JLabs sent me: they fit my tiny ears absolutely perfectly. This is the size for anyone with tiny ears. Thank you JLab - I didn't think it could be done. <br /><br />This is a company that truly stands behind their product. <br /><br />

Best earbuds I've owned
First let me state that all the low-rating complaints about bass, treble and tin problems are absolutely true - if you never take the time to figure out how the things are supposed to be worn. These require that you choose the correctly sized cover (4 different options are included), and fit them snugly inside your ear. Let them dangle like you would other earbuds, and they won't sound as good because they're not designed to work that way.<br /><br />Once you get it right, the sound is of immense quality. Bass is deep, and can even be too much at high volumes. The mids come off very slightly scooped on some tracks, but not enough to complain when you're talking about earbuds. The highs are as crisp as you could want them to be. <br /><br />The best part about them is that they let you listen to the music and nothing else. I've never gotten even a hint of cord noise, and, using the proper cover for my ear size, I can't hear people talking right next to me. Even just this morning I noticed a faint background track on a song I've listened to 100 times before, and that was at half volume on an iPod while standing on the 8th Ave. sidewalk in NYC. At the same volume, you barely hear an incoming subway train while standing on the platform.<br /><br />I've had literally hundreds of different pairs of headphones: Bose, Koss, SennHeiser, Ultrasone, Beyerdynamic, you name it. Put these J-labs up against any other earbuds, and they win every time. And for this price, there really isn't a question of choice.<br /><br />Plus, these completely make up for their lackluster J1 and J2 sets.

Coustomer Service Lives
I use my laptop every day to watch movies and listen to music. When I got a gift certificate for xmas from my brother I decided to invest in a decent set of headphones for the laptop so that I may have a more enjoyable experience. Like many of us I was using a cheap set of ipod headphones with my laptop but was disappointed with the mediocre sound that they produce. I was very excited when I received my J3's and plugged them in right away only to find that I was unable to get a proper fit from the included tips. I tried them all but no luck. <br /><br />After burning the J3's in for a few days I tried again and still could not get a good fit. So I decided to try to let Jlab fix my issue. After several helpful emails to them the issue was finally resolved by sending me out a different type of tip for them. I was simply amazed at the difference. The bass was deep and clean (well as clean as Ministry playing Just one Fix can be) and the treble was clear without sounding too bright. <br /><br />In short even if these ear-buds do not fit quite right do not send them back let Jlab show you how good their customer support is and make it right for you as well.

Little Champ-Thumbs up to Jlabs designers
A bit of background about me...I am an active musician, play the bass, piano and drums, have a recording studio at home with high end Audio Technica m50 monitor headphones which I always use as reference. I can say that my ears are generally trained to pick music. With that out of the way....I have never owned in ear headphones before and did not have any idea of how they would sound. I needed a set to take with me to the gym and since these were cheap and had pretty good reviews decided to go with them. Got them a couple of days back, put them through the torture test..maybe 3 hours so far, plan to keep listening along with the burn in to hear the changes. So put them in my ear and started listening. The ear tips it shipped with were comfortable, but i tried one size smaller and it was perfect. <br /><br />Now to the interesting part of the sound. These are the tracks i use to put on my reference system and also test most of the audio equipment when listening. Hans Zimmer's Soundtrack from Batman Begins has one of the mind numbing lows and highs present in it. Reading all the reviews put together on this earphones I expected that I would be hearing ear tearing highs and no lows till the end of the break in period...My My... Was I in for a surprise.The bass exceeded my expectations and i could actually feel the cello, synth bass, drums thundering inside my head and the highs actually were the ones that were lacking to me. i think it is unfair to compare a 30$ earphone with a 100$ monitor headphone, but these were actually putting out sound that would make me want to compare them.<br /><br />I thght maybe i need to try something else. This time around I adjusted the fit inside my ear where I pushed them to get a good seal and then pulled them out a bit. vocals are important in recordings cos they form the bulk of the lower and upper midrange. What better artist than Enya. Searched for her on Pandora and they played me Anywhere is..excellent projection of vocals and the strings in background. The earphones did a very good job and had a better balance this time around. Final torture test was from Diana Kralls- The very best of Diana Krall.This is one of the best collections of her songs. The presentation that the earphones gave me was astounding for their price. I was getting the same musical experience I have heard from high end floor standers that have 8 or 10 inch woofers, incredible job by the Jlab folks.<br /><br /> cannot believe the performance I am getting from these. It took me some playing around with the fit and once I got them fitting right they excelled big time. Buy them and make sure you use the right tip to get the best sound.

Great buy!
I tend to buy mid level headphones/earbuds (20-50$). I prefer having higher sound quality over the "free" ipod buds. Still, I can't justify spending more for earbuds than I did for my ipod, especially when the lifespan of electronics in my house (between my toddler and the cat) is about 6 months. I am no audiophile, but the J3's are far better than anything I've ever bought. As others have mentioned, the high notes are a little harsh before the "burn in" period. Even without the "burn in", these headphones stand out in every way. <br /><br />After opening the package, my first impression was how light these felt. The body is a solid piece of metal and feels very sturdy. The cord looks woven, but covered in a translucent rubber coating that seems strong. They form a seamless seal in my ear. Even though these aren't marketed as "noise canceling" they block out noise pretty well. I share an office with a "loud talker" that spends a good part of the day on the phone and these help a lot. <br /><br />Several other reviews mention that these cause excessive rubbing noise, due to the stiffness of the cord and the seal formed with the ear. However, I find this to be no worse than other earphones. I might be a bit biased here, as the earphones that these are replacing (due to failure) are the Altec Lansing earphones with the cloth cord. The friction-related noise was unbearable at times. <br /><br />I wouldn't pay ~80$ (listed as the retail price), but these are an amazing buy at 30$. <br />

Damm !!Now thts a new fish in the pond!!!!
Its my first ever review and i feel proud writing it for this amazing product. The sound quality is great and the wire doesn't tangle. These two were my top priorities. I tried this earphone with metal , opera, hip hop, its perfect for all songs.The case seems to be solid and also has a nice finish. The product comes with four different sizes and they are pretty fit and soft at the same time. ONE important point that i want to mention is that some really high quality listeners might feel a bit problem like bass and stuff is great. I feel there is a slight extra treble in these earphones rest is just perfect. It might be that my song quality might not be that good thats why i am getting slightly more treble.The packing by amazon is also great. And i am really rocking along with these earphones in my ears!!! and finally guys the best thing in the market for $29.99 and they ROCK!!!!!!

Money well spent
These earbuds are top-notch, the fit and in-ear comfort was excellent as was the all-important sound quality. The bass was rich but not over-powering. Definitely would buy these again.

Worth every penny and more
I have been searching for inexpensive yet quality headphones for a few years. I have kids that are getting into the music scene, but not responsible enough to be trusted with an expensive pair of headphones. <br /><br />I tried a few of the ~10 dollar sets. All were better than the headphones that came with the MP3 players, but none were great. I purchased a set of Sennheiser on sale for $30, but the quality was not significantly better than the $10 Coby's.<br /><br />This year for Christmas, my 14 year old son was begging for a nice pair of headphones. I did some research, and decided to get the JBuds J3. Reviews indicated they were much better in quality than the $10 headphones, and the price ($24) won't kill me when he loses or breaks them after a few months. <br /><br />After they arrived, I pulled them out to give them a try before I wrapped them for Christmas.<br /><br />They definitely had a 'tinny' sound right out of the box, but that was the only negative. <br /><br />My biggest complaint with cheap headphones is the blending of sounds in the higher ranges and the tendency to make high pitched vocals sound like a screech. The JBuds J3, right out of the box, were fabulous in producing clean and clear sound in the high and mid ranges. No screeching voices, and very distinct and separate sounds in all ranges. I was in awe at how clearly I could hear the music.<br /><br />I read on JBuds website that a break-in period was required, so I hooked these headphones up to my computer for three nights and played music at a moderate volume. After three days there was a noticable difference. The tinny sound was pretty much gone, and the overall sound improved slightly (it was already great).<br /><br />I own a pair of over the ear Sony's that I purchased for about $55 a few years back, and a pair of noise cancelling Audio-Technica I paid about $120 for 2 years ago. Both produce great sound, but the JBuds J3 exceed both in the high ranges. (I would highly recommend the Audio-Technica for anyone looking for noise-cancelling. They are great on flights and in noise environments)<br /><br />The JBuds J3 reproduce excellent balanced sound across the entire range. For the price, these are a steal.<br /><br />After finishing my tests, I wrapped the JBuds up for my son, and ordered a pair for myself.<br /><br />To address complaints I have read from others:<br />1. Poor base: The base on these are excellent. It is clean base that balances with the sounds across all the other ranges. If you like base that thumps and drowns out the rest of the music, these may not be for you. If you like base that is strong and clear and enhances the overall music experience, but not overbearing, these are great. That being said, when I turn the base all the way up on my Sony Walkman, these headphones thump without killing the other ranges. <br />2. There is a tinny sound: There is a 'treble' tendency on these. I typically turn the higher ranges up in the equalizer settings, with these I leave the equalizer on my Sony almost flat. On my wife's ipod, I have to customize the settings to get the best sound. Every device produces different sound quality. If you unplug your old headphones and plug these in without altering the equalizer settings (especially right out of the package) they will sound 'tinny'. Give them 24 hours break-in and adjust your equalizer and they will sound phenomenal.<br />

Top-notch reproduction
I have always wondered what a two hundred dollar pair of earbuds would sound like, but now I don't care.  These J3s are incredible.  It takes more volume to power them than other buds (moderate volume is close to max volume on my Archos 5) but the sound is startling.  The bass is tight and defined.  If it is on the recording, you will hear it.  The highs are more crisp and clear than any other earbud I have tried.  I simply haven't heard music with this much clarity in years.  If you like muddy, booming bass that probably wasn't on the recording, you won't like these.  If you like the full range and every nuance, buy them!<br />And don't even try to listen to them until you've broken them in at their website!  This is more of a necessity than any other earbuds I've owned.

Great price and great sound quality.
I just ordered both the J2 and J3.  J2 for when I head to the gym since the price is low so I won't cry if I kill it.  And the J3 is for at home or at work during breaks.  The J2 seemed to have a muddy sound with some good bass, not the greatest.  But as soon as my J3 came in and first thing I did was play a techno song just to hear the highs and lows, and it sounds way better!! Cleanest highs and solid bass for an earbud, and I kind of think it beats my Bose over the ears.. The size of the buds are small and comfy.  These will replace my old Sony earbuds immediately.  I suggest going for the J3 over the big and muddy J2.

Best earphones ... EVER!
I've used plenty of earphones in my day.  I've used headphones, I've had the ones shaped like circles that you have to stick in your ear (with our without that piece that wraps around your ears), and I've used big MONSTER headphones that look like those ones that plane traffic engineers use.<br /><br />Never have I had a pair of earphones that are as comfortable as these.  Many times, you get those earphones that you stick in your ear and they are VERY uncomfortable.  Not so with these.  They are so gentle.  Comfort aside, these earphones are EXCELLENT.  I can't hear a thing when I have them both on (which I think is a BIG PLUS).  And the sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />And you just can't beat the price for earphones of this size and quality.  I highly recommend them.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
$20 sound at a $6 price, plus decent noise cancellation and comfortable to wear.
<br />It would be unfair to compare these earphones to the some other more expensive earphones I own like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CE1UO">Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176TEGM">Philips SHE9850 In-Ear Headphones with Advanced Acoustics</a>. The Coby earphones cannot reproduce the highs and lows as faithfully as those earphones in the sub $100 range. However,you get good sound for a tiny fraction of the cost of the high end earphones.<br /><br />Sound Quality: <br />The Coby earphones compare very favorably to the in earphones in the sub $25 range like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G35RYK">Philips SHE9500 Ultra Sound In Ear Headphones</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68BD4">JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (White)</a>. The sound of these Coby earphones is decent, they also have good bass and pretty good noise reduction. The noise reduction is not as great as some of the sub $100 earphones I have used but is good enough for listening on a plane ride. This is probably the best noise reduction you can get in the sub $20 range!<br /><br />Comfort: <br />These are one of the more comfortable in ear phones I've owned. The flex rubber sleeves are thinner than usual and fit comfortably in the ear. I can wear them for hours without feeling any discomfort. They also don't fall out which is a big plus. The only in ear headphone that was more comfortable than these is the Philips SE9850 that came with memory foam sleeves that molds to fit your ears.<br /><br />Make:<br />The make of these earphones is ok. The cord is quite thin and does have a tendency to tangle a bit. When you get them you have to tear apart the cord as per your preference, there is a little plastic sleeve midway to ensure you don't end up tearing them all the way down. They did seem a bit flimsy to me but in 2 months of use these earphones have held up quite well. And seriously, even if they do get damaged after a few months  it will take only $5 to replace them. <br /><br />Overall: <br />If you're like me and like to have more than one earphone lying around, this is a great product. After I lost my $100 Shures when they fell out of my pocket, I prefer to take these with me for more active trips. They sound good, don't fall out of my ears and hold up well to moderately rough use...and if I lose them, no big deal...just get a new pair.

you will throw away your old ones
i bought more earphones than pair of shoes the last 5 years including really expensive ones for $100. Curious about the good ranking here at Amazon and the cheap price i just ordered one set of Coby earphones. To make it short: these are better than everything i tried before. The sound is full, smooth and fantastic. I could write more, just go ahead and get one. You won't regret it.

Great More than Bargained for!
These earphones are just as loud as any overly priced ipod earphones and are even better. They have the best bass with clear voices so you dont just hear a thrashing noise with barely any singing in the background,also one important thing I almost forgot was that they are LOUD. <br />Now sound volume is an important factor for people who go through busy streets,bus and train passagers, or even joggers(sweat resistant) who want to block out the outside noises from disturbing them.It completly closes you in to only your music and can even be hard to realize when someone is calling you. <br />I was suprised to get such a great pair of earphones for such a cheap price. I am really pleased with them and if you buy them you definetly will too.

Excellent sound.
I bought these earphones based on the reviews, and they work really well. You get good quality at low volumes, when "regular" earphones would give you a very low, subdued sound. They work fine not only for bass, but also for the mid and high frequency ranges. I've discovered sounds and beats that I dind't know existed in some of the songs I have in storage.<br /><br />I don't know if they are Bose quality, but i didn't expected that either. They are just much better than your regular everyday earbuds, and you can't beat that for 9 dollars. Way to go, Colby!

Earbuds are not forever
I dare you to find a person who is still using his/her original earbuds. (or even their second or third pair.) Regardless of price, the things get lost, get tangled, get wet, get stepped on, etc. Thus, I'm always looking for ear buds that will stay in my ears, produce acceptable sound for activities outdoors where there's ambient noise, and survive routine use. If I want concert hall sound, I'll go to a concert hall or at least sit quietly in my living room with a big pair of Bose over my ears. For the price, these are really hard to beat.

Tell your audiophile buddy you paid a hundred bucks for these 'phones and tell him to give them a listen.  He'll say they sound great and you got a bargain.  Then tell him they were under $10 and they're made by Coby!  I'm going to stock up on these for sure.

Very Nice
I love these headphones. I used to have horrible luck with headphones. I could never hear anything unless they were really loud. Not wth these. They are almost like ear plugs. You can barely hear anything other than the music and its great. The sound is really good, you don't have to have the volume way up to hear the music. You cannot find better headphones for the price.

Very Nice Earphones
I'm surprised at the quality of these earphones. After about 20 hours of break-in time the frequency response is very good. Bass is getting better as I use them. I wear them mainly at work. I work in a noisy environment and though not perfect at noise canceling (I work in a metal fabrication shop) they sound good at low volumes. I'm able to wear them the full 8 hour day with no fatigue. I can't do that with the ear plugs provided at work.

The Super Bass digital is SUPER
It is so much better than the pair that came with the Nano, First, you do not have to put up with those worthless earpiece covers. They do not fall off, you do not have to crawl on your hands and knees to find them when they drop off. Second and probably more important,they fit and stay in my ears. The set that came with the Nano would fall out of my ears when I moved my head. Finally, the sound is fine also. I am glad I purchased them.<br /> <br />

A long review...
Wow.  I've tried many headphones, including iPod ones, and this was the BEST deal I have ever gotten.  Have you ever tried using your iPod earbuds, and smash them up to your ears and the bass seems really good?  Well this is what you get, but BETTER.  And best of all, you don't have to smash them into your ear!<br /><br />I've had these earphones for a day now, and there great.  The bass is fantastic, and so is sound quality.  Beats iPod earbuds.  I got these for 6 dollars, just 6, and they say WAY better then the iPod standard ones.  And they cost 30 dollars!  I would HIGHLY recommend someone that has a budget on earbuds but wants a REALLY good deal, just get these.  Just get them.<br /><br />As far as sound isolation, I am not sure for buses, but just for your standard home, its great.  I put these on, and when I was watching t.v. I had my iPod on, and I was listening to some quiet music and I could not focus on my t.v.  It was even on volume 10, which is pretty loud, and I could still not focus on it.  These strictly will make you focus on your music, or whatever your trying to listen to on your iPod.<br /><br />Last thing, for the fit, I don't know about you guys, but it fit me fine.  I firstly tried to stick it in straight into my ear though, but it didn't work.  So what you have to do is turn it at an angle, put it in your ear, then make it straight.  Not a lot of force into it, just give it a little push, and it's in!  It stays in your ear, whether your running or walking, because I've tried.  Also, the silicone tips look pretty durable, and they stay on well, so don't worry about them breaking anytime soon.  Just make sure to avoid putting them in your pocket when you can, so they can last you a while.<br /><br />Overall, I am VERY pleased with these, these are WAY better then the iPod ones, and I got them for 6 dollars, NEW!  And last thing for fits, I tried them on, they were fine, I had my mom and dad try them, they were fine, AND I had my brother try them, and he's 8 years old, and they were great.  These will pretty much fit into anyones ears.  This is a really good deal, so get it ASAP!!!<br /><br />This is my review, hope you enjoyed reading it.<br />Sincerely, <br />Kevin.

Better Sound Than I Expected
I was quite happy with these earphones, if you don't get them pushed into your ear far enough you won't get the quality sound, if you're wanting to go cheap and still get good sound, this is it.

Brilliant sound if inserted correctly
The frequency range and volume output is simply amazing. I've tried many different head phones and this is by far my best pair. I also have one of those studio "ear muff" head phones which cost $200 dollars and this $5 pair, although not better, is very similar in terms of sound quality. Be sure to insert them correctly or else some sounds may sound muffled or just weird.<br /><br />My final thought is this is the best $5-$10 you'll ever spend.

Terrific!
I didn't like earbuds type earphones but I decided to try this one. It's A+. The sound is wonderful and, when I jog, they don't come out of my ears. I guarantee: they're excellent.

Very good sound quality, low price, get them
COMFORT:<br />When I first put them on, wow, they fit very well and sealed very good. I rate comfort 9/10. -1 point because if I wear them for 6-8 hours, the top back part of my ear presses slightly against the hard inside part of the ear cups, not really a big problem. I can fix this somewhat by changing the position of the ear cups on my ears. That's the only bad part about the comfort. You won't notice it until after a few hours of use.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY:<br />Overall frequency response is about flat. And just enough bass that it doesn't sound lacking, but not too much, just the right amount. You can listen to these for a long time and fall asleep without being fatigued from the sound.<br /><br />TREBLE:<br />I tested the headphones on my computer frequency generator. There was a very slight, hardly noticeable (1-2dB) peak at 2.5kHz (the driver resonance), and another peak of about the same amount at 7kHz (natural resonance of the ear canal). I used the equalizer in winamp for flattest sound, but later after listening to music while switching it on and off, decided that the difference in sound quality was so small that I didn't need to use an equalizer. The overall sound has a kind of mellow sound to the treble, like a low wide peak from 400-2000, it doesn't sound perfectly flat. <br /><br />BASS:<br />The bass extends to about 30Hz (-3dB point), while sounding more full and effortless at 40Hz. If they're played below 40Hz, the bass has some odd harmonic distortion starting from 35Hz and a lot more below that. (This is because the Sound Mode valve does not completely cover the bass port inside the ear cups). The bass below 32Hz can still be heard, but with little of the fundamental frequency and most of the odd order harmonics. The lowest audible frequency  these can play is 27Hz. (My Koss EarPlug earphones can audibly play to 10Hz.) This is the only bad thing about the bass extension, but only for people that play super loud, super deep bass. When some bass is played at low volume, you can't hear much below 60Hz. This is how it's been with every hedphone i've had. It's normal.<br /><br />OTHER:<br />The headphones have a switch at the bottom of the ear cups labeled 'Sound Mode'. All this switch does is cover (not completely) or uncover the bass port inside the ear cups. Music Mode covers the bass port for less bass boost, and Movie Mode uncovers it, adding only a slight about of bass, hardly noticeable. If you're using these as studio monitors, you'll want to have the switch set to Music Mode. One more thing is about the cord. It's very long (11.66 feet long!! I measured it :D ). Longest headphone cord I've ever known. You'll have no problem walking from one side of the room to the other without unplugging or taking off the headphones. Being so long, it does get tangled when you put away the headphones. The simple solution is to just wrap the wire into a coil and tie it with a twisty tie, simple.  These are ok at blocking outside noise, while still being able to hear someone talk to you. These headphones have a rated power handling capacity of 1500mW. With a sensitivity of 102dB/mW and a maximum power handling of 1500mW, these can get up to 135dB in you ears. These headphones have Long Stroke drivers. All my other headphones distort when i turn them up very loud with a lot of bass, but these headphones can take a lot of bass without distorting (clicking sound of the driver diaphragm hitting the plastic).<br /><br />OVERALL RATING:<br />I rate these headphones 9/10, excellent, but not perfect.<br />I recommend these to anyone, even professionals.<br />These are professional quality studio monitor headphones.<br />You can't go wrong with these. Super value.<br />Get them, you will not be disappointed.

Best earphones for eyeglass wearers
This review is aimed at those with eyeglasses and whose ears get pinched between the eyeglass arms and the earphones. I do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns. I have bought and used these:<br />Sony MDR-CD230<br />Sony MDR-V6<br />Sony MDR-XD200<br />My ears are not real fussy on quality, nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts, usually after 10-20 minutes of listening. My hatsize if about 7.25,<br />my ears are pretty normal in size, I am middle aged. All three of these headphones I own are the best I have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past 2 years. Headphones have a left and right side - the cord typically is attached to the left side, and the ear spaces, or cups, are oriented accordingly, to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe. The sideways pressure (how hard they clamp onto your head) also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt. I wear wireframe glasses, and my use for headphones is background music while I program.<br /><br />$30 The CD230 is no longer available, that I could find (Fall 2006), and I've used them for 5 years. They hurt my ears after 3-4 hours of continual use, but are good before that. They have cloth covered ear cushions, and relatively deep ear lobe spaces. This feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not. If you can find these, and like cloth covered headphones, you won't be unhappy. The sideways pressure is light for me.<br /><br />$64 The V6 stands out for 2 things - richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises. Listening to classical music, not real loud, a co-worker can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well. (Women's voices too). Overheard conversations are not overheard.<br />I have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my ears/head get sore after 1-2 hours. The sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two, but not excessive. They are well cushioned, with soft fake thin leather-like vinyl which I did not find causes sweating at all. But there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit, and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably I am sure. If I did not have my eyeglasses on, then these are very comfortable.<br /><br /><br />$26 The XD200 is a little lighter than the V6, it does not block out outside noises as well, which can be a benefit in the office because I can hear co-workers calling my name. The sideways pressure is light, the cushion is the same thickneess as the V6 but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe, so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones I've owned or tried. The cushions are covered in the thin leather-like vinyl like the V6 - this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic, it feels dry, not clammy. To my unprofessional ears the sound is great. If you wear eyeglasses, don't want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch, then I think you will be happiest with the Sony MDR-XD200 headphones.

Great Product, Great Price.

<!-- BOUNDARY -->
You can't beat the price and the sound
I search for a while for a decent pair of moderately priced headphones.  I came to these and I am glad I did.  The sound is great and they fit nicely.  The only issue I have is that they don't fold flat and they have a lot of plastic that appears that it might break easy but just got them and no signs of yet of this being a problem. <br /><br />Also one suggestion to Sony and others.  Make the cable changeable.  What i mean is allo it to detach and include both a long cable and a short cable.  This way you won't have a lot of excess cable when you only need a little.<br /><br />Overall very very please.

Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones
Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones<br /><br />I listen to music all day long at work. I really like the 10 foot cord. The sound is crisp and clear. I can really crank the volume up and the other people around me cannot hear what I am listening too at the volume that I am listening to. They are big and bulky no doubt but I will take that for the clarity of sound that I get. The Treble and Bass frequences come across clear. I have not noticed a differences in the Sound/Movie feature. I get all the Highs and Lows. The Sound Quality is almost as good as the Custom Bulit Bose system in my Truck. I have also used these Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones for Gaming and the quality of sound does not change at all. <br /><br />They are well made and sturdy. Some people complain about it hurts after a few hours, my opinion of what they say is; I weared my Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones for approx 11 hours a day by 5 days a week., I have not problem with the comfort and they do not hurt. <br /><br />Kudos to Sony for the Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones. I love them.

Very very nice.
I've had these headphones for about a week and a half and have used them a lot. I don't really agree with the "discomfort" reviews. I've dealt with painful headphones that pinch hairs and are too tight and have earcups too small, etc. I also wear glasses which makes the area behind my ears hurt if the headphones are too tight. <br />  These were surprisingly comfortable. The earcups are nice and big so your ear doesnt get crunched and the inside is slanted so the back of your ear fits right in. These are a sort of "wide" headphone set so they fit without the too-tightnes. As other reviewers said, they are pretty big and bulky, so theyre best just for home use. <br />  The sound quality trumps every other headphone i've used (including earphones which sound louder). I listen to music very loud a lot of the time, and am often frustrated that i can't make it louder, but I found myself turning the volume down with this set due to having too full a sound. <br /><br />I also didnt find any majorly noticeable difference between music and movie mode with the small exception that movie has a bit more bass. <br /><br />I was a little sad to see that amazon charges about 10 bucks cheaper than what I paid for the phones at target, but with this set, I can deal with it.

good headphones!
i bought headphones several months ago and i have really put them to the test. there really is no difference in sound between music and movie mode but i did notice that if you listen to your music on movie mode, the bass is more solid than if you use it on music mode. if you listen to music in a moderate volume, you can actually feel the bass and it feels great. i love headphones that can make you feel the bass. for the price i paid for, i have had more expensive headhones that can not do that. so these sony headphones can really rock with awesome bass. i know they are not the best sounding headphones and you might think that you get what you paid for, but the last time i had headphones like these, they cost me more than twice than these but they did not have the huge 40mm magnets and they were pioneer. what ever happened to them? for good sounding headphones, if you don't want to spend a million dollars, go with these. you will not be dissapointed.

Very nice headphones!
I am not a connoisseur of headphone sets. But I was concerned with finding something that looked like it would not be to small, was easily adjustable and not to fragile! So after some considerable searching here at Amazon and reading the reviews I chose these!  <br />Out of the box I knew I picked the right set for myself. They fit very well, with plenty of room for ears and are very light in weight, which seems deceptive at first glace. The balance of stereo seems just fine to my untrained ears and I'm very pleased with this purchase. <br /><br />Lastly the movie/music button seems to have no effect while listening to a CD or regular TV. I haven't tried a DVD yet, but the button is really of no concern to me whatsoever, as all I wanted in this headset I have. <br />

Just Perfect
I am a college student in an Audio/Video degree, they are wonderful, I being them back and foth with me everyday and they can handle alot of beating up.  Love them! If The sound is awesome on them.  Also used them for airplan rides and they block out most of the noise.  <br /><br />A must have for music junkies and students!

Extended wearing doesn't hurt the ears
They sound good without going through all of the specs, but the best part is that you can wear them for hours without hurting your ears.  I have had many headsets. Anywhere from 15 minutes to less than an hour, my ears hurt, and it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to wear them.  I can wear these indefinitely without any discomfort.  No they don't sound like a $200 variety, but I have paid over $100 and not had any better sound.  I am ordering my 2nd set as a gift.

Great sounding, comfortable headphones at a low price!
I've bought a lot of headphones in my life and these are absolutely the best. Not only are they extremely comfortable (they don't push on your ear like other ones; instead, they go around the ear), but they also sound very good. They have enough bass for anybody. Obviously these probably aren't quite as good as the ones that are hundreds of dollars, but then again they're only $25! These headphone also have a cord that is VERY long. If you're like me and you want to watch television with the headphones on from across the room, these are convenient. I promise you won't regret buying these!

A high end product in an affordable package.
I have been looking into many different brands and styles of cans, even the high end Sennheisers and AKGs.  Well with that said, even with experience with other more expensive headphones, I can honestly say that I am completely satisfied with these cans.  You get the sound clarity and bass, that may not be equal, but can compare to the higher end sound.  Aside from being a great sounding headphone, they also are very comfortable.  The light design and ergonomic ear area only contributes to the overall experience.  I have been wearing these for extended periods of time without any problems, and sometimes they're so comfortable that I forget that they're on!  To sum up, if you want a quality affodable package, go for these cans.  But if you have the money, go for the higher end headphones.

For the price their 5 stars..
These have lasted for 100s hours so far and sound good.  There pretty comfortable but they could be more comfortable across the top but around the ears their almost perfect..  The cord is extra long so if you use them around the house their great.  They also look good for big phones..

Comfortable, Affordable, Awesome
I've had these headphones for at least five years, and they've never given me any trouble - they're still in great shape and I use them daily. Tough design, comfy earpads, pretty solid sound (doesn't get too ear-blasting loud). The only drawback I can think of is its super-long, 11.5" cord, which isn't the easiest to deal with when you're lugging it around with your MP3 player.<br /><br />Still, all in all, one of the best set of 'phones I've ever had. I love 'em!

Made for a great xmas gift...
Got these for my brother for Christmas since he constantly has headphones on for watching movies and making his own videos...got these for him (a serious upgrade from what he was using), was very pleased when they came in the mail...I almost want to order a second pair for myself. The price is more than fair, these headphones look good and are comfortable.

Technical Explanation and Spec Review
It seems from a lot of the reviews on here, that people don't quite understand the specs behind headphones which are crucial to its sound. A lot of people are comparing these headphones to iPod earbuds and saying that it sounds like something is missing. Here's why:<br /><br />The technical specs for iPod earbuds:<br />Bandwidth response-20Hz to 20,000Hz<br />Impedance-32ohms<br /><br />The technical specs for MDR-V150s:<br />Bandwidth response-18Hz to 22000Hz<br />Impedance-24ohms<br /><br />For those of you who don't understand the numbers, it means that the MDR-V150s have a broader range of sound, but the iPod earbuds pack a bigger sound. This is precisely why you think something is missing. <br /><br />If you listen to iPod earbuds over a long time, your ears become accustomed to really loud, albeit a small range, sound. This is also why iPod earbuds are known for causing serious harm to your ears over prolonged periods of use. For it to sound right, you have to use the full amount of power, which the earbuds provide. Your close-range hearing becomes damaged over time and you can't hear subtle sounds or details, but you can still detect low volume. The earbuds won't sound deafening because you can still hear outside noise.<br /><br />The MDR-V150s have a larger range of sound and lower impedance. That means there is a much richer sound. You don't need to jack up the volume to get a good listen (but you do need your hearing intact). You also may not be used to the larger range of sound so the range of sound you're used to will sound drowned out at close range. Many of the comments complaining about this transition from earbuds are noting that staples of their music listening sound strangely undetailed on the MDR-V150s. High levels of bass have a way of "drowning" out treble sounds if you're not used to listening to music with ample bass at close range. <br /><br />Another major difference is that since these are "on-ear" headphones instead of "in-ear" buds, you have much less outside noise interfering with listening. It's like the difference between listening to a car stereo with the windows up or the windows down. You have to listen to things louder if there's more outside noise and you can't notice as many details either. There is a reason cellphone handsets for the car use earbuds instead of headphones, and that's so you can still hear the road. Why would you want to use earbuds that are intentionally designed so you can still hear your surroundings but compensate for it by deafening you?<br /><br />I work a lot with sound whether it's production, music, or art and I use these as portable stereo phones because of their quality and sound range. I use them with my iPod with the long cord tucked into my case's belt clip. They are incredibly affordable for their quality. Most comparable headphones cost at least $30. I have been using these headphones since freshman year of college when I was first exposed to them in my school's sound lab. <br /><br />My opinion aside, the manufacturer specs speak for themselves and it's hard to imagine that iPod earbud fans really believe that these provide less sound when physically they have a much broader range of sound and do not permanently damage your ears.<br /><br />As for the tightness, it's good. It'll keep the phones pressed against your ears. The padding coupled with the tightness is what keeps as much outside noise sealed out. The more noise cancellation you can get, the better the sound.<br /><br />And for the hair complaint: you could always tie up your hair or give up on headphones with plastic size adjusters. The plastic size adjusters were just designed to snag hair, so it seems.

The best headphones I've ever owned
I'm not a connoisseur of headphones, and quite honestly I don't think I've even paid much more than $20 for a pair of headphones.  And maybe because of this, I've never owned a set of headphones that I was totally happy with until now.  These are by far the best headphones I've even bought, and I was just floored by how good some of my favorites sound on these headphones.  I just hear so much more.  <br /><br />I hesitated to buy these since so many people on Amazon complained about the feel of these headphones saying they pinched.  Well, they are bigger than what I'm used to - a little bulky maybe - but I found them really pretty comfortable.  Also, because they fit a little tighter, they seem to block out a lot more noise, which make them great for the gym or walking down a busy street.

Cheap, durable, and high quality.
But then, what else do you expect from Sony? I don't claim to be an audiophile, but I have nothing but love for these headphones after using them for perhaps a year now. I used to go through headphones every couple of months; something or other would break and I would have to go back and look for another pair. The MDR-V150 stopped that revolving door. The sound is excellent, and the headphones feel light on the head even after hours of use. The best feature here is the way the earphones plug into the headband; if you ever jerk on the cord too hard (like I always accidentally do when I put a foot on it while I stand up) the earphone pieces detach from the headband, rather than snapping the plastic bits like many other headphones in this price range will. You snap the earphones back into the headband and you're back in business. <p>I use these headphones every day, and while I'm sure most true audiogeeks would be better suited by a pair of Seinnheisers or another high-end brand, this pair is perfect for me. Heck, I'm on my fourth different CD player since buying them; how's that for longevity? Highly recommended if you're in the market for headphones near the 20 dollar price point.

Great sound, really comfortable, long cord
I have my headphones on almost all day when I work, so I really needed a very comfortable pair.  These totally fit the bill.  The ear cups are nice and squishy and feel very light on my head.  Contrary to some other reviews, I didn't find them tight at all, and I have a pretty big noggin.  The sound is great - clear, sharp, good range.  The cord is really long, which is also good for me since my desk area is over 6' long.  For the price, you can't beat these headphones.

FINALLY I found the headphones I've been searching for!
I work in an office job where I'm allowed to wear headphones while I work. For the past two years, I've been searching for the right pair - I had no idea it would be this difficult! <br /><br />Every pair that I've purchased have had some problem or another. The ear bud ones are always too big and hurt my ears (and besides, they get pretty gross). The standard walkman-type headphones are comfortable but the music is pretty audible to people nearby when you play it even at a normal level.<br /><br />Basically, I was searching for a pair of headphones for $35 or less that would hold sound in reasonably well (everyone always advertises noise-cancelling - I wanted noise-containing!), but didn't look like they should be worn by an air traffic controller!<br /><br />I've been exceedingly pleased with these headphones for the week that I've had them. Yes, they are a bit bulkier than some of the more trendy headphones that are out there but they are much better quality. I can't blast my music but I can listen to it somewhat loudly without being audible to anyone around me. The ears are really soft and comfortable, although I will say that I've encountered the same issue with the headset getting a bit uncomfortably tight after wearing it for several hours - especially when I'm wearing my glasses. I expect that will get better as I wear them in. I haven't had any problems with my hair getting stuck in them, as another reviewer mentioned (my hair is several inches past my shoulders).<br /><br />If you're looking for the same things that I was, I would strongly recommend these headphones! I would have paid double and still been very happy with them.

Awesome headphones
I can't stand the earbuds that came with my iPod, I picked these headphones up after a friend in radio recommended them to me. So far they have provided me with over 4 years of solid service. I use them with my notebook or iPod nearly daily. I have noticed subtleties in some of my favorite songs I never had before (one time I took them off thinking someone was at my door but it was a drumbeat in the song). The super long cord is very convenient, I like to listen to music while ice skating and the long cord allows for a lot of freedom of movement. Comfortable, durable and very functional, these are really a great deal.

Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones
I wanted headphones with a substantial connecting cord of a decent length. These headphones fill that bill easily. The cord is over 6 feet in length has a connector that will mesh with a devices from audio equipment to IPods with the micro-plug. I liked the versatility.<br />  For audiophiles, the sound is rich in bass and has crisp tones. The ear cups cover the ear blocking any outside sounds from intruding into your music or audiobook.<br />  The price is right for a real bargain in headphones.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great bargain, great product
These headphones are a tremendous steal for under $15.  I've been a loyal Sony Headphone user since I bought my first Walkman, oh so many moons ago.  <br /><br />These headphones won't give you a neckache (like heavier models), the sound quality is great, and the design allows for hours of comfortable wear.  <br /><br />One downside - the length of the cord seems a little long - for the average user (using these for a portable device or laptop) will find that there are a few feet of cord to spare.  Since the cord is rubberized, thus less likely to fold away easily, it does tend to get in the way.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Quality headphones at a great price!
I've had three pairs and I've been satisfied with all of them. If my cat didn't find the cord so tasty, I'd still be using the first pair. I like the extra long cord and the fact that it's thicker than most. I find the earcups very comfortable and have travelled with these a few times - the size is good and their rugged enough to withstand some tossing around in your briefcase. Gaming, movies, music - they work well for all the above. I think it's the quality build and sound for the $$ that I'm most impressed with. These really should be $25-$30 at least. I would/will buy these again. For $15 (or even $25) you can't beat these.

Excellent sound quality
I was very pleased with the sound quality of the headphones considering the price I paid for them.

value to cost ratio is outstanding
These are probably the best headphones I've ever had, and I'll tell you why:<br /><br />1. Durable - I've broken dozens of headphones over these years but these have yet to succumb to the ravages of time, and they've been through some rough spots with me:  dropped on the ground, pounded as I throw my bookbag around, and used quite a bit.<br /><br />2. Really Long Cord (tm).<br /><br />3. Sound Quality - I'm no snotty audiophile, but these 'phones give a nice warm sound and provide decent thump.<br /><br />4. Comfortable - snug is GOOD when it comes to headphones and these stay on pretty well.  The earpieces are padded and don't hurt the ears. <br /><br />5. Price - they're only 20 dollars, so it's not like it's a big risk here, people!<br /><br /><br />

Best in class
I'm gonna make this brief: I would gladly pay up to 4 times what I paid for these headphones. Great quality, incredible durability, and I did a doubletake when I read the price on the till at my local shop. Highly recommended; these have replaced my $150 studio headphones which have sadly not aged well.

Nothing short of WOW!
First things first. These are not for kids who wanna listen to all their hardcore screamo death metal at earsplitting volumes. These are not for people who have a 1000 watt sub in their car. These are not for people who take music casually.<br /><br />These are for recording.<br /><br />I don't claim to be an expert on what good headphones sound like. I've never had the money to try some 500 dollar audiophile phones. I am a very active musician; I run a studio in my bedroom and my bands practice room. I've been recording in my bedroom for about four years. I use Adobe Audition 2 as my main recording software. <br /><br />The Audio-Technica ATH M40fs headphones are THE BEST headphones I have ever heard. I'm sure they're not the best in the world. They're just the best I've used, and I'm pretty sure they're the best for the price.<br /><br />With these headphones I can hear subtleties and nuances that I never believed possible. I can hear breath noise on the flute intro to Yanni's Deliverance. I can hear the bass on Dreamgirl by Dave Matthews without it beng muddy. I can hear the rumbling lows on the intro to The Battle from the Chronicles of Narnia Soundtrack. These headphones are not bassy, nor are they harsh on the mids, they're not overly trebly either. They are very flat as far as I can tell. I love that I can hear all the different parts to music without any of them being over-emphasized. <br /><br />The downfall to these phones is that they let you hear ALL of the flaws in your own music; it's kind of depressing. If you want to sound like an amazing pro musician just by buying a new pair of headphones...look elsewhere, if you want to hear your mistakes so you can improve, and don't wanna spend a month's paycheck...then these are for you.<br /><br />The thing that mainly attracted me to these headphones was the frequency range which was wider than the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's that I originally wanted. On top of that, the price was 40 dollars lower; hard to pass up.<br /><br />Another feature that makes these worth your while is the Field Replaceable parts. I don't know about you, but I don't have the money to buy a new set of headphones if my cable wears out.<br /><br />These have pretty good isolation. They won't block as much sound as earplugs but they block enough to keep your sound pretty pure.<br /><br />If you want to hear your music in a way that you never have then buy these headphones.

Amazing!
Finally headphones that pump out the sound I want, with the comfort I want, at a price I can afford!<br />You just can't go wrong with a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M40fs's on your ears!<br /><br />If you like balanced high quality sound that exploits every pitch and accentuates every tone, you can get it right here. If you want headphones that don't hurt your head, don't clamp your ears, and provide good isolation, hey! The ATH-M40fs is your baby!<br />The build quality is fantastic, complete over the ear circumaural design, very professional in style and durability.<br />I searched all over to find an amazing pair of headphones that wouldn't rip a hole in my pocket, and I found them.<br /><br />I am extremely happy I chose these. I was on the skeptical side. I almost bought higher priced Sennheisers, but opted not to due to comfort issues and cheap headband construction.<br />I was worried about sound quality; as I like to hear every vocal and instrument the way it was intended. For anyone who is looking to listen to music at a higher level with a price suitable for the everyday person. These headphones do justice to the Audio-Technica brand!<br />I use them for listening to all my music and games; high fidelity classical recordings, popular music (Jewel's intricate voice sounds so good with these strapped to your head), occasional video games (I play adventure, mystery, and RPG's).<br /><br />The bass is accurate, not overdone and not enhanced. Balanced sound throughout. Great for really getting into the music.<br />Are these the headphones you've always been looking for but thought they didn't exist? Yes, yes they are!<br />Are they the best headphone ever made? Well, I wouldn't say that. I've never listed to $150.00+ headphones before. So I am sure there are headphones out there that will make these sound lamer than scary movie 3. But I couldn't imagine needing to. Some headphones can cost over $900! I'm not a recording artist, I don't use these to monitor music. And I don't work as a audio engineer. But I am very picky about, well, almost everything! I am an artist of the visual kind. And these headphone produce high enough audio fidelity for most anyone who can appreciate well recorded audio. I do require a high level of quality, I am very sensitive to subtle details in sound. If there is distortion or a small hiss is my audio equipment, I can hear it.<br />When comparing headphones and speakers, I can clearly hear pitch subtlties, faded or more pronounced background instruments, and other differences.<br />Besides, even a farmer in good ol' Georgia can appreciate, and have an ear for good audio fidelity.<br /><br />For me, these headphones are great. They produce sound in a highly respectable manner at the price I am willing to spend. And thats what counts to most people.<br /><br />Audio-Technica also makes a variant model of these, ATH-D40fs with enhanced bass. I feel some may prefer them to these and find them more suitable for video games, watching certain movies, and those who like that extra thump.<br /><br />They also make much higher priced headphones for anyone requiring more fidelity. After listening to these I think they are a very viable brand, completely on level with competing against the well known brands of Sennheiser, Koss, bose, Beryldynamic, and Grado.<br /><br /><br />Audio products I own:<br />Onkyo TX-SR500 reciever<br />iAudio G3 digital audio player<br />Audio-Technica ATH-M40fs headphones (of course)<br />Koss UR29 headphones<br />Koss the plug earbuds<br />Koss Porta Pro headphones<br />Panasonic RP-HJE50 earbuds<br />Audio-Technica PRO 24 XY Stereo Condenser Microphone<br />Audio-Technica Pro5V headphones (returned due to comfort, the lack thereof)

Wonderful Headphones!
This review is for:<br />Audio Technica ATHM40FS Precision StudioPhones<br /><br />First of all right out of the package they look expensive. They do not look cheaply made and the matte black coloring and shape of these headphones is pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />From the top down:<br /><br />The headband is approximately two inches wide and covered even on the top with some type of soft to the touch material. The underside of the headband is very well padded and the padding extends almost down to the hinge where the earpieces are connected to the headpiece. The padding is nice and squishy, but not so much that you can feel the hardness underneath. The thickness of the padding is approximately 3/4 of an inch thick.<br /><br />These earphones are very light, I've been wearing them all day with no neck fatigue, or headache from too much pressure around the ears.<br /><br />The tension of the headband is enough to hold the earphones on my head, but they rest comfortably without pressure around my ears. <br /><br />The hinges where the earpieces meet the body are made from some type of heavy duty, hard plastic(I don't know the technical name for it). The hinges are nice and thick. They look well made and able to take a lot of use.<br /><br />The earpieces:<br /><br />The shape is sort of an elongated oval. They are lined all the way around by padding that is approximately 3/4 of an inch thick, and one inch wide, and they're covered by the same velvety soft material as the headband padding. This padding feels wonderful against the skin. The padding that touches the skin is flattened to fit against the head better, giving these headphones excellent sound squelching qualities. <br /><br />The inside of each earpiece is oval in shape and the inside depth is between 1/2 and inch and 3/4 of an inch. The inside wells that hold the speakers are covered with some type of soft fabric as well.<br />The holes under the fabric where the speakers are located are shifted slightly toward the back side of the ear pieces. <br /><br />The outside housing is a some type of matte black high density plastic, and the R and L on each one is molded into the plastic rather than being painted on so that it won't rub off eventually. <br /><br />The hinges:<br />Move smoothly and easily. There are two sets of them. One allows the earpieces to be rotated out when they're being worn, so outside noises or conversation can be heard without taking them completely off. They're made of matte black high density plastic also. They're nice and thick, and the part that attaches the earpieces to the headband meets the headband smoothly. If you didn't know the seam was there, you'd probably miss it. Each earpiece can be rotated out to the front approximately 180 degrees, and to the back considerably less.<br /><br />The other set of hinges are the same color and material, and they fit sleekly against the earpieces in their own grooves, giving the earpieces a smooth appearance when on the head. There is nothing sticking out, and it's very aesthetic. When they're on the head the hinges and earpieces look like they're all one piece. I don't know who designed them, but whoever it is they're smart, LOL.<br /><br /><br />The Cord:<br /><br />Runs from the left earpiece, and is not reinforced at the point it meets the earpiece. The cord is very long and has a nice thickness to it. It's not flimsy at all. If you don't need the length, I suggest tying it up with a zip it, or something similar, to keep it out of the way. I like the length personally. If you're like me and you forget you're wearing these headphones and get out of your chair to get something it doesn't pull everything off the shelf:D<br /><br />The cord terminates in a 1/4 stereo plug, and is reinforced at the back end of the plug with a flexible metal spring that's approximately an inch long. The plug itself is textured for easy gripping.<br /><br />If you're going to use these headphones for your: computer, tv, portable CD player or whatever. You're going to need to buy a 3.5 mm adapter because these headphones don't come with one in the box, like some of the other Audio Tecnica headphones.<br /><br />But it's easy to find an adpater, and not much hassle. You can buy adapter kits. There is an adapter kit with four different sizes of adapters, right here on Amazon for 5.00 or so. Sound and audio stores should have them as well as electronics stores, I think even Wally World has them. Radio Shack has a kit that's a little different from the one here on Amazon, but it still has four different sized adapters. Just make sure you get a stereo to stereo adapter, not stereo to mono adapter. <br /><br /><br />Isolation:<br /><br />These really do a good job. When I'm listening to music I don't hear anything else unless the sound is extremely loud. <br /><br />The sound:<br /><br />The sound of music through these is excellent. I can hear everything the way it was meant to be heard. Nothing added or taken away. But listening pleasure is subjective. I really enjoy the music I hear through these headphones just playing MP3s on my computer without a fancy sound card on my computer. DVD movies sound very good also. The soundtracks sound great.<br /><br />The longer I listen the better music sounds through these headphones.<br /><br />The highs aren't sharp and grating, and the mid range is there, the lows are smooth and present. Nothing is muddy sounding to me. All the sounds are separated and discernible but not so sharply delineated that it picks the music to pieces with one drowning out the other. Everything is nicely balanced and flows together like music should. It sounds like I'm hearing a live performance. The bass is there, but it is NOT very pronounced and isn't the focus.<br /><br />I don't hear any distortion at a higher volume, but then again I can't stand very loud music, it hurts my ears. You don't have to turn these all the way up to hear decently. I'm listening to Illumination by Hemi- Sync right now and I've got my system volume turned up to 3/4 and Winamp volume is at 9%, and that's quite enough to enjoy the music. I can still hear everything very well with no interference from outside noise.<br /><br />The music accompanies the singer rather than drowning them out. If you enjoy the lyrics, like me, as much as the music, then these headphones are fantastic. The lyrics are very easy to understand,and the voice of the singer is perfectly presented.<br /><br />Meatloaf "Life is a Lemon" sounds heavenly through these, and so does Garth Brooks "Friends in Low Places". Pink Floyd sounds divine, and so does John Denver. Mozart sounds great too. PussyCat Dolls "Don'tcha" sounds just as good to me. Rammstein - Blade Theme (Techno Remix) sounds as good as all the rest. Roberta Flack is as close to blues as I've gotten yet, and she sounds amazing. Minnie Ripperton's "Loving You" Sounds good too. I haven't listened to anything jazzier. Pantera sounds good, and so do the Heavy Metal soundtracks( 1 and 2). I hope that gives you some idea about the range of music that sounds great with these headphones. Meditation music sounds great also.<br /><br /><br />Summation:<br /><br />These are excellent quality headphones for the price. Someone put a lot of thought and effort into  designing these. I always look at the details, and if someone paid attention to those I know they care about their product. <br /><br />These headphones are light and comfortable on the head, and about the ears. They can be worn comfortably for extended periods of time without causing a headache. I believe they provide enough isolation, and outside sound dampening, to satisfy most music afficianados. <br /><br />If you're looking for very pronounced bass, don't buy these unless you want to adjust the the bass to your satisfaction on your music source. <br /><br />All in all I'm very pleased with these headphones, and I would buy them again. The price and the quality make this set of headphones an excellent buy.<br /><br />On a sidenote: The customer service people are very nice. I emailed the customer service department for the amplitude range on another set I was eyeballing which are also made by audio Technica. The frequency response of headphones means nothing if the amplitude is way out of whack. It took about a week for them to answer but he very nice fellow who answered sent me JPGs of the amplitude graphs for the set I asked about, and another set. I'm sure he probably had to hunt the graphs down and then make a file to attach it to the email he sent me. Now that is customer service! Kudos to Audio Technica for their customer service. And that was before the sale!<br /><br />The two sets were: Audio Technica ATH-A700 Closed-Back Dynamic Headphones With Double Air Damping and Audio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Headphones.<br /><br />If you're interested the amplitude range on the ATH-AD700 was much more flat than the ATH-A700, with less variation overall.<br /><br />Alrighty then, that's all I can think of at the moment.<br /><br />I'm enjoying my music on these very same headphones while I'm typing away.<br /><br /> <br /><br />

If "High Fidelity" is what you are looking for then this headphones is the right choice.
Once the "Hifi Choice" says about this Audio-Technica ATH-M40FS " These 'phones have an uncontrollable desire to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They quite simply take a piece of music and tell it how it is." <br /><br />If you want the real "High Fidelity" headphones you should buy this one.<br /><br />No doubt why this headphones become an industrial standard around the world.<br />A real competitor of the formidable "Sony MDR 7506 Studio Monitor".<br /><br />Since I have quoted from a review by "Hifi Choice" then I would like to quote more for the conclusion.<br /><br />" A pair of good honest headphones, which refuse to add anything to the original recording, yet take nothing away. If you like your music to have that raw, 'straight out of the studio' edge then these headphones are a must. A rockin' Recommended. "

Superb Headphones
The sound quality of the ATH-M40FS headphones is superb.  I can hear high frequencies that I didn't hear with similar or lower priced headphones.  The bass is "true" and clear with no distortion and is not accentuated like so many headphones and speakers are these days.  I hate listening to headphones with accentuated bass that overwhelms the true sound.<br /><br />I compared this headphone with my Sony MDR-7506 headphones which is a professional industry standard.  I've been using the 7506 headphones professionally for about 9 years. <br /><br />Both have superb sound quality and sound almost the same.  In fact, my first impression is that the M40 may have slightly better high frequency response and sounds a hair crisper.  The M40 seems to be a tiny tad louder than the 7506 when I swap plugs without touching the volume so don't worry about its sensitivity.  The M40 is slightly heavier at 10 ounces verses the 7506 at 8 ounces (headphones only, not including the cables).<br /><br />The 7506 is more comfortable than the M40 since it has better quality padding and soft material where it touches the head.  The M40 seems to clamp my head a bit more but I think that I will be able to lessen the pressure by bending the metal in the headband.  Didn't want to overdo that all at once now.  This is not to say that the M40 is uncomfortable.  Each earpiece on the M40 is hinged and rotates.  Looking at the photo you can see how it hinges on the forks but it's not obvious that each earpiece can rotate 180 degrees also.  Therefore each earpiece can sit squarely on your head, unlike cheaper headphones that hinge but do not rotate.<br /><br />The cord is about 5/32 inch in diameter and 11.5 feet long.  This is better quality cable than the small cables usually found on cheaper headphones.  It has a  inch male phone plug on the end which is what professional equipment uses.  If you want to plug it into a 1/8" mini phone jack like what typical walkman type headphones plug into, then buy a cheap " to 1/8" male adapter from Radio Shack before your headset arrives.<br /><br />I would rate the sound quality 5 stars and the comfort 4 stars.  I will be using my M40 headphones to listen to TV and the sound quality is so good that I know I will use them more than the TV speakers. While the Sony MDR-7506 headphones are more comfortable, this is the best bang for the buck headphones that I've found.  It is so good that I'm planning to buy another set before Amazon stops selling them.  <br /><br />

Good Cans
Good headphones. Great range of sounds. They are crisp and distinctive. They make movies, games and music sound great. They aren't "noise canceling" but when the music is playing most sounds get nixed.  My homeboy bought a $200 pair of Bose headphones and after comparing both he thinks i got the better deal. Can't really beat the price. Oh and the jack on the end of these is the bigger jack for professional stereo equipment. You will have to buy an adapter. Phillips sells a adapter pack for like 10 bucks. Hope this helps.

Excellent choice for recording and general use
Having used many brands and types of headphones over the years in recording studio settings for many years, I was disatisified many times by the performance of many 'cans.' These AT's fit the bill perfectly for my studio as well as home needs: excellent low-end response [what's usually lacking], good design, good price. Highly recommended.

Great sound, clear tight bass, sturdy. Highly recommended.
Very, very clear sound, plenty of bass but not boomy/murky, nice long cord... no complaints whatsoever. Oh yeah and $70, holy cow! Maybe I should buy a spare pair in case this one breaks... :)<br /><br />But they're not as flimsy as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007ZFM38">Logitech Stereo USB Headset 250</a>s that I bought these heaphones to replace. It was made of thin plastic and though it sounded good (including the mic) it broke and even duct tape couldn't hold it together again. These things look a lot tougher.<br /><br />BTW, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FUESSU">V-MODA Bass Freq</a> headphones; that's what I use in the teeny in-ear walkin-down-the-street portable category (i.e. iPod) when big cans look silly. They sound great and are super compact.<br />

Outstanding Headphones -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
I purchased these headphones along with JVC's SU-DH1 Surround Headphone Adaptor, so that I could enjoy movies in full 5.1-channel surround sound without disturbing my neighbors. The Audio-Technica headphones are a great complement to the JVC adaptor, and provide incredible sound quality.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, it is difficult to find a comparable set of headphones for the same price (or less). Indeed, it seems that these headphones provide sound quality rivaling headphones costing significantly more.<br /><br />The bottom line? If you are looking for outstanding headphones, the Audio Technica ATH-M40fs are the ones to get. You will not be disappointed!

Sounds great, very comfortable, best value
I got the ATH-M40fs headphones to use at work because I didn't want to keep taking my old ATH-M30 headphones back and forth.  <br /><br />My old ATH-M30's are really good headphones, and I still use them at home.  When I first got them, my urge was to up the bass on the EQ.  After years of almost daily use, I tended to increase the treble a bit.  So I thought maybe I was getting old and suffering some hearing loss at the high end.<br /><br />Not so.  I think the old headphones were just wearing out, not my hearing.<br /><br />These new M40fs headphones, I have the same tendency to up the bass sometimes.  But they are super crisp and clear in the mid and high frequencies, and the bass is solid and not at all muddy.  They sound awesome at mid-high volume, and a little EQ helps at low volume, to my ears. <br /><br />Comparing the M30 and M40, I would say they are both very comfortable.  The M40 are looser and bigger, so if you have trouble with tight headphones and small earpads, maybe the M40's would suit you better.  Otherwise, both sound really good.  And they are amazing for the price.<br /><br />Audio Techinca is a class act.  The build quality is very good.  For example the cords are 3+ meters of litz wire, which is not cheap or easy to use in manufacturing.  Also the old ATH-M30 earpads started to wear out because of my eyeglasses, but I couldn't find how to buy new ones on line (unlike Sennheiser or Koss).  So I emailed customer support, and they sent me a new set, for free, in a week.<br /><br />For closed back headphones that give great sound and comfort with good passive external noise isolation, I doubt anything would beat the Audio Technica's, especially for the price.

The best I've owned
I've been through a number of headphones over the years and recently broke a pair of Bose headphones that I was never that happy with to begin with. Ever since, I've been searching for just the right kind of headphones - flat response, comfortable over long periods of wear, good construction, good isolation, under $100. Check, check, check, check, and check! I'm ecstatic with these headphones. Easily the best I've owned.

Professional Headphones for the Consumer
These headphones are quite a bargain. Here's where I'm coming from: About seven years ago I bought my first pair of good headphones - the Grado SR80 for around $100. They served me well, and I still use them. However, they do have their drawbacks - they're not the most comfortable 'phones in the world, plus their open design is inappropriate in some situations when you don't want to share your music with those around you. So, I began my search for a pair of comfortable, closed headphones. I'm the type that always does my research before a purchase like this, and spent hours perusing the head-fi forum, reading reviews, and comparing prices. Well, I am completely satisfied with my choice, and find myself using these even more than my Grados - besides being more comfortable, I actually prefer the sound.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sturdy build quality<br />Very comfortable<br />Great, neutral sound<br />Long cord<br />Cord attaches to only one side<br />Rotating earpieces allow 'phones to be stored flat<br /><br />Cons:<br />Large size - not the best for traveling (though no larger than they need to be for this design)<br />1/4" plug - need an adapter for 3.5mm plugs, leading to strain on plug<br />Not the most stylish - utilitarian design; any color, as long as it's black<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is a no-frills pair of headphones with every cent of the price going into sound, comfort, and durability. Made for professional musicians, they will likely satisfy the consumer looking for this style of headphone.

spoils me rotten!
I've been using these headphones for a week or so, and loving em.  Definitely a huge step up from anything I've used before.  Granted, most of the headphones I've used previously have been in the $20-$40 range, so these are just a bit more expensive, but given the really huge boost in both comfort and fidelity, I think these are a no-brainer.<br /><br />Like the other fellow said though, these are hi-fi speakers and don't come with a mini plug connection (like your ipod or pc will have).  So if you want to use them for that purpose you'll need an adaptor or a sound interface card/box.

Third time's the charm
Ever since I received an MP3 player as a gift, I wanted a pair of headphones that were over-the-ear. On-the-ear makes them itch after awhile and earbuds are just uncomfortable for me. <br /><br />First, I tried a pair of Skullcandy HESH. They were comfortable, but the sound was terrible. After that, I tried the Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones. The sound was great, but they were INCREDIBLY uncomfortable.<br /><br />Finally, I ordered a pair of these. I figured for the sale price, why not? And boy am I glad I got them. The sound quality is fantastic and they are VERY comfortable. Nothing is over accentuated with the sound. I listen to everything from classical/instrumental to country to punk to pop/rock and it all sounds great. <br /><br />However, I'd like to point out something very important for potential buyers. These are, as the title specifies 'studiophones'. They were made with professionals in mind, working at equipment. Not CD or MP3 players. The plug is 6.3mm, while most personal players take 3.5mm plugs. I bought an adapter, but with the length of the plug and the adapter, it's almost as long as my MP3 player itself. I have included photos above so you can see. I do not consider this a negative, as this was what I was choosing these headphones to be used for. <br /><br />Also, with the adapter, I'm not able to use a hard-plastic case I was keeping my View in. The plastic prevented the plug from going all the way in, resulting in sound in only one speaker. I had to switch to a silicone skin. I'm looking into a leather case, however, hopefully that will be fine.<br /><br />All-in-all, highly recommended.

Very satisfied and will probably purchase more.
I am very satisfied with the quality of these headphones.  I use them almost everyday for long periods of time.  They are very comfortable.  They do not enhance the sound quality in anyway (which is very important when recording songs), so I hear the songs for exactly what they are in my recording.  I would definitely make this purchase again!

Bliss.
These headphones are wonderful. I tried these out due to the fact that my old skullcandy headphones died and I the price was so good. These headphones  are light years ahead of what I was using. They are light, comfortable, and frictionless in adjustment. <br /><br />The sound produced is best described as segregated. You can hear each individual instrument unlike some headphones which simply spit the sound in clumps. It is amazing what a difference an EQ adjustment makes with these headphones as well. <br /><br />Up until now I really didn't mess with it because nothing I owned seemed to respond to the adjustment, these do. If you are listening to CD's, MP3's, play an instrument, mix or have play video games at night while everyone is sleeping you will be grateful for this purchase. <br /><br />I spend a lot of time in public areas where I like to shut out unwanted noise and these headphones allow for that better than my v-moda earbuds. The only concern I have is how durable these headphone are. They are so light that I wonder about how they might hold up outside my home, on a plane flight for instance. They do respond to all external force by sliding and adjusting as needed but I would hate to split something so wonderfully constructed. Still, I am extremely happy I purchased these at such a theft-level price.

Great cans
For the money you can't go wrong with these.  I'm in the process of transferring several hundred old 45s to MP3 and these phones are on my head for hours sometimes.  They're comfortable, with minimal fatigue yet the exclude enough background noise that I can concentrate on equalization and other enhancements to make sure I get the best sounding MP3.  I'm not sure I'd rate these as high as the Grado SR-80 (or higher) but they're very neutral and uncolored nonetheless, and for recording and transfer, they fill the bill. If you do audio work of any sort, these deserve serious consideration. You could spend more and get less. Having worked with them for a while now, I believe they are a true bargain.

Like 'em alot!
The quality of these headphones blew me away.  They are comfortable, don't squeeze at all, the single cord is nice, lots of padding on the ear cups and head band does its job.  The sound quality is superb, no buzz or hum in the background at all, music is reproduced as wonderfully as advertised.  The headphones block out most background noise without putting pressure on you ears or head.  These headphones are set up with an 1/8" stereo jack, so get a good quality adapter if you have a music player that is newer than 1981.  I've been using these headphones alot for the past month since I got them...they seem to be holding up perfectly, nothing is showing wear, sound quality is still great.  Buy and be happy!

Excellent Monitor Phones for Recording/Mixing
I bought these to use with my new Alesis Guitarist Playmate and they are great.  They are light and fit the head perfectly.  They are very comfortable and can be worn for hours while recording or mixing.  The sound is very neutral - you hear what you recorded.  They have a very broad freq response.  At the price, it would be hard to find a better headphone for recording or studio work where pure reproduction is required.

True-sound headphone for recording purposes
I have had this headphone for more than 5 years, and have not had any problem with it.   I use it primarily while sitting at my Yamaha keyboard, as well as for auditing my recordings.  The sounds are natural and accurate.  The swivel ear cups make it easy to put on and take off.  If you don't mind headphone with big ear cups, and don't want to spend a fortune, this is it.

My favorite headphones, period.
I am EXTREMELY picky about sound. I have spent a couple of years and many hundreds of dollars searching for the perfect headphones, and with the M40s I have found them.<br />They are the only headphones I have encountered with a perfect frequency response. Their FR graph is literally a horizontal line from 5Hz to 28KHz! A truly incredible achievement. As a result, the sound is flawless, with every part of the audible spectrum represented and nothing masked by anything else.<br />There is no distortion whatsoever, none.<br />There is a truly microscopic level of detail.<br />The soundstage is unusually large for closed headphones, and imaging is pinpoint precise as well as 3-dimensional.<br />Instrument tones and voices are perfectly natural and lifelike, just like being there in the studio or at the concert. I can here every word of the lyrics (even by mumblers like REM), and can easily pick out individual voices within a large chorus.<br />The only shortcoming is comfort, and it is not bad, just not as good as ultra-comfy open phones such as AD700s. Comfort is FAR better with these than M50s.<br /><br />I cannot more highly reccomend any pair of headphones (and I have heard many, some far more expensive. In particular, these sound better than Sennheiser HD280s and HD595s, AKG K701s, Audio Technica's own AD700s and AD900s, and Denon AH-D5000s.)<br /><br />Buy these, you will NOT regret it!

Excellent Headphones
I bought these to replace a set of Sony MDR-XD200 headphones I've been using for a year and I've been using them for about six months now.  The improvement in sound quality is amazing.  I use the headphones primarily for electronic drumming.  It's to the point where I won't even use the Sonys anymore.  It's not just me either, my wife also noticed a big difference.  You can hear things you never did with cheap headphones.<br /><br />The highs and midrange is awesome.  Bass is average, but clean.  These are amazing headphones for the price, especially the sub $60 range.  I compared these to the Bose QC2's and to me, they are very close in midrange and highs, but the Bose have slighly better bass, but of course they cost $300 and the M40's are much better built, in addition they are very comfortable.<br />

_More_ than worth the money ...
These are comfortable eight-and-a-half hours at work five days a week and then again in the evenings.  If you earn ten dollars an hour, it's not even a day's work to put out for these.  Good, solid construction, a _nice_, long cable, and large earpieces.  It stops outside sound very well, doesn't bleed _at all_, and lets you _feel_ bass notes.<br /><br />I would buy these again if I had to do it over, and will again if I ever have to.

Shut off the World
Frankly, I think these new Bose headphones put the QC-2 to shame!<br /><br />I've owned both QC-2 and QC-3 headphones for for a couple years, and their predecessor before that. My home is in a rural area that over time has become increasingly noisy with automobile traffic, chain saws, weed whackers, air travel, boats, etc, so have become a great fan of noise-cancelling headphones, which for me provide respite against all this sonic assault.<br /><br />When I read the specs of the QC-15, I thought, if these are an improvement over the QC-2, I'll have to try them. This in the face of feeling sheepish about blowing another $300 for what I feared might be a trivial difference in quality.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. When I turned on the QC-15, it was like shutting off the world. The loud rushing sound emitted by the air filter running 15 feet away became nearly inaudible, the low rumble of distant boat, air, and automobile traffic disappeared altogether. The background hiss generated by the QC-15 is noticeably quieter than the QC-2, and the noise cancellation, as Bose advertises, covers much more of the audio range. My QC-2 headset doesn't do nearly as good job at cancelling the white noise from the air filter as the QC-15, for example. <br /><br />As for sound quality, the QC-15, to my ear, has better response in the deep bass, from 25-35 hz, and les resonance in the 80-150 hz range. The bass is generally tighter as well. If you're used to the mild boominess of the QC-2, as I was, it might take you a bit of listening to appreciate the difference. In higher frequency ranges, the QC-15 seems comparable to the QC-2. My 64 year-old ears cut off arount 8 khz, so I'd defer to the judgement of younger listeners in this area.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm very happy with the improvements manifest in this new version of the Bose headphones and feel that even at $300 they're well worth it.<br /><br />The only negative criticism I can make so-far is that the headphones emit a rather loud click when you turn them on, compared to the QC-2. This is not a big deal- I just make sure to throw the ON switch before putting the phones on my head.<br /><br />By the way, many users of Bose (and other) noise-cancelling headphones complain , sometimes bitterly, about he sensation of "ear pressure" when the noise-cancelletion is activated. This is an illusion that arises because actual pressure on un-equalized eardrums (as when climbing or descending in an aircraft) has the effect of reducing the low frequency response of the eardrums. That loss of low-frequency sensitivity is read by the brain as pressure, which, in the case of altitude change, it actually is. Noise cancelling headphones drastically attenuate ambient low frequency sounds, many of which we register unconsciously. The brain interprets this as pressure on the eardrum, even though this is not actually the case. The sensation of pressure produced by noise cancellation is actually an indication of just how much very low frequency background sound we tolerate under normal circumstances. Research indicates that such low-frequency sounds can actually be a source of low-grade anxiety. Hence you may find that these headphones attenuate your nagging anxiety along with the background rumble generated by the pervasive combustion of fossil fuel all around us.

Blissful Solitude
Update:<br />After 4 months of daily use these Headphones are holding up very well (especially the headband and earcups which were crap on the QC2's).   I am still super pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Exec Summary<br />-  I highly recommend these headphones.<br />-  Good in any situation where you need to concentrate.  I could have really used these when I was in college for studying in dorms, libraries, etc.<br />-  Battery life is excellent.  I am pretty sure I have used them more than 24 hours on the original battery that came in the package and it is still going.<br />-  Music sounds great.  I have just started running thru my mp3 library but have hit on several songs that I know push the drivers pretty hard and they sound pretty damn good.<br />-  Detachable cable.  If you just want the noise cancelling, you can detach the cable and be cable free.<br /><br />If you want to know why I am giving such a positive review after only having the headphones for 6 days, read on.<br /><br />I spent a long time (weeks) researching Noise Cancelling headphones after getting moved to an office across from a computer lab with over 1000 rack mounted servers and right under its very large ceiling mounted HVAC unit.  I tried a friend's QC3's for a day and things were better (I could concentrate and not get headaches), but I found the on-ear not as comfortable and not as good at blocking the sound as I had expected for the money.  Then last Wednesday, I happened to read a Gizmodo article about how Bose was updating its Headphone lines and the 15's were arriving in store on Thursday.  So first thing Thursday morning I dropped by the local mall and tried out a pair.  I was sold after five minutes of wearing them and went straight to work to put them to work.  After installing the battery I turned them on without the cable connected and put them on.  Ah, quiet - Even the high pitch whine of the server fans was reduced by 90%.  I was able to play some background music at a very low level and I now I could hear no environmental noise what so ever.   I was still feeling guilty about spending $300; however I fell ill on Friday and had to be hospitalized.  I was placed in a room that was right next to the nurse's station (great for service, awful for noise levels).  Luckily I had brought along my Zune and my QC15's.  I spent most of my three day hospital stay listening to E-Books in blissful silence.  No bells, whistles, intercom pages, visitors talking, next door neighbors coughing, etc.   Needless to say, it's the best $300 I have ever spent.  <br />

Bose Ups the Ante
The QuietComfort 15 looks virtually identical to the 2. Only visible difference: mic holes on the chrome accents, green LED instead of red when on, different molding on the 3.5mm jack and a distinctively sculptured case of slightly different overall dimensions. Otherwise absolutely identical to the eye.<br /><br />Performance improvements, per the PC Magazine and C/Net reviews: noticeably better noise cancellation (several db better suppression of an AC unit is my only test to date), tighter bass. I believe the rated battery life is better. There does seem a tad more negative pressure. <br /><br />Certainly not a huge upgrade over the already excellent 2, but noticeable. If you can find a new home for your 2, no downside to upgrade. If you are a first time Quietcomfort buyer, a no brainer, at the same price, and superior to the 3 in my view: less comfortable to wear and I see rechargeable as a real negative - when you get on the plane and find your headphones need recharging - especially when the 15 lasts over 30 hours on a single AAA. I always carry a couple of spare AAAs in the case.<br /><br />Hot Tip: I am now using my 2 on my treadmill. My issue is my LCD TV doesn't have a headphone jack, only line out (RCA). I researched headphone amps and they are expensive to very expensive and volume control is of course on the amp itself. Bose makes an RCA to 3.5mm jack extension cable for their Wave unit, that includes volume control at the headphone end. $15. Works perfectly! Product code: 029100. Style code: HSACQA. Our local Bose store said they are in short supply, so if you like the idea, buy now!

The most comfortable headphones I've ever put on, hands down.
First off... I want potential buyers to be aware that the people downgrading (1 star) these headphones for their quality are complaining that the headphones CRACKED after YEARS of owning them... The only problem, is that these headphones have only been out for a little over a month.  I suspect that they made an honest mistake, and have the old Bose QC2's (QC15's are the newer version) which were notorious for their cheap construction on the headband.  I have only had mine for a few weeks so I cannot comment on the durability, but [...] wrote in their review that Bose had made adjustments to the headband (new design + materials I believe), and that the durability should no longer be an issue.  Hopefully that is that case.<br /><br />On to the review:<br />I went on a little shopping spree and bought the JVC HA-NC250, Klispch Image S4, and these guys (QC15) to compare them. I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I am really picky about electronics purchases... even to a fault.  I am a medical school student, and obviously don't travel extensively, but I want to be able to study at home without being distracted by my wife's music/tv/neighbors/etc, so I was in the market for some noise cancelling/isolating headphones.  The reason I chose these three headphones:  JVC were cheaper noise cancelling with decent reviews ($[...] now), the Klipsch Image S4 ($[...]) got AMAZING reviews on CNET for sound quality, so I had to see if they blocked noise sufficiently, and these were the "top of the line" headphones that I wanted to try to see if they were worth the money.  <br /><br />Regarding the comfort of these headphones... ohhh baby.  The material that they use for the earcups is AMAZING.  No clue what it is, but it is extremely plush, without being obnoxiously huge and pillowy.  I have worn the headphones for 3+ hours listening to music while studying with no discomfort, although my ears do get a little warm.  It is not really uncomfortable to me, but I could imagine if I were in a really warm room, it might be a nuisance.  I have used multiple types of earbuds, on ear headphones, and over ear headphones, and these are by far the most comfortable I've tried. Klipsch are earbuds, and fit VERY securely, but after a while they just annoy me (30+ min). JVC are more comfy than the Klipsch, but get destroyed by the Bose.  QC15 win, hands down.<br /><br />Sound quality:  In my opinion, the Klipsch earbuds sounded the best, but I think that is partly due to the extremely secure fit and tight base that is produced as a result of having them jammed in your ear canal. The obvious downside is that those bug the crap out of me after 30 minutes of use.  JVC sound quality is NOTICEABLY worse when the noise cancelling is off, and good when it's on, but I found the base kind of shallow (the battery compartment is not a pain to access like some people seem to complain about... unless you have gorilla hands).  Bose sound quality seems VERY balanced. Exceptionaly clarity, responsive/tight base, and no hissing in the background.  I did notice a little hissing when I was listening to classical music at near max volumes, but who listens to classical music at really high volumes... and it was most likely due to the sound quality of the song (download from Itunes) and not the headphones.  Overall, outstanding sound quality for the QC15.<br /><br />Noise cancelling: Bose > JVC > Klipsch.  Obviously the klipsch aren't designed to eliminate sounds, just muffle them, and they do that well, but not well enough, and as I said before, I find earbuds slightly uncomfortable.  The JVC headphones had notably worse sound-cancelling than the Bose.  It is partially due to the fact that they are on-ear instead of over-ear headphones (bose).  With the same song at equal levels I tested out both headphones while vacuuming (obviously VERY loud sound).  JVC probably knocked out about 50-60% of the sound.  The eleminate LOW frequency/pitch sounds very well, but ALL of the high ones that aren't muffled from wearing the headphones get through.  As a result, I could hear the whine of the vacuum extremely clearly.  QC15's easily eliminated 80+% of the noise.  All of the low frequency sounds were dropped, and the higher frequency sounds were noticably reduced, but not gone.  Of the 3 headphones, the bose is the clear winner.  <br /><br />Summary: <br />While I know these are obnoxiously expensive ([...] bucks for headphones is ridiculous...), I have been very impressed with these headphones.  Only gripe other than price is that noise-cancelling technology in general is unable to reduce high frequency sounds as much as I would like.  With that said, I believe that these Bose headphones provide OUTSTANDING comfort, exceptional sound (aparently some audiophile people complain that they don't match up to their 500+ dollar shures, but w/e), and among the best noise cancelling money can buy.  Also, it's wonderful that they changed over to a AAA instead of the stupid proprietary bose battery.  If I were a frequent flyer, these headphones would be a no brainer.  <br /><br />Kept the Bose, and the other two got the boot.<br /><br />(Quick side note... I have a pair of Sennheiser CX300's [earbuds], and for &lt; 20 bucks you WILL NOT find a better pair of headphones.  Comfortable by earbud standards, amazing base, clear mids/highs, unbeatable price.  I use those for running, and the Bose when studying)

Sweeps the Field in Noise Cancellation
I bought the second generation Quiet Comfort 2 headphones when they came out over 5 years ago.  While excellent, I never thought the Noise Reduction effect, was more than good.  So about 2 years ago I switched to the Sennheiser 450 Noise Guard.  While I thought the Sennheiser audio quality was a bit better than the Bose; the noise reduction was about the same or slightly not as good as the Bose.  I recently started WEEKLY air travel again in January, after 2 years of driving to a client. I became intrigued when I heard Bose had a new version of Quiet Comfort. I purchased the QC 15 on Tuesday Sept 14th  & received the QC 15 Wed Sept 15th .  I tried them for about 2 hours comparing them to my Sennheiser 450s; and then Thursday wore them from 6 PM - 3 AM Friday during a Flight on a 757 from Philly, and while being marooned at Atlanta's airport due to weather.  The QC 15 are ASTOUNDING! I was watching a movie at Midnight on my PC; and was totally unaware, that a Gate Change was announced, and luckily during a moment when I looked around, realized everyone was gone, and the area I was in was deserted!  On both my flights, the QC 15 reduced the noise, to a faint sound; and once I put music on, the background noise was 100% GONE!  I read numerous reviews about the "Bose" sound, that there's slight Base and High Distortion at very high personal listening levels, with the QC 15 headphones, and that they are average audio quality.  For my general purposes, I noticed NO distortion, and really enjoyed the bright, large Bose soundstage, the really great high end, pleasant audio in my opinoin; very clear track separation, no muddiness of sound.  I also noticed I had to keep the volume 1 to 2 notches below any other headphones, because Bose sounded equally as loud as other headphones at a lower volume.  After more in-depth reading, I discovered that the Bose warranty Department would let me trade up my 5 year old QC 2s, due to a crack in the right plastic joint of that model which was a known issue.  I also learned that while the QC 15s look essentially the same as the original QC 2s; there has been iterative model changes to the material and reinforcement, over the last 5 years, that make the QC 15s a quality construction, for truly lasting enjoyment.  Bose stands behind their products ANYTIME there is a failure.  Bose is not perfect, nor are their products perfect, but they strive for PERFECT customer satisfaction.  Despite all you read in any review, I truly believe the QC 15s are a solid product; that anyone would be happy to own; and are a near flawless implementation of Noise Cancelling technology; when compared to Sennheiser, Shure, Sony and Panasonic.  I own or have extensively used all of the competing products, and with each of the other brands, I am comparing the high end models of the Sony NC 500 at $399. and the Shure 530 at originally $500.  There is no white noise, no pops, great sound, light weight, secure fit, comfort with longtime wearing of the Bose headphones, when compared to the other brands. You would save money when compared to all other brands, even at the $299 price.  You do get what you pay for!  Enjoy!

Five Stars for Noise Reduction and Comfort
I own very high end audiophile headphones, so my interest in the QuietComfort 15 phones really is in their noise reduction/cancellation capabilities and comfort, rather than their audio performance.  For this reason, the five stars I have given relates to those features, and not to the QC15's audio playback capability.  Even though I am a rather picky consumer, I am completely satisfied with this product.   I have not used these headphones to listen to music or other audio, so I would turn to other folks' reviews for that.      <br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, I did not pay full price for the QC15s.  Rather, I traded-in my old set of QuietComfort 2 phones (bought around five years ago or longer) for the QC15 under Bose's trade-in program, so I got these for half price.  While I'm not sure I would have paid full price for the QC15s, I think (of course, that's easy for me to say) that they are worth their high price, at least with respect to the features I was looking for.   Again, I can't comment on their audio capabilities.    <br /><br />Comparing the QC15 to the QC2s, there is no doubt in my mind that the QC15 are a much, much better set of noise reducing phones.  I barely used the QC2s due to their lack of comfort.  In particular, right out of the box, I felt quite a bit of pressure on my ears wearing them, and I was not overly impressed by their noise reduction/cancellation.  (I was also not very impressed by their audio playback capability.)  Also, and this may just have been me, but I experienced vertigo at times with the QC2s, so they essentially just sat on my shelf unused.  The QC2s also gave off a slight high pitch sound when the noise reduction feature was on.<br /><br />I have not had any problems like that (knock wood) with the QC15.  I've worn the QC15 for a couple of full business days straight on through (with occasional breaks) and I do not find them to be fatiguing at all.  From a comfort standpoint, the QC15 seem to use a different, softer type of material for their padding.  They feel more lightweight, and I also don't really experience the "sweaty ear" syndrome that I did with the QC2s. The real test, of course, is whether they really reduce ambient sounds.  Well, I work in a very loud area in NYC, and the phones reduce external sounds immensely, without (and I think this is a big plus) completing eliminating them.   For example, as I'm typing this, there are three extremely loud jackhammers outside my window.  With the QC15s on, I barely hear them at all, although I am still aware of my surroundings.  In fact, to me, complete external sound cancellation would be disconcerting - I want to know what's out there, I just don't want to be bothered by it.  With the QC15, I'm still able to hear the phone or doorbell ring, etc.  <br /><br />While I haven't taken them on the plane with me yet, I think they would work similarly well. The carrying case is not tiny, but it will pack very nicely in your take-on baggage.  The phones run stock on a single nonrechargeable AAA battery, and the case can hold a couple of spares (and an i-phone or similar device). <br /><br />While I will try them out sometime down the road on music (they can plug into iphones and other mobile devices), I don't think I'd be able to provide a fair review, given my other headphones, so I'll leave reviewing their audio qualities to others.

Amazing Noise Reduction
I have used noise canceling headphones for about 5-6 years, so I know how they work and the degree to which they will lessen noise, as well as what type of noise they will lessen.  I have always been interested in the Bose QC2 but never invested the $$ because of the breakage problem, plus the phones I was using were, I thought, pretty much as good as it was going to get for noise cancellation.  I read about the QC 15's and their new technology, and also that the headpiece had been redesigned so as not to break so easily, and the fact that there is now a single cord, not a Y-cord, which I hate.  I decided to go ahead and take the plunge.<br /><br />I could not believe the noise reduction the first time I put them on.  They reduced much more noise than any noise-cancelling headphones I've ever used.  Just the passive resistance (the improved ear cups) is noticeable, but I was in a small bedroom with a pretty noisy window air conditioner and a fan, and once I put the headphones on, literally 6-7 feet from the a/c, I could not hear it at all, or the fan either.  I was shocked that they could block noise that well.  The next thing I tried was the TV.  Like all noise-cancelling headphones, they don't cancel out all noise, and certainly not voices, but their blockage of voices is again more than my previous two pair of NC headphones.  I would say there is a significant difference in reduction of all types of noise when compared to my previous headsets, but again as with any NC headphones, they don't completely cancel out voices.<br /><br />As far as music, well I'm not a super-picky audiophile in terms of music quality.  I think my music sounds slightly better than my other headphones, but not incredibly, spectacularly better.  But then, I bought the headphones strictly for their noise-canceling ability, and any improvement in sound of music would be a bonus for me.  The music does sound quite good.  I'm extremely satisfied with my QC 15's.

The Sound of Silence
Ok, I know they are ridiculously expensive.  I remember saying I would never buy headphones that cost so much.  And I did try out the Bose Quietcomfort1 and 2 in stores more than once.  Both did a decent job at noise canceling, but certainly to my mind not worth the cost.  So I bought a pair of Jensen noise canceling headphones from a kiosk at the airport for $50 and they worked reasonably well for quite a few years.  Finally, the cord is beginning to fray where it connects to the phones, the earpieces are falling apart, and the noise canceling does not seem to make much difference anymore.  So I went the total cheap route and bought a pair of Cobys for $29.  Actually quite comfortable, but the noise canceling is simply a rather loud and annoying hiss which I guess is supposed to pass for white noise.<br /><br />Then came the new Bose Quiet Comfort 15.  In the airport again, I tried out a pair at a kiosk.  Immediately I was impressed with the extent of the noise canceling of the sounds around the kiosk.  I still could not justify the price, so for the next few weeks I looked around for an alternative.  I read review after review, tried out some other highly rated headphones as well.  I read that some audiophiles don't like the Bose because of the base and warm tones.  I thought about going for another $50 closeout set of phones listed on Amazon, but comfort was an issue according to the reviews.   I tried to find the Bose discounted with no luck.  Finally I bit the bullet and bought the new Bose, covered by the 30 day satisfaction guarantee.<br /><br />My first airplane trip using the new headphones, I could not believe my ears.  My seat was right next to the engine and the noise was LOUD.  After takeoff I put on the headphones and the engine noise was not just mitigated, it disappeared.  I mean I truly could not hear it anymore.  I took them off and I realized how truly ear splitting that engine noise can be.  I put them on again and the noise disappeared again.  Joy! For the rest of the flight I kept them on and frankly did not want to take them off.  I have no claims to be an audiophile, but the sound is as good as any headphones (noise canceling or not) I have owned.  I personally like the warm base, but that is a personal preference.  As to comfort, I can wear them for hours and hardly feel a thing (the Jensen used to cause my temples to ache).  The bottom line is that if you want the best active noise canceling, bar none, the Bose should be your choice.  And now I can say honestly they are worth every penny.<br /><br />Addendum: Just today I was wearing the headphones in the local public library doing some work on my computer, and one of the librarians approached me.  I saw her out of the corner of my eye, so I took off the headphones, and the librarian said, "Is that your phone making that noise?"  Sure enough my cell phone was ringing loud and clear in my pocket (I keep it on the highest ringer setting) and I did not even hear it with the Bose QuietComfort 15 on.  They continue to amaze me with the extent of their noise canceling.<br />

Like being in a desert
I had been a longtime user of the original Bose QuietCofmort 1 headphones before I bought the QC 15.   Granted, the QC 1 worked really well both in terms of noise reduction and music performance.  Eventually its ear foams came off completely which led me into looking for a new headset.  Although I had orginally planned to buy either a QC2 or QC3 last week, I learned during my research that Bose had just released a brand new headset, the QuietComfort 15, and was advertised as having a better noise canceling technology than all its previous headsets, including those of its competitors.   I ordered them in a drop of a hat and here I have them today.  <br /><br />I am wearing my QC15 as I am writing this review and I feel that I am in the middle of a desert...all quiet, no urban sounds whatsoever, and you actually listen to silence itself as you would in the middle of nature.  When I had the QC 1, it provided plenty of noise reduction, but it was not really the silence you get from being in the desert....rather, it was a very low "hissing" sound which shielded you from noise pollution... but with the QC15, there is not even a "hiss" anymore...it's just pure silence.   <br /><br />This headset is so good that at one point it fooled me into believing that the breeze from one of the house fans was a natural one from outside.   As I was about to check if I had left any windows open, I came across to discover that it was only a fan blowing (duuuh). Wow! The noise of the fan did not exist with these headphones!  <br /><br />As for musical performance, what can I say?  They provide the standard Bose sound to your ears.  If you already own a previous Bose QC model, then the sound won't be anything significantly new to you (at least I haven't seen any major differnece from my QC 1).  But if this will be your first Bose QuiectComfort headset, then by all means go to your nearest retailer that carries these and try them out.  And even if you buy without trying them out, there is a very good chance you will be happy you bought them.  Well worth the purchase and highly recommended!

Very comfortable; decent sound quality; trade up to save money
I just traded in my Quiet Comfort 2's for these QC 15's.  My comparison between the two follows.  <br /><br />Durability.  The reason I traded my old "2"s in was that the side "arm" broke, despite my very gentle use of them.  I took them into the Bose store, and they acknowledged that the breaking side arms was a common problem.  They also assured me that the QC15's have been upgraded and fortified not once but twice since the particular version of the QC2's that I previously owned.  They say this one is much more durable; I suppose time will tell.<br /><br />Price.  You should know that if you are upgrading from QC2, as I am, you can trade them in at the Bose store and get one hundred fifty dollars off your purchase of the QC15's.  Technically, they have to be defective, but my salesman told me that just me stating that they were defective would be good enough for them.<br /><br />Sound.  The noise cancelling seems a bit better than the QC2's to my ear.  I played a couple songs with heavy bass and it came through quite distorted on the QC15's.  If you care about rich bass, you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />Case.  It's a bit sexier than the old QC2 case.

listening to audio books made easier
Had a great idea some time ago, why don't I listen to audio books when I'm working out at the fitness center?  Well it is a good idea except when there is a lot of distracting room noise, especially near-by conversations and TVs. I looked into noise-canceling headphones and bought the Bose QC 15. Well it is the literal night and day difference.  The constant sounds of machines are all but eliminated and periodic noises like conversations are well muted.   The audio is just fine with good dynamic range and bass response. $300 is a hell a of a lot of money for earphones but these things really work.

Best over the ear Noise Cancelling Headphones Evar!
Purchased directly from the Bose physical store, rather than through Bose store on Amazon.<br /><br />A lot has been said about these headphones already, and I'm no audiophile, but having travelled a lot on business, I've had the excuse of owning quite a nubmer of noise cancelling headphones: the earliest were Sony NC-1 in the ear buds that I bought in Japan in 2000.  The NC-1's are still my favourite in-the-ear headphone buds, though they don't block as much noise as I often need; so I've always been searching for the ideal fully enclosed, over-the-ear, headphones.<br /><br />I've used some of the previous Bose products before - the original QC was good, though too bulky for my liking.  The QC3 were less effective at noise cancellation than my NC1s due to their design sitting on top of the ear rather than fully enclosing them  - so my interest was piqued by these these newer fully over-the-ear headphones from Bose.  I decided to try them out at the local Bose store here in Seattle and bought them on the spot.  After 3 days I am still extremely happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Lightest, most comfortable, over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones I've ever tried. I can wear them for 3+ hours and not notice.<br />+ Noise cancellation quality is great.  Not only for plane wind/engine but also for desktop PC fans and general office noise.  No irritating buzz, though you do get the usual "dead air" feeling - a GoodThing(tm) in my opinion<br />+ Comfortable enough to lean head against airplane seat with minimal sound transfer from the seat into the inner headphone inner acoustic space.<br />+ No cable required.  I often like to work in complete quiet and the lack of cable just removes another thing which can get tangled up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- These are active headphones.  No battery means no sound.  Luckily the AAA battery I've been using for > 20 hours seems to still be going strong.  I would recommend keeping a spare in the case though.<br />- Case is rather big for frequent travellers.  Often I will day-trip with a shoulder bag and these consume a lot more space than I budgeted for - not a slight on Bose as these fold down as much as they likely can without compromising comfort.  Though worth noting if you're a light traveller.<br />- Price: These are expensive.  <br /><br />If you can afford them, travel a lot and/or require quiet to work, or know someone who does then I unreservedly recommend you to buy these.  Truly great.<br /><br />Hope this helps, Mike

QC2++
I've been a happy owner of the QC2s for many years, until a few weeks ago when the plastic sleeve around the adjustable headband broke (apparently a common problem). Not wanting to invest in a new pair of QC2s with this design defect, I started trying other products (Sony, Sennheiser, Monster, etc.) but didn't like any of them. Then I noticed a few days ago that the QC15 was available, so I brought my iPod (and the broken QC2s) to a local Bose store and had a listen. What a difference! The noise canceling is much more complete, the clarity of the sound is much better, less iPod volume is required, and to my delight, Bose has also made a slight redesign of the headband sleeve in response to the previous high failure rate. Best of all, thanks to the "exchange program", the cost of the upgrade was only $150. If you want the best, get these.<br />

Exceptional noise cancelling, exceptional sound quality; definately worth the price.
After researching the Sennheiser PXC450s and these headphones, I chose the Bose QC15s. <br /><br />Why I chose the Bose:<br />-The sound quality is fantastic.<br />-Both Sennheiser and Bose were very comparable in price and specifications, with the Sennheisers being slightly larger but the padding on the Bose being more comfortable.  <br />-The Bose has a longer battery life of approx 36 hours (40 hours and counting here).  <br />-The Bose can be used only for noise canceling, which they do extraordinarily well, and the cord detaches (convenient for sleeping on flights).  I've noticed a slight pressure in my right eardrum while not listening to music; the pressure is slight and isn't enough to cause discomfort. There is no pressure when listening to music.<br />-The case is well-constructed and has room for carrying an mp3 player and additional AAA batteries. <br /><br />After running 40 hours of "noise" through the headphones, the sound quality and frequency response does seem to be greatly improved, with a more realistic experience, almost like being center-stage at a concert.  And, after 40 hours, the original AAA battery that came with the headset is still powering the noise-canceling feature.  For truly enjoying music, these are the headphones that I would recommend.<br /><br />

My ears are now the happiest part of my body...
I used to own a set of QC2 headphones, and I really liked them. I brought them everywhere. Unfortunately, I lost them during a hectic day at Heathrow earlier this year. I just received the QC15 as a gift to replace them and let me just say: WOW. A landmark product has been surpassed in every way: sound quality, comfort, noise reduction... even the carrying case is slicker! <br /><br />Inside your lovely quiet bubble, free of drones, tones, and the buzzzz of modern life... it's like listening to a $10000 stereo set in an acoustically perfect soundproof room. Noise reduction? I'm standing right next to my dishwasher and I can't even tell it's on.. and it's a old beast of a machine lol. Yet people speaking to me from across the room are easily distinguishable. It really shuts out all the garbage without disconnecting you from your surroundings. How often do you get real pleasure from wearing headphones when they're not even plugged into anything??<br /><br />If there's a better sounding, better noise-canceling set of 'phones out there, I would be amazed. I know of no better way to enjoy music! As an amateur musician and professional in post-production, I give these my highest recommendation.

Fantastic
I own the original model of the Bose noise canceling earphones, as well as a pair of small folding Senheiser noise canceling phones.  This new Bose model is clearly a step up from the original Bose, not to mention not having the separate battery and electronics case that was part of the original.  The level of sound isolation seems phenomenal, though I have yet to wear them on a plane flight.  If quiet is all you want, the cord to a sound source can be removed entirely.  They do not fold, but the ear cups do rotate so that the device packs flat.  It comes with a well designed, form fitting travel case (as well as a supply of business cards describing the phones you can give to envious fellow travelers!).  I was pleased to find that there is room inside the case for an iPod as well as the phones.  <br /><br />I cannot truly judge the sound quality from an audiophile standpoint; I am a 71 year old man with good hearing for my age, but my high frequency hearing is unquestionably age-impaired.  Given that, however, I find the sound quality to be good.  The phones are on the heavy side, but not excessively so for their size.  This may become a problem after wearing them for long periods, however.  Also, I find that the closed, ear-surrounding ear cups become noticeably warm.<br /><br />One drawback that must be mentioned is that Bose phones cannot be used in a non-cancelling mode, or with a dead battery.  This can be a significant issue if one has not planned ahead and packed an extra battery or two inside the case.  At this point, I cannot say how long a battery will last in use.  <br /><br />Overall, the biggest drawback to these phones is their size.  They and the case take up a significant amount of space in a briefcase or purse.  In return, however, one gets the extreme sound isolation provided and good quality sound if one wants to listen to music or podcasts while using them at home or on the road.

Trade-up at Bose store smooth
If you like over-the-ear headphones like I do: QC15 is the new noise-canceling gold standard.<br /><br />I bought a pair of QC2's at Amazon 2.5 years ago - loved them. But the noise-canceling just quit working about 6 months ago. A sad day. When I heard about the new QC15's and the trade program, I went down to the local Bose store. <br /><br />I told the sales guy the noise-canceling had quit; he tried them on, yes, he says. So for $160-including-tax I walk out with my old QC2 case and cable (kept as spares), and my new QC15s in their new case. A happy day.<br /><br />Wow. Bose QC headphones are expensive. But they are the noise-canceling gold standard. Love 'em. The QC15's are even quieter than the QC2's were when the QC2's were working.

A slightly different perspective
I usually do not review stuff, but I rely on the reviews to make selections.  I am vocal about not writing reviews without ample experience with the product when I rarely provide feedback to a reviewer.  So why did I stop lurking and decide to write a review?  Why am I breaking my own rule about spending some time with an item before telling others to buy it (or not)?  Simply, I am really impressed with my introduction to this product.  I have never had noise canceling earphones.... ever.  It is for that reason I am writing this.  If you are not familiar with this technology, I am here to tell you these things really do the job!  I sit in a cubicle that is at one of the noisiest parts of the building I occupy.  I sit across from a data center and its constant din; on a main aisle that has constant traffic with cell phone and hallway conversations and impromptu meetings; cube neighbors that talk loudly and in different languages (Non-English speakers talk even louder, thinking no one can understand them anyhow); offices across from me whose occupants will not close their doors for meeting or conference calls, not that I am going to tell them to! Add to that the fact that I write for my main job.  This means I need to read docs and write docs all day!  For this there is a substantial concentration requirement. I tell you I was going nuts here.  But not now, nope, not now.  These earphones have saved my job and my sanity.  $300.00 is a mere price to pay (trust me; I am sucking wind at the cost (no lunches for a spell)). So, if you have the price and the need, spend the money and save all the anguish I suffered.  Thanks to all of you who took the time to help me decide. Like I said earlier, I really rely on the reviews that users provide. I have to add that I find the music through these crisp, clear and alive.  Good balance of sound, and the quieting circuits make it seem so much better.  WOW!

Must have for frequent flyers
I had the QC2s for approximately 4 years and absolutely loved them. Then I encountered the dreaded problem of one can not working which had been reported as a common problem. Even though my QC2s were three years out of warranty Bose still gave me a 50% discount on the QC15s since I had the dead can on my QC2s. The new ones are noticeably better on noise reduction as well as fidelity. I'm now ready for our European vacation next week!

Bose lives up to the reputation
These headphones were worth every penny.<br /><br />I didn't used to be a big fan of noise canceling headphones - instead opting for the Shure e2c's in the past (also a great pair), but I needed noise canceling phones because my work environment is bustling.<br /><br />These headphones made a big difference in my ability to concentrate. They're durable, very comfortable (I took a star off comfort only because they're not great over glasses, but still much better than other over-ear phones), and the noise-canceling feature produces clear sound while drowning out background chatter and noise. <br /><br />My taste is rock, blues, and classical, and I was happy with the sound reproduction with all three genres. <br /><br />They're an expensive set of headphones, and I tried Audio Technica's prior to this purchase for a less expensive option, but once I heard the Bose, I didn't hesitate to make the purchase. Definitely worth it.

Oh the sweet sound of silence
I do not spend much time listening to music, but I really enjoy the silence that allows me to read and think without the interruptions around me. I wish I had these years ago.

Considerably better than the QC2 and QC3
These are fantastic headphones and are considerably better at reducing low frequency noises like jet engines, wind, and road noise than the prior version (The QC2).  They are very comfortable, and like the QC2s before them, come with a nice carrying case that can also hold an Ipod or other MP3 player.<br /><br />I've been using noise cancelling ("NC") headphones since I purchased my first pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2's about 7 years ago.  NC headphones are great for eliminating both road noise when going on long car trips and for eliminating engine and wind noise when flying on commercial airliners.  None of the noise cancelling headphones on the market today are good at cancelling out noise from people talking, babies crying, etc., and so if you're looking for something to do that, you'll be unhappy with any NC headphone, including these.<br /><br />After I owned the QC2 for a while, I compared them to comparable products from Sennheiser (PXC-250) and Sony.  My verdict then was that the QC2's were better, but the Sennheisers (PXC-250) were also quite good, particularly considering the price difference (the Sennheiser model was about $100 back then).  I found the Sony models to be way too heavy and too small for my head.<br /><br />A few years later, Bose put out the QC3, which was as good as the QC2, but required you to use a proprietary rechargeable battery.  The QC3 was also a bit smaller than the QC2 and did not completely cover year ear.  I'm against proprietary rechargeables, because they are expensive, and you will often find yourself with a dead battery and no way to charge them.  The QC2's used standard AAA batteries, which allows me to use standard alkaline or re-chargeable Nichel Metal Hydride batteries.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see that the QC15's don't continue the trend towards expensive, proprietary batteries.  Instead, they use standard AAA's, just like the QC2s.  Even better, the QC15 is considerably better at noise reduction than the QC2.  If you can spare $300, it's well worth the upgrade.<br /><br />If you can't afford $300, the $100 Sennheiser PXC-250 is a very good second choice.  The PXC-250 does not cover your ears, and so it won't really block out any external noise.  In contrast, the QC15's do cover your ears and thus have some noise reduction just by virtue of the fact that they cover your ears.<br /><br />In either case, I highly recommend that you purchase Eneloop rechargeable batteries, which keep their charge for up to a year when not used, and a La Crosse BC-900 charger, both of which you can buy at Amazon.com.<br />

The best thing my ears have ever heard
<br />In this review: an in depth comparison of Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 THX, Logitech Z-2300 THX, Bose Soundock,  Bose Companion 3's, Bose Companion 5's and  Altec Lansing t-612<br /> <br />Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I'd like to offer a review somewhat different than what you've read before.  It's a long one so if you're looking for something quick, you may want to stop here.  Otherwise hopefully you'll enjoy the perspective.  My thanks go out to those who let us know who you are and what you do in your review, and how you use the system, it really makes a difference.  It's important to know the story behind why someone is buying something and what they are looking to do, otherwise you get mismatched needs and solutions.  My story begins during the first month of 2008, when I got myself  into a bit of a speaker craze while searching for a sound solution for every room of my house.  Three years ago I put my life's music collection in digital format on iTunes to the tune of over 5000 songs with perhaps the widest array of music than anyone else I know: Jazz, Hip-hop, R&B, trip hop, electronica, techno, country, audio books, Tony Robbins, metal, rock, dub, enigma type stuff, lounge, new-aje, world music, caribbean, Latin and on the list goes.  So, when I say I've tested these speakers over a wide variety of music, you can take my word for it.  <br /><br />My demographic: Male, business owner (custom Italian leather journals, guest books and photo albums: see epica . com ) and hip-hop dancer choreographer, 30 years old, Southern California.  Creative, very into pleasing the senses.  <br /><br />After growing up with stereo systems that catered to more bass than clarity, my initial goal was to discover what would be the most clear, best, space filling rich sound I could in each room of the house while still being incredibly aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive at the best price.  I wanted to turn up the volume and be amazed at what I heard without any distortion and I wanted to be thrilled at the lowest volumes as well. I wanted to feel like I was there, to have a music experience every time I turned something on.  The best price part went out the door rather quickly.  <br /><br />So here's what I did:  Apple sells a device called an Airport Express that among other things such as being a wireless router, also allows you to stream iTunes music to it wirelessly.  All you have to do is plug in a stereo mini plug to one end and an audio source to another.  Give it a name like living room and it appears in iTunes. you can have several of these devices all over the house.  In the past I have always hooked up big stereos or shelf systems to it for sound but now in the age of tiny computer speakers and iPod doc systems, I've realized you can connect anything to it and have taken the experience to a whole new level.  There are now 4 airport expresses in the house in different rooms along with an apple TV which also features this Airtunes feature in the living room,  bedroom, second bedroom, kitchen and hallway... yes the hallway.<br /><br />After having spent hours in the Apple Store and Best Buy listening to different sound docks and speakers with my iPhone and collection of music, I just decided to purchase and used every single unit that caught my interest with the decision that those which didn't give me everything I was looking for, I'd just return. (The manufacturers must love me.)  Because what can you really tell about a speaker or sound system in a 30,000 foot warehouse with sound and people all around you?  Are you kidding? Nothing. You've really got to setup these systems in your environment.  <br /><br />It's also important that you test your purchase in different places and positions all throughout your house. You won't believe the difference in sound from having  say, a SounDock in your bathroom vs. a bedroom.  Move the subwoofer around, adjust the bass on it, move the speakers, be creative. you'll surprise yourself.  <br /><br />Finally, a word about Bose.  Of all the sound companies that I read reviews for, and I read about 400 before making a purchase, I have never seen such a contrasting fan base.  You've got people who detest anything Bose and people who would buy it without listening to anything else. For the record I am neither of these people.  I have owned Bose products in the past and enjoyed them as I have with other companies but was not biased towards or against them prior to purchase.<br /><br />The Systems: <br /><br />The Klipsch Prop-Media 2.1 speakers were my purchase. I was attracted to what I knew about the Brand, the subwoofer control on the actual satellite speaker and the $150 price point.  I got them home and aesthetically I was just never really attracted to the speaker.  My place has a very Asian-Zen and modern feel and these just kind of stood out in the wrong way wherever I placed them.  But we're talking about sound so I looked past that. It's got a pretty large subwoofer, and the satellites where small enough to go anywhere. Klipsch does a great job with their horn tweeters and it really let's the highs soar.  I tried them in my home office and bedroom for a week before I returned them.  Why? <br />I loved that they were THX, which means there was no hissing whatsoever and they were dead quiet when music was shut off.  I was also pleased and could not  believe the power. These speakers have so much gain and get so loud, that I don't think full volume would even be tolerable to the human ear. But that was the thing. They seemed to distort at the higher volumes I tend to enjoy and didn't seem to fill a room at low volumes. The subwoofer is recommended to be set at 8 o'clock (very low) and if you adjust that any higher the bass is quite over powering.  The sound coming from the Klipsch speakers was not a bad or poor sound, it was great, it was ridiculously powerful but it just wasn't the best sound I had heard for music. They ultimately went back to the store,  and I give them a 4 star rating, but I'd be open to trying them in again in a different setting.  I think I found them to be to cumbersome as well.<br /><br />To their credit, RoomGroove wireless for $300, is their latest version of what I am doing with the airport express where you can link multiple room grooves up and they'll wireless send sound to each other. Points to them for finally getting something like this on the market.  <br /><br />Logitech Z-2300 THX: WOW.  I was a little biased at first because I thought, Logitech? Really? The people who shine at making wireless mice and keyboards? How can they compare to these other big sound companies? What can they possibly bring to the table?   Five stars no question. Here I had nothing to go on other than the $150 price point. I brought them home and unpacked. Ok, the subwoofer with this speaker set is not for the faint of heart. It is absolutely enormous and well suited for a larger office or larger room.  It's got two attractive enough (without the grills) aluminum speakers, and a similar wired remote to the Bose only this has the subwoofer control on it (fortunately) and a headphone jack. (no external auxiliary mini plug) <br /><br />Where to begin. This system has started off in and remains to this day in my office.  At low volumes it is rich, deep, clear, and not overpowering in any respect. The music soars no matter what you're listening to.  It's an absolute pleasure to sit before these speakers and  I should start leaving them playing some sort of music more often because it really really sounds tremendous.  And that's only the beginning.  <br /><br />Once the staff goes home and I can crank these up, every wall in the building shakes.  The other bathrooms sound as though there is an earthquake and we should evacuate the building. I know it sounds like I'm a big bass person but this is the least of my desires. The clarity, much like the companion 5's just keeps getting richer and richer as you turn the volume up. Artist's vocals scream out at you and this system is the loudest of any I have heard. Interestingly it's also the most tolerable at high volume that I have heard as well. <br /><br />I love the fact that it's got RCA jacks for speaker cables which allow you to easily extend them if you want them more than a few inches apart or want to place the subwoofer farther away than right at your feet.   I love the power and clarity of these speakers, I love that the remote has the bass on the module and you don't have to adjust it behind the subwoofer.  Five golden stars are easily awarded. Go Logitech. <br /><br />Altec Lansing T-612 and Bose SounDock Portable: <br />Having tested the Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks, JBL On Stage, Klipsch iGroove, the Zeppelin monster, iHome, logitech pure fi and many others, these are the two I wound up bringing home.  <br /><br />Technology is great. We give birth to new ideas which create new ways we listen to music like iPods and iTunes, and that stimulates thought to a new level and we create devices made especially just for these things like the wide array of docking stations, something we had no need for in the past, and then we give birth to new ideas again and say wouldn't it be great to have our music collection on our phone and eliminate devices, and that get's created, and one company wins out over all the others and soon that creates a new problem: cell phone interference and shielding and that gives birth to the first of a new line of products: the iPhone safe Altec T-612.  The first docking station to not be affected by sound interference from cell phones.  <br /><br />It worked well. I give it 5 stars for innovation, sound, it's own bass and treble controls on the unit that can be controlled by the remote control, size and a pretty unique look. (Which I am personally not attracted to) This purchase lasted 24 hours before it was returned. It was going to be used as a hallway speaker and so probably would not get much use out of the iPod Dock.  It goes for $200 which seems reasonable.  Ultimately though it did not have the fullness and richness, or spaciousness that the Bose did, and the bass cracked on several songs.  This is perfect for a teen, or college person or someone who just listens to music here and threre at reasonable volumes in the kitchen or around the house. <br /><br />Bose SounDock Portable.  FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS, and no sale or special pricing. Certainly you have to have a unique perspective on money to purchase one of these for yourself.  One now resides in my bedroom and another in the hallway so certainly I'll share mine.  Are there alternatives on the market that you will be happy with? Absolutely.  $400 is a lot of money to spend on a device like this. Or is it?  I sell a $10,000 journal on the Epica website,  I have seen $12,000 pens, $400,000 automobiles, $200 for torn up jeans (and that's just a normal brand), $12 to see a movie, $50 for a tank of gas, $4000 for a high end washer and dryer... look at the world we live in.  Certainly dollar for dollar you are not paying for the product itself or the metal, cotton or components, EVER, but the value it brings to you. The features and luxuries and benefits it brings.  The feeling. And that always has a price.  <br /><br />How many times have you shopped for the best deal on something, bought it, and then later wished you had purchased the better version, or gotten the special optional features, or wish you had just splurged after the fact. How many times have you not been able to do it like when you purchase a car? I have just gotten myself used to two things. One: happiness comes from your thoughts and your ability to keep your mind and focus on things that please you, not from objects you buy, and two, the fact that if contrast has caused me to give birth to a desire for wanting something, and I think in the obtaining of it I will be more pleased in owning it than the less expensive version,  I am going to buy the one that brings me the most pleasure and gives me personally, the best feeling.  <br /><br />Need, purpose, design, size and functionality all coalesced with the SounDock and so I spent 200 more dollars after I returned the Lansing for something that would be kept in my hallway which pointed into the bathroom.  But it was more discreet, it had a revolving iPod dock that I could hide from view when not using it, a remote control that let me change my playlists (that most remotes do not do), a look that was much more attractive and streamline, and a sound that was just richer and fuller.  <br /><br />And while it pains me immensely to know that I took the two-hundred heart pounding watts of Klipsch out of my bedroom, the amazing, clear, spacious and dynamic sound of the Bose Companion 3s out of my bedroom and now have replaced those with another SounDock, portable, it certainly does create magic in the bedroom.  Aside from two lamps, it is the ONLY other wire in the room. It's small, and doubles as my alarm clock. I LOVE the  fact that I can wake up to any song or play list in the world.   using an iPod  (I am very put off by Apple's decision to not have a snooze button on iPod alarm, while it is on the iPhone, however on the iPhone you can only wake up to a ringtone! Silly)  I love how it fills a room and how if you're not in the room you hear it loud and clear and would have no idea something so small is producing all that sound.  <br /><br />I have really come to appreciate Bose. They create the best sound they can possibly engineer by pouring 100% of their profits back into research and deliver the best product they can that generally takes years to release. They think their sound sounds best flat, with no adjustment. That's what the EQ is for on the iPod or iTunes or whatever source you're using. They realize you shouldn't have to tweak all the treble and bass if the sound is just amazing to begin with.  It's all about the feeling you get when you listen to it.  The SounDock does not sound as good as a system like the Companion  3's or any other subwoofer driven device but you have to look at it's purpose and size.<br /><br />SounDock gets five stars for listening to customer requests and making their successful SounDock portable even better by adding the aux in port so I can hear music wirelessly, a great remote with lots of functionality, discreet touch volume buttons,  a hideaway revolving dock door to make it look even cleaner than it already does, a great room filling sound, a battery that lasts, a slimmer design, a power cord that wraps around the transformer and an overall sound that makes you feel very good when listening to it.  Try placing one of these things in your kitchen, hall, bathroom, closet or smaller room and listen to the rumble and sound. Amazing.  <br /><br />Bose Companion 3's: When I first set these up in my office I was absolutely amazed by the quality and quantity of sound coming out of these speakers.  They are gorgeous, discrete and fit the bill for big sound.  I was impressed by the fact that I could turn them up to full volume, with any kind of music and here no distortion of any kind. That one fact is so rare, that made them a winner for me right there.  When listening to Diana Krall, I felt as though her lips where inches from my ear as she sang only to me.   These speakers really sing out.  <br />For some reason when I tried watching movies on them, the volume decreased significantly and so even at full blast the sound was not that loud. Over time these speakers have moved from office to bedroom to ultimately being returned to the store but not  because I was dissatisfied. I kept these things in my closet for 3 weeks because I didn't want to return them, I wanted to find a use for them or somewhere to enjoy them.  They went back because I didn't want 5 cords in my bedroom and a subwoofer at the foot of my bed.  <br /><br />Like the companion 5's, I like the puck volume control  (would be nice if it was wireless, wouldn't it? Especially if everything else on your desk is).  It's very sensitive and feels good to touch. One gentle tap and sound is muted, another and it comes back on.  It's also nice to be able to increase or decrease the bass that pours out of these units on the back of the subwoofer by virtually a full 360 degrees.    I am also pleased with the RCA jacks used to connect each speaker. Initially I was put off and wondered why they did it but when I realized how EFFORTLESS (one of my favorite words) it was to extend the speaker cable, i.e.  just plug in another video cable, I was thrilled.  Five stars to the Companion 3s <br /><br />Bose Companion 5's: It's funny how when you don't know what you're missing, you don't miss it.  I tell people that in my business that when you buy this $185 journal and you haven't seen the $265 version, you think you're in heaven. It's perfection.  Then you see the top of the line and you just can't imagine it gets any better. The Companion 5's are nearly triple the size of the Companion 3's (Yet still rather small and attractive), look absolutely gorgeous next to my iMac, have the same puck with mute, headphones, volume up and down and auxiliary input just like the Companion 3's (which will play something at simultaneously as what you have going on your computer).<br /><br />BUT there are two major differences in these speakers vs anything else I have heard, ever. One is it connects to your USB port, not your stereo mini plug in port which requires 2 minutes of configuring, and two, the sound that comes out of these speakers is the most delicious, exquisite, full, wide, spacious, rich, detailed sound I have EVER heard come out of speakers in this class.  Anyone I have shared them with leaves with their jaw on the floor. As I turn up the volume we just stare at the computer and say WOW.  It just sucks you in. Where  before I did not enjoy spending time in front of the computer for very long, I can literally spend hours in front of this one or in the room where the Companion 5's are playing. The sound is that unbelievable.  The cables as of this writing are proprietary and cannot be extended, however for the `surround effect' it's not recommended that you extend them anyway.  <br /><br />I enjoy barely audible volume levels in the morning but come nighttime, I love to crank up the sound and  speakers can take it at a volume so loud you can only take it for a short period. It's as though with each increment you raise the volume, you experience a new dimension to sound.  The Bose Companion 5's for this purpose get 5 stars, 10 if I could, for looks, size and for a sound like no other.  <br /><br />Finally, don't be led astray by the Bose advertising. These speakers are marketed towards people who like to watch movies in front of their computer, something that, after spending all day in front of a computer, is the last thing I want to do.   I've tried it and yes it's a great experience but if you never watch a video clip with these speakers it will still be the  best investment you make for music and any other sound that comes out of them.  The Bose experts will also tell you that these speakers should not be more than 24 inches apart because they are specifically engineered for you to sit right in front of them. When I heard that I also thought the sound quality would decrease if I stepped away, or perhaps it wouldn't fill a room the way I want.  Not the case. Inches away or across the room, I cannot say enough about this virtual surround sound speaker.  <br /><br />So hopefully that gives you a little more insight into what these speakers can do for you, how they can be used, what I was looking for in particular and what the actual experience was.  If you made it this far, your a trooper.  I hope you found the review useful and if you wanted to contact me with questions we actually sell on the Amazon site.  Just do a search for Epica journal and you can write in. Thanks! - Written over three hours near Los Angeles in the company of Bose Companion 5's.

Virtual 5.1 system with only 3 speakers!  Must hear to believe!
The Bose Companion 5 speaker system is a fantastic addition to a multimedia home computer system.  I've had several different sets of computer speakers, including one other Bose set, and this is hands-down the best set.<br /><br />The Companion 5 set consists of two desktop speakers and an acoustimass-type sub-woofer unit or module.  The module is the heart of the system -- not only does it control the speakers and bass, but it also functions as an excellent soundcard.  The module connects via USB and not through the computer sound card because of that, and will function as the primary soundcard for your computer.  Per the directions, they need to connect through a USB port directly on the computer, and not through a hub or docking station.  The instructions do not specify why, but I presume it would be due to the delay present in most hubs.  Additionally, one needs to make sure that your computers sound and audio settings for the OS and software are configured properly to make sure the speakers work properly.  It should occur automatically when the speakers are set-up.   The directions are all very clear on how to ensure this happens in a step-by-step process, and include a good troubleshooting guide in case problems occur.  It took less than a single minute for me to set up when I did it as almost everything was handled automatically by the speakers.  It is important to note that you must follow the provided directions if you want these speakers to work properly.  Most of the negative reviews posted seem to point out what happens when you don't follow directions.  However, once you follow them, you'll get unbelievable sound from the system.  I had to get up once and check the door behind me because I thought I heard someone knocking, only to discover that it was sound coming from my game that I had heard.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Superb, full spectrum sound from a small, compact system<br />- Very rich sound when used with DVD movies, CD's, MP3's, and games<br />- Accurately conveys 5.1 sound when media/software uses that format<br />- Subwoofer provides excellent very low frequency sounds<br />- Uses very little desk space<br />- Very attractive appearance<br />- Excellent high-end sound card for all but the most specialized applications<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Price (though I don't have "buyer's remorse" now that I have the system, and considering a soundcard is included makes the price more reasonable)<br />- Weakest area of the virtual 5.1 coverage is directly behind head<br />- No microphone input (important for those using online games in particular)<br />- No on-off switch; unit can go into a "mute" or "standby" mode, but seems like a waste of electricity<br />- Will disable/by-pass an expensive sound card if one is on your system<br /><br />OVERALL:  Highly recommended if you can afford it<br />Alternatives:  If one of the problems above is a showstopper for this system, my recommendation would be to look at the Klipsch systems.

Best computer speakers I've ever heard :-)
In the computer store, I had some doubt as to whether these tiny little speakers would have good sound quality.  After all, they are roughly 2 inches tall x 6 inches wide (not counting the woofer), and for many years, I used Boston Acoustic stereo speakers that were roughly 2 feet tall x a foot wide.  I needn't have worried.  I easily hooked these speakers up to my computer and the sound system is awesome!  Far better than those Boston Acoustic speakers that were state of the art in the `80s, and better than the 7 year-old Labtec speakers I've used (which are pretty good.)  I can't detect any distortion in the sound, and it has a 3-D feel to it.  Music sounds fabulous on it.  Highly recommended.<br />

Superior Sound
I have always considered myself a bit of an audiophile.  I appreciate and enjoy quality sound reproduction in both my music and in my movies.  The Bose Companion 5 sound system delivers sound quality well beyond my high expectations for sound.  The price tag is pretty steep, but I decided to go for the surround sound capabilities offered in the Companion 5 system to augment my 30" Apple Cinema Display for an immersive movie-going experience on my Mac.  If connected and set up as per the instructions, this sound system delivers the performance as advertised.<br /><br />Connection is by a simple USB plug.  After that, a quick trip to System Preferences in OS X requires a few set up changes in the sound panel and that is all there is to it.  The first time I played music from iTunes I opened my equalizer and adjusted the settings to my preferences as well as the bass settings knob on the acoustimass sub woofer.  I have owned several sets of speakers including Klipsch and I can easily attest that the Bose Companion 5 is superior to all of them.  The first movie I tried out was "Saving Private Ryan".  From the DVD options menu I selected Dolby 5.1 audio and then I cranked up the volume and watched the Normandy invasion scene.  It was simply incredible.  Several times I was turning and looking behind me because I thought my dog was knocking something over in the room; only to realize that it was the sound of bullets ricocheting behind me.  Awesome.<br /><br />Of all the Bose products I have owned, I have found them all to deliver superior sound as advertised.  If you can get past the sticker shock on these speakers, and make sure that you've adjusted the sound settings on your computer as well as the equalizer settings in your computer's music player and the bass settings knob on the back of the acoustimass sub woofer, I can pretty much guarantee you're going to be in for a very impressive audio experience whether it is music or movies.

Outstanding
I'll preface by admitting I'm not an audiophile since before birth, I don't own a $35,000 CD player with 36x oversampling and error correction provided courtesy of NASA and no, I don't have perfect pitch. However, I do enjoy good music over a good sound system and was blown (completely) by the Bose Lifestyle system (DVD/music storage is moronic but the sound is something made in heaven). For now though and despite the reviews claiming tinniness I decided to buy the Companion 5. I mainly listen to music but I wanted this system instead of the Companion 3 because I wanted to give complete sound control to Bose (these have a built in sound card).<br />The sound is simply outstanding. I'm listening right now to Souad Massi (look her up) and for the sound to be any warmer, closer, immediate she would have to perform right here in my room. Eric Clapton's guitar sounds absolutely real, just fantastic. I toned down the bass a little but otherwise did nothing.<br />I haven't tested the surround effect yet since I don't really watch movies or play games on the computer. For music, I would give this 6 stars if I could. Incidentally - the setup is absolutely trivial. If you are not color blind and lost your sense of touch (either will do), setup takes 30 seconds flat.<br />Here's what I would improve (I'm a techie, we can always improve): since this system basically takes over the sound card, it should have had a mic input. There are good reasons not to use a mic with speakers (echo being the primary) but the choice should be mine. Not having a remote is something that doesn't bother me, but could bother some people. Lastly and common to all systems but a real pet peeve - attaching headphones to the controller unit instantly mutes the speakers. I would much rather have my headphones constantly attached and a switch to control what happens - taking cables in and out all the time breaks connectors. All that said, I can't express how much I'm enjoying the sound coming out of these puppies. And should you care - they also look really great. All the pretentiousness Bose could muster :-)

Amazing
So I just bought it today, and am already impressed.  The sound quality is truly stunning, from such small speakers.  They really do give the im.pression of surround sound. Jazz music becomes vibrant and every note is crystal clear, no distortion. I would highly recomend this system. Was well worth the 400 dollars spent

Almost returned this piece of junk
Just bought the Bose Companion 5, and this is what happened:<br /><br />First, the setup is as easy as Bose wants you to believe.  It took mere minutes, and my i7 Windows 7 Dell Studio XPS had this thing configured very quickly and painlessly.  One thing to remember is that you have to get into the sound setup in the Control Panel to ensure that the Bose is the default system, it does not happen automatically.  The cords provided are long enough to allow for slack and easy hook-up.<br /><br />Second, I gotta say that the aesthetics are fantastic.  This system takes up less room and looks great.  The bass module, however, needs some real estate underneath the desk (not in terms of height or width, but in length, it is 17" long).  The graphite and silver finish is also pleasing in terms of looks and contrast.<br /><br />Third, the integrated volume/input pod is great, easy to use, and unobtrusive.  It allows for easy connection of another source (2 channel), headphones, and when it is tapped on the top automatically goes into mute mode, another tap and it goes live again.<br /><br />Finally, let me tell you about the sound.....it SUCKED!  I couldn't believe it, after spending a premium amount of money and getting a system that sounded tinny and muddy, so tinny that it hurt my ears to listen.<br /><br />I read the manual, look online, and was almost ready to pack them up.  I then tried 1 final thing, I turned the volume control on my computer down to 50%, and then double-checked the bass knob and turned that doen to 50%.  Both were originally maxed out.<br /><br />It solved the problem.  They sounded like they did in the store.  Fantastic treble and tight bass, with a good overlap of midrange from the satellites.<br /><br />Now I show these off to my friends and family and they are blown away.  But this was an accidental discovery.  MAKE SURE THE SOURCE IS AROUND 50%, YOUR ITUNES (or other program) VOLUME IS NOT MAXED OUT, AND YOUR BASS MODULE KNOB IS AT 50%.<br /><br />Finally, your music WILL FREEZE UP if you don't have a pretty recent machine.  I lucked out with my i7 processor-based machine, but you're taking a gamble if your machine is older than 2 years old, in my opinion.<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps!

by far the best computer speakers i've ever used
i've used pretty much every computer speaker system out their from $20 up to $500, and these Bose Companion 5's are by far the best i've ever used.  i was nervous when i spent $400 plus tax on these puppies, but after 3 years, i'm more than satisfied.  not one problem with these speakers.  and they make my 300GB music collection sound great.  you simply can't go wrong with these speakers.  if anyone tells you that their music sounds muddy, etc, its their music, not the speakers.  these speakers are worth every penny i paid for them, and then some.

Wow!
I am a music enthusiast.  I like everything from classical & Jazz to Heavy Metal.  I just hooked up these speakers and I am fully amazed by the sound.  They really couldn't sound any better!  I'm playing some jazz right now and I'm blown away!

Only the best sound system out there
I up graded from a companion 3 to the companion 5 and to me it is equal to the bose 321 home theater system which i own i am a huge fan bose is the best none can match.<br /><br />Clear sound from small speakers fill the room with theater sound like you will never experience.<br /><br />Yes they are expensive but worth it these are speakers that you will own for years to come.<br /><br />And remember NASA only  uses Bose for the sound system on the space shuttle.<br /><br />

Don't Listen to Naysayers!!
I actually bought this system direct from Bose .... and I was not disappointed. Turn off any kind of sound enhancement etc settings on your computer before listening to this system. The sound is AWESOME. And YES just as good as in the Bose store. Music does not sound tinny! Maybe other reviewers aren't properly setting this system up, or did not turn off the computers sound settings/enhancements. The sounds is amazing for music AND movies. worth the $$$ I got it for $359. enjoy :-)))

A Rare Truth in Advertizing -- Big Audio, Small Footprint
I've needed a PC speaker upgrade for years and recently purchased the Bose Companion 5 speaker system at the Bose Outlet store in Palm Springs. It was a factory refurb at $320 versus the typical $400 price.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />* Sound quality -- terrific! Additional details below<br />* Control 'pod' -- elegant and efficient -- a pleasure to use!<br />* Volume control ring (on control pod) -- silent and silky smooth<br />* Appearance -- elegant desktop speakers (small footprint too)<br /><br />Challenges:<br />* Price -- $400 ($320 refub) is serious scratch for PC speakers<br />* Control 'pod': I echo another reviewer -- loose the wire, Bose!<br />* Volume control -- w/b great to have an on-screen volume indicator<br />* Woofer -- surprisingly big cabinet (but easily set out of your way)<br /><br />In my opinion for most folks no show-stoppers here except possibly price.<br /><br />Sound quality: Chrystal clear, great range and consistently good quality even at impressive volumes. Canveat: While I stand by my position on sound quality I defer to more authoritive positions for details.<br /><br />Although I can crank it up and my wife in the next room easily hears and enjoys the sound quality of this system don't expect any desk-top system to replace something designed for a full room. No matter how clever you get via the electonics in the end ANY small speakers have limitations.<br /><br />Factory Refurb: By all indicators (performance, cleanliness, et al) my system was in perfect condition. There was no indication -- including all the myiad packaging for all components in the box --  that this was anything other than a brand-new, Bose factory-direct product.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm simply thrilled with this speaker system!

So much beauty out of such a tiny little package
Most of my listening now is done via my computer.  I was really missing high fidelity but I don't have to now.  Bose has done an amazing job on this compact stereo system.  very impressed with the quality and resolution of sound these tiny speakers put out. The set's easily installed, connnects via a USB cable, which means you can put the set a bit further from your computer if you want to have some distance from your music.  Very pleased with Bose's Companion 5 speakers and grateful to have my music back.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, July 2009

Worth every penny
The sound is perfect, awesome and very loud -- if you like it loud -- but if you just like great sound, the best sound, at any volume, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />It seems really expensive, until you plug it in an listen to it.  Then, it is worth every penny.<br /><br />

Excellent Speakers!
These speakers are expensive, but the sound quality is indeed exceptional and makes them worthwhile in my opinion.  The 5 series speakers can put out a tremendous amount of sound, I currently have them set at about 8% volume, and turn them up to about 20% of their capacity if I want to hear them throughout my entire apartment.  Highly satisfied with Bose sound quality.  As an additional note, I bought the Bose Companion 3's and they are OK for a small room, have excellent style and very form factor, but put out just over 1/3 the breadth of sound as the Companion 5's.  My suggestion would be to skip the 3's and go with the 5's.

Simply The Best
I have had the Companion 3 Series II for a year now, and was very pleased.  After giving them to a friend that helped me with a project because she wouldn't take money, I decided to treat myself and upgrade to the Companion 5.  I have a 24" iMac, but I do not watch movies on it nor do I play computer games.  I do however listen to a wide variety of music on it all the time, and am more than happy with my purchase!<br /><br />The sound quality is noticeably different that the 3 Series, and I loved those speakers.  It has a fuller, more spacious feeling, that fills the area with a clean, vibrant sound.  I haven't heard anything behind me like some reviewers report, but I can hear the left/right channel separation a lot better on these than I did on the Companion 3.  I am a musician as well, and can't wait to see how my own music sounds on them.<br /><br />If you do not listen to music all the time, it's not worth the price tag compared to the Companion 3, but if you do, and or you want to treat yourself, you will not be disappointed.  I was disappointed with my Bose Wave radio, but these speakers are simply the best when it comes to listening to music on your computer!

Bosed with Love
There are special and well-made products that can invoke a feeling of deep love in a man's heart and brain because of their quality and performance.   My ears and heart loves the sound of Bose speakers.   However, other people may prefer the sound quality of iPod Speakers:  Logitech, Altec Lansing inMotion iM600, Chestnut Hill Sound George, JBL Onstage Micro, Logitech iGroove HG & Pure-Fi Elite, Klipsch iGroove & Roomgroove, Bowers&Wilkins Zeppelin or iPod mStation Orb 2.1.  There are maybe less expensive and better speakers; again, my personal preference is Bose.  Well after ten years of good sound from my Boston Acoustic PC Speakers, they slowly faded and eventually ceased to play.  It is now time for an upgrade (actually, I wanted a Quantum Leap) in PC speakers.  Because I own the Bose--401 Direct/Reflecting with Stereo Space Array, 151 Environment and SoundDock Portable Digital iPod Speakers (I have been Bosed with Love 4X--going back twenty years), the only three choices were the Bose Companion 2 & 3 Series II Multimedia Speakers or Companion 5 Multimedia Speakers.   Therefore, I took a slow Sunday drive with my iPod to the Newark, Delaware (The Sales-Tax-Free State) Bose Store to compare all three speakers (Amazon.com may offer free shipment).  The Bose female sales representative was knowledgeable and accommodating as I went back and forth between the three speakers to determine which one was going home with me.  I played a wide arrange of music to hear how the speakers performed with different genres of music--for example, Duke Ellington, Philadelphia Orchestra, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bob Marley, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, Steve Ray Vaughan, Santana, Dave Matthew and Sade.  (Music is one the greatest of all times creation by humans.)  Good music coming out of Bose Speakers can prevent visits to a $300 hourly psychologist.  The superior sound of good music coming out of Bose Speakers could be an investment in your stable mental health.  The Companion 2 was removed from the list early because their sound quality was not rich and dynamic.  They are nice little speakers but I needed more sound range and power.  Therefore, it was narrowed down to the Companion 3 and 5.  In addition to sound quality, money became a variable in the decision making process between the two speakers. Just as in the sound quality, the price was substantially different.  Yes, Bose can be considered somewhat expensive but I was willing to pay my extra hard-earned dollars for their good customer service, high quality and durable products.  Actually, it is expensive when you purchase products for a cheaper price, which is not good quality, because you will most likely replace it again--and again---and end up paying the price for the Bose (or another excellent product) you always wanted. For that reason--there are times in life, if one can afford it, that you pay the extra money for significantly better products.  Such was the case in deciding to purchase the Companion 5.  The clarity, dynamic, richness, and surround sound was worth every hard-earned dollar. The Bose Companion 5 Multimedia Speakers were the Quantum Leap in sound quality I wanted in a new pair of PC Speakers.  I paid the price, walked hastily to my SUV, drove quickly back to Philly, removed my shoes, elevated into a altered-state-of-mind with the help of some Ginseng-Tea and K-Herb, attached my iPod to the computer and selected various Playlists--at half volume, music could be heard in all four rooms on the second floor.   Oh Yesssss, I am in Love with them Boses!    <br /><br />

Sinply the 'best' in the world!
Have you ever heard the expression "you get what you pay for"   ???       Truer words were never spoken with this Bose Speaker system. This is the closest thing to perfect sound I have ever heard. As far as I am concerned, this is the standard for perfect. At $400 you have the 'State of the art ' system. I am a real quality sound buff, I can't enjoy songs unless the sound is premium... UTOPIA AT LAST!!!   If you have a media computer and Rhapsody or Napster, this system is a must. It truely has the sound of most $700-$900 5 to 7 speaker Surround sound systems for your TV....and this comes from a computer!  A media room MUST!!!   Simply the best in the world and worth every cent!

Worth the price
The sound quality was even better than I expected. At first I felt guilty making such a large investment for speakers,, however I did not have to invest in an audio card which did reduce the over all cost. I recomend this product to anyone that feels they deserve the best,<br /><br />

Perfect for Classical Music!
I have been looking for a decent pair of speakers for my computer for almost a year. After going through many user reviews, as well as actually listening to some of them, I have to say the Soundsticks are one of the best computer speaker sets out there. You will be surprised that plastic speakers can sound this great! I have had the Soundsticks speaker for close to a month already. As with many others, I am very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />I primarily use Soundsticks to listen to classical music, which I believe is very demanding towards speakers. Due to the very dynamic nature of classical music, speakers need to perform well all the way from the highs to the lows in order to give a reasonable interpretation to the music. Because a lot of the speakers on the market now are geared towards the R&B / Rockn'Roll / Rap crowd, many of them only have some bass to shake the floor. Their inadequacy in reproducing the intricate details in classical music is indeed painfully obvious.<br /><br />On the contrary, Soundsticks give a balanced performance across the spectrum, providing classical music fans the perfect solution to computer music. The highs are sweet and clear. If you try to play the "Voice of an Angel" album from Charlotte Church on Soundsticks, you will see what I mean. Midrange is a little bit on the tight side, probably because the tweezers aren't equipped very well to handle that. Nevertheless, Soundsticks still show considerable warmth and refinement. Bass is solid with good definition. The subwoofer won't shake the floor like other systems. What Soundsticks give you is quality bass, not quantity. Overall, the sound is very spacious and rich. You can try the Tchaikovsky piano concerto no. 1 on Soundsticks. The grand poetic opening of the piece will give you a very good idea what Soundsticks can do for you.<br /><br />Of course, nothing is perfect. Soundsticks do have shortcomings:<br />1.	Lacks a little bit of midrange.<br />2.	Sound is very directional. Once you move away from the "sweet spot", the spaciousness of the sound disappears.<br />3.	Bass adjusting knob is on the subwoofer unit, kinda hard to reach if you put the subwoofer under your desk.<br />4.	Touch sensitive control will take some time to get used to.<br />5.	Soundsticks cannot be turned off unless you unplug them. So, they are not very friendly to your electricity bill.<br />6.	Relatively pricey.<br /><br />However, I guess all the shortcomings mentioned is relatively trivial compared to the wonderful sound they produce.<br /><br />I highly recommend Soundsticks to all classical music fans. You will get the biggest bang of your buck investing on Soundsticks! They will perfectly fill up your office / bedroom / dorm room and give you the most intimate experience with your favorite music ever! Amazon has been offering the Soundsticks at the lowest price on the internet as far as I know. For the record, I brought mine for $120.<br /><br />One last point I want to draw your attention to is the pitfall of connecting the Soundsticks to computer. You may hear a good deal of statics noise in doing so, even when you are not playing any music. Chances are that it is the fault of your bad computer soundcard. You can verify this by connecting the Soundsticks to a CD player, preferably those with a dedicated optical lineout. If you don't get statics anymore after that, then it is definitely your computer's fault!<br /><br />You may also want to check out the Bose Companion 3 speaker set. The Companion sounds at least as good as Soundsticks if not better. However, they cost twice as much as Soundsticks. And of course, they don't look quite as good! Is this a trade off you are willing to make? You will have to decide on your own.<br /><br />Some good recordings to try on the Soundsticks:<br />Dvorak Cello Concerto in B Minor, Op.104 (Rostropovich)<br />Bruch Scottish Fantasy (Perlman)<br />Tchaikovsky: Concerto No. 1/Rachmaninoff: Concerto No. 2 (Van Cliburn)<br />Voice of an Angel (Charlotte Church)<br />Classics (Sarah Brightman)<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Happy listening to all the intellectually sophisticated classical music fans!!

Astounding design, improved electronics
Many of the opinions of the original Soundsticks apply to these Soundsticks 2--incredible design, good sound, and so on, but these second generation speakers are better in several respects:<p>Harman/Kardon abandoned the awkward, limiting USB interface of the original model. The Soundsticks 2 use an almost universal connector, the stereo mini-plug, used in almost all computers and portable stereo equipment--CD players and the like.  I use mine with my iPod and it's a dynamite combination.<p>The volume control consists of two touch-sensitive pads on one of the sticks. Touch both simultaneously, and it mutes.  Very cool.  They kept the blue LED in the subwoofer which glows beautifully in a darkened room.<p>Bass from the subwoofer is more than adequate, in my opinion, and overall sound is quite good.  Setup is incredibly simple.<p>But most of all, the cool-ness factor of these speakers, especially the subwoofer, is worth the price of admission.  You won't want to hide this one under a desk.  Everyone stops in their tracks when they see this speaker system.  Highly recommended.

Amazing Soundsticks!
I recently bought the Soundsticks 2 from Amazon. I have been a music teacher for more years than I care to think about and good quality sound is really important to me.<br />I have a great Hi Fi system at home in the living room and our family computer is in the kitchen. I've connected the Harman Kardons to the computer and to say the least, I'm over the moon with their performance. I listen to all types of music and these speakers produce the goods. This evening I have listened to Joe Cocker, Herbie Hancock, Gustav Holst, Samuel Barber, Vivaldi and Stevie Wonder! In every instance the speakers produced clean, well balanced music. Plenty of volume and amazing sound quality and stereo image. I spent a little time in iTunes when I first got the speakers and adjusted the equalizer to my tastes. The bass is full without being boomy, the highs nice and clean and the voices come through beautifully. I find myself sitting in front of the computer listening to music more than I do in the living room with my expensive sound system! For the price these speakers are hard if not impossible to beat. They may not be what you want if you want earth shattering rumble to accompany video games but if you want to hear great music on a set of remarkable speakers, you won't be disappointed with the Harman Kardon Soundsticks. By the way, I have never written a review of any product before this one. When listening to them tonight I just had to get on line and spread the word.

Now I view my computer as a music system--awesome product
I've seen pictures of these speakers at the Appple web site and I thought Apple Compputer chose them because of the clear plastic modern look.  Wrong.<br /><br />These speakers are the best computer speakers I've heard or seen.  I tried them out at Comp USA and had trouble leaving the store.  <br /><br />Amazon's prices are far better, with reliable shipping, so I plan to buy some here.  Don't take my word for it, but do make a special trip out just to hear these speakers playing your favorite mpeg music--you will be hooked.  Bring a CD full of your favortie mpegs.  If you don't use your computer for mpegs, then start today.<br /><br />There are two vertical mini-speaker columns.  Each has four tweaters.  Close inspection reveals there is a tuned port in the base of each for more mid range--hence the reason the tweaters are stacked in a column.  <br /><br />The right speaker has a capacitive touch switch which I didn't notice at first.  I moved the speakers around trying to figure out why the volume was so low, and suddenly the sound got louder.  Then I figured out the switch--which is faster and easier to adjust volume than the computer controls.  Very cool, and better--useful and handy.<br /><br />The subwoofer is shaped like a hollow apple, with the cone facing downwards and a tuned port opening to the top.  It is not as big as many subwoofers but delivered great sound.<br /><br />All three of these would fit in a bookbag making them a nice portable system.<br /><br />The sound of these speakers was awesome for such a small package.  It is not often that I experience a product like this and immediately want it.  <br /><br />I'm a cautious purchaser.  But now I'm hooked.  I see myself buying not just one set, but several for myself.  I've decided to buy these for Christmas gifts this year.  <br /><br />Finally, I can't wait to try these with an iPod. If an iPod mount was built into the woofer, this would be a perfect setup.

It does turn off.
Everyone mentions that the product does not turn off. If you put your finter over the + & - volume buttons at the same time the speakers will cut off. This allows you to unplug your ipod without distortion.

Sexiest Speakers Ever!
I bought these for my Sony Vaio at Costco for $119.  They had them hooked up and the sound was pretty good even in the cavernous concrete of Costco.  But lets face it I was sold as much by the sound quality as the obvious physical charms.<br /><br />Stroking the base of of one of these very responsive adjustable angle sticks makes the volume go up or down.  They take up very little room on my cluttered desk and always seem - er - happy to see me.  Very cheering to a working gal.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of classical music over the net while I work (KVOD broadcasts out of Colorado - great station).  The sound sticks are a delight to listen to and there is no comparison over my old PC speakers.  I also listen to a lot of Folk (WUMB) and they sound great for that too.  I'm not a Heavy Metal fan and don't really need a bass that will rattle my fillings.<br /><br />Want a sweet sounding sexy companion for your laptop?  Look no further. ;)

Not Dissapointed
I bought this speaker system strictly on looks and reviews. I am a very careful researcher usually, but I knew that I had to have these as soon as I saw them. Luckily for me, the sound is AWSOME. Much better than I had hoped for. I have an Emac, and these not only look great with it, but I am going to sell my stereo and use the computer as my music system now. Trust me, these are all you are going to need to fill your apartment or room with great sound. Especially for us New Yorkers with shoebox apartments and nice computers, you won't be sorry!

All-around great speaker system!
I purchased this speaker system Summer of 2004 from J&R to use in my college dorm room. I have to say, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made. It is one of the best sounding systems in the dorm, and the little subwoofer can really shake a room! I continually get positive comments from friends about both its looks and its sound. I recommend this system highly!

Very good speakers for the money
Let me preface this by saying I am extremely picky about music, and have about 20k of very carefully selected audio gear :)<br /><br />These speakers will not satisfy the audiophile, but they are without a doubt the best multimedia speakers I've ever heard.  Crisp highs, thick and tight lows, however the mids are slightly under-represented, but thats to be expected due to the small size of the diaphrams.  The stereo image is a bit strange as well, its not bad, but does take some getting used to.<br /><br />Also, these speakers are *extremely* directional, when setup correctly they basically sound good in one spot.  Even tilting the speakers slightly makes a huge difference in the sound.  The problem with the mids can be minimized to a very acceptable level by placing the speakers correctly.  This is an advantadge to me personally as  I use them in my office and the sound doesn't carry as much as a set of bookshelf speakers.  These speakers also sound better at mid to high volumes then lower ones.<br /><br />Overall -- I'm of the opinion that if speakers sound bad, it doesn't matter how cool they look.  However, when somethign looks good and functions well, its just that much better.  <br /><br />One last note == these speakers are good enough to make low bitrate MP3s sound like the four letter word they are.  If you're investing in a decent pair of speakers, you should consdier encoding your music to a high bitrate MP3 or medium to high bitrate Ogg (of course you paid for your music, so you can do that...right? hah)

Soundsticks WOW!
As a huge fan of music i was tired of my tinny laptop speaker, and tired of giant recievers taking up all of my desk space.  So i ventured to the store to see what i could do about my dillema.  I looked at the JBL creature speakers first. with the sub the sounded ok, but without it the sounded horrible. I came to the Harmon Kardan brand speakers, and was impressed. The highs were clear and concise and the low were great so i purchased them.  I hooked them up in minutes witht he satellite speakrs on my desk about 3 feet apart angled towards me, and the sub on the floor out of sight. First song i played was counting crows friend of the devil a grateful dead cover, and i was blown away. The vocals were so clear and the when the bass hit i smiled, i love a good bass response. After that i threw in some 2pac, the opposite end of the spectrum. The music flowed in to my ears, crisp, clean, and sharp, with no muddy bass sound. After That i decided to go with Alison Krauss, i played "Down to the River to Pray" a  vocal track and couldnt believe my ears. So beautiful.<br />Overall i love these speakers. Great Looking, better sounding, and at $169, not too pricey. GET THESE, youll love em.

Amazing Sound, Amazing Value
Subsequent to reading about 200 reviews on Harman Kardon's Sounstciks II, one of which was written by a consumate audiophile who found this system hard to fault, I ordered my first set from E-bay but which I returned because they were not cosmetically as advertised ("perfect").<br /><br />I then ordered a second set from Amazon which sounded sublime--for five minutes before my<br />room was as silent as a tomb.<br /><br />No sweat. If a GPS system can cage over the North Atlantic on a fresh-from-the-factory $250,000,000 Boeing 777, I can't really expect Harman Karmon to flawlessly crank out tens of thousands of these things for less than $200 without one or two having a glitch.<br /><br />But it gets better. <br /><br />Less than five minutes after I had the unit unplugged Amazon had fired me off a "mea culpa" assuring me I would be sent a new set and that I would have it before I could box up and send back the defective one--and they did.<br /><br />When the unit arrived I was sure to follow the extremely simple sound-systems-for-dummies set-up instructions. The moment of truth was here--again-- but when I cranked these exquisitely designed speakers up, my room was filled with the sound that would make angels weep, assuming there are angels, they can hear music, and they are capable of weeping.<br /><br />I'm not an audiophile. I have been told that I have a very primitive, binary nervous system: I sense either pleasure or pain with nothing in the middle. I do not know what the "middle range" is for sounds produced by speakers or what would be a sufficient level of base produced by a subwoofer to justify an investment of about U.S. $120.00. I do know that when I listen to the astonishing Cherubini's "Requiem", I can feel the "searing heat" of the piece in a way I never did before from speakers that cost 10 times as much. I marvel at how <br />such an inexpensive peripheral could make me understand why Berlioz said that the final moments of Cherubini's masterpiece, ""surpasses anything of the kind that has been written".<br /><br />All this for less than a really good pair of shoes?<br /><br />I've heard the criticisms of insufficient volume and bass and, frankly, I don't get it. My guess is that such knitpicking comes from those who you see in bumper-to-bumper traffic tapping on their steering wheels while the base from their car radios makes you feel as though, even with the  windows closed,  your ribs are exploding in your chest.<br /><br />I've also heard both vague and specific references to the absence of "middle tones" and "sonic whallop" produced by these speakers and find such criticism baseless, pardon the pun.<br /><br />No matter what your taste, no matter whether you prefer Mahler to Mick Jagger or Rod Stewart to Rossini, Harman Kardon, by way of Amazon, gives you a terrific bang for your buck with Soundsticks II.<br /><br />And for an added bonus, the super-slick, space-saving design with it's ethereal blue-lighted subwoofer is a can't-miss icebreaker.<br /><br />Add it all up--the price, the sound, and Amazon's warp speed customer service if things go wrong--and one word describes it all: intoxicating.

Spectacular!!
Very easy to set up, works great, and looks beautiful.  It sounds perfect, not off in the slightest.  As far as the power, it's loud enough for a very loud listening level, and loud enough to fill a floor for a casual party, but not loud enough for a dance party or to fill the entire house.  The bass is actually overpowered if you turn it all the way up.  I keep it at the mid-point and it's just right.  You don't need 5.1 for MP3's and virtually all CD's, because they're not in 5.1.  BTW the two towers have a rubbery base which prevents them from slipping.  The subwoofer cylinder has a bluish light that makes it look sci-fi.  Put it under the table just like the manual says.<br /><br />The one slight criticism I would make is that there's no way to quickly turn down the volume on the speakers themselves.  However, what I do is to keep the speakers close to the max, and then to use Apple's Frontrow remote (or the keyboard) to adjust the system volume.  You can quickly go from zero to max and back and again that way with a couple of pushes of the up or down button on the remote or on the keyboard.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable.  I can't think of a speaker system for my computer that I would prefer to this one in terms of sound quality or appearance, and so if you're going to spend $1,500 for a computer, spending 10% of that or $150 for superior speakers is well worth it!

Harman Soundsticks
There was nothing truly wrong with my previous pair of Boston Acoustic speakers, they were just about 8 years old and I was looking for something that took up less space. I have always had my eye on the Soundsticks, and like the majority of the other reviewers...these do not disappoint. The subwoofer is big, but as they recommend, it's on the floor under my desk, so I freed up a a nice bit of space not having a subwoofer and two speakers on my desktop. They have a clean, simple design. The volume buttons, located at the bottom of the front of one of the sticks, were hard to find, as they are so small they are barely visible...not a problem, just a fact. They are very sensitive and it takes almost no pressure to adjust.  The sound is rich and complex with great bass...I hear new things in the music I've been listing to for years. All and all, a great speaker system for a great price.

Sound with Style
These are excellent desktop speakers and would recommend them to anyone looking for great sound and style!  I've purchased to sets of them.  One for my home office and another set for the family computer. My only complaint would the the constant blue glow the sub-woofer gives off.  Its cool, but I wish it where an option that could be turned off.  It reminds me of the glow of the undercarriage of a "pimped out ride" that I would pull up next to and roll my eyes at....

Put a little MOMA on your desktop...
Harman Kardon came out with the first version of the iSub back in 1999.  The iSub paired nicely with our Apple's Pro Speakers and Cinema Display.<br /><br />In 2000, they came out with a set of matching satellite speakers called Sound Sticks. The Sound Sticks connected via USB making them "computers only". They also had no physical volume controls...the sound had to be adjusted via software.<br /><br />After listening to feedback from their customers, Harmon Kardon released an updated version called Sound Sticks II.<br /><br />It is always great to see high end companies design products for the other end of the market.  They bring all of their experience, design capabilities, and quality with them when they move down market.  This brings the level up for everybody... product makers and end users!<br /><br />The Harman Kardon usability folks gave a lot of thought into making the product easy to set up. The designers and engineers clearly had a great time creating this product!<br /><br />[...]

Awesome output
I bought the Harman Kardon Soundsticks after a lot of market survey. I listen to a lot of heavy metal and heavier stuff and I needed speakers that could handle the frequencies without jarring at high volume. I had Bose in mind and then tried out the Harman Kardon soundsticks. They rock! And the best part is that they are cheaper than Bose speakers. The look is cool and the air column subwoofer is just mindboggling! The blue light in the subwoofer gives a neat look to the transparent case. 5 stars to Harman Kardon!

Most awesome and LEGEN.... wait for it ... DARY speakers
The Harman/Kardon SountSticks It is great in every way - from physical appearance to to clear, crispy sound. They provide a full sound range - from the lows to the mids and the highs. Every song I tested it with contains the majority of the details I would hear when listening through in-ear earphones. The sound of instrumental music sounds fantastic with these speakers. The sound of acoustic guitar is very clear - as clear as the speakers itself. <br /><br />Its appearance is very attractive. I even wanted to attach it to the ceiling as my room light bulb. The blue light in the speakers looks holographic and gives the speakers its uniqueness. I wish that Harman Kardon could attach those blue LED light bulbs on those satellites. It would look really awesome with them. <br /><br />As a precaution to future buyers: If you live in a multi-floor apartment or have neighbors, I would recommend doing some homework on sound-absorption materials. The subwoofer produces very strong bass that I could even hear it from inside my bathroom about 40 feet away! My neighbor has complained to me very often that she could not sleep because of them. I had to find ways to absorb some of the bass before they reached the first level. Aside from that, this speaker is the one I would recommend to people who love to listen to music, play games, or watch movies from their computer or their home theater system.<br /><br />There's no consumer speakers that would sound as great as this at this price. It's worth each and every single penny you pay.

better than expected
I did quite a bit of research before buying this speaker system.  I am more than pleased with the quality.  A lot of negative reviews mention that there is no on/off button, but THERE IS! It never ceases to amaze me how people complain about such things and aren't even right.  The on/off button is on the sub, and it also functions as the volume switch for the sub.  You can either turn the knob to turn the sub up or down, and you can push the knob in to turn the speakers off.  If the light bothers you, turn them off!<br /><br />All that to say, though, that the quality of the sound is excellent.  I am hearing layers in my music that I hadn't before heard.  And the system gets plenty loud to fill my large room with sound.  I give this product 5 out of 5 stars because not only does it produce wonderful, warm sound, but also, they have incredibly attractive looks!  If you're not sure whether or not to get these (which is exactly how I was), I would highly recommend that you get them!

Fast Memory but the need could be questionable .
Most Digital SLR's including those below 1000.00 dollars have an integrated buffer system that allows for minimum 3 shots per second.  Because of this, the photos are not directly being written to the card immediately and this type of card is not needed.  If you are shooting in burst mode - (As many shots continuously), then this card makes sense.  Think of it as pouring water into a pitcher that has a hole in the bottom.  if you fill the water faster than the water leaving the pitcher, you will need this card.  It allow's the buffer memory to transfer more quickly to the card.<br /><br />If you have a digital SLR and taking a shot every minute or so, you don't need this card.  Go for an inexpensive SD card with more memory.  It would be fine.<br /><br /> I would also recommend the Extreme card to someone who has a point and shoot camera since there is next to no buffer memory that transfer's the photo data to the card and the camera is more dependent on the write speed of the card.<br />

Speed, Speed, Speed
If you are buying a several hundred dollar camera, then at least have the sense to take advantage of it by buying a FAST memory card.  I didn't expect much from this card, or for there to be a noticable difference.  Well, was I shocked from my recent vacation when I was shooting photos left and right, and the people in my group were waiting 2-3 seconds before the could take another photo.  Not only does it allow your camera to shoot faster, but it lowers your blood pressure as well, because you didn't miss the shot.  I can never go back to using a regular speed card.  The card worked as advertised.  I love it.

Great Card: Overkill For Casual Users
Someone else said it well in a previous review: this might be more than you need. Unless you are a sports photographer or normally shoot tons of photos in continuous mode, the 2 GB Extreme III actually has more speed than you need. The 2 GB Ultra II card <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065ANYC">SanDisk SDSDH-2048-901 2 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card (Retail Package)</a> has plenty of speed for most photographers (about 98% of the shooters out there).  I own both, and they both work well. <br /><br />That said, the 2 GB Extreme III is extremely fast in my D40; 20-25 large/normal JPEG shots in continuous mode write to this card almost instantaneously, with perhaps a 0.5 second lag at the end. RAW or RAW + JPEG continuous shots would write a tad slower, but still amazing.  Read/transfer speeds are similarly swift.  <br /><br />SanDisk memory cards are very reliable, and well-priced.  You can't go wrong with this product, you might just want to order the Ultra II to save a few bucks.  You could also make due with the 1GB Ultra II card <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065AO0K">SanDisk SDSDH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card (Retail Package)</a> if you are a casual shooter with a 4-6 megapixel camera.  Whatever you get, make sure you have at least two of them, so you won't run out of memory and have a back-up in case of failure.<br /><br />Almost forgot to mention:  the Extreme III card retail package comes with the latest version of Sandisk's "RescuePRO File Recovery Utility" (v3.2) on a mini CD, plus a small memory card carrying pouch.  Nice extras, included in the price. <br /><br /> [UPDATE 8/26/07:  Just checked the prices on both cards.  With a one-dollar 34-cents difference, you might as well get the Extreme III.  Right now Amazon has the best price out there...]

Built for Real-World Conditions
I really like this card. It's made well for professionals in real-world conditions. The package comes with a free neoprene carrying pouch, a plastic hard case, literature, and a cd-rom for the recovery & back-up software programs. <br /><br />As far as speed, I'm not sure how fast it is, but I'd say it's equal to another brand of 2GB SD card that's rated at 150x speed. Of course, your camera's processing speed also factors in.<br /><br />In my 10 MP Panasonic DMC-FZ50 camera, the SanDisk 2GB Extreme III SD card gives me exactly 399 shots. This gets interesting: my Leica M8 gets exactly 539 shots at the finest jpeg setting!  <br /><br />So far, I have not had any data loss problems, and that to me is very important.

FAST and reliable!
You get what you pay applies when it comes to secure digital SanDisk memory cards. You can pay less, but if your using the card for photography you could loose a shot if you're using a standard(speed) sd card with a high(10 megapixel)digital camera. So the combination of speed and reliability, SanDisk stands behind their product with a lifetime guarantee, is well worth the slight premium you'll pay. Think about it like this, back in the day when we would pay a premium for our favorite film, over and over and... Well with this card(film)you pay once and it keeps giving.

A big difference for me!
I bought this accidently while on vacation, thinking it was another ultra card. For me, there was a big difference between this and an ultra. My camera is a Canon S2IS. There is a very noticeable difference using this card, and I can get a lot more pictures off in less amount of time than with an ultra card. Is it worth the price difference? For me, it is. I hate to miss a nice picture of my kids doing something because the camera is not "ready," so, for the extra bit of money, I am very happy. Also, I would like to note that downloading the pictures and vvideo to my laptop, was also much faster, another pleasant surprise after taking several hundred pictures. The card reader in my laptop (which is almost 3 years old) reads the card with no problem. Lastly,the idea of safely getting back deleted pictures is nothing new, and software can easily be found (for free), with little effort, to get back whatever you accidently deleted (just don't write over the card, as you may not be able to get it back then). I know some people said they did not notice a big difference with their setup, but the few reviews I read did not say what their setup was, and I have to wonder how full the card was. I think that as the card gets more full, you will see a bigger difference. I will only buy these cards (unless faster ones come out that will work on my camera) from now on......oh yes, and a quick search will find the 2gig card for around $35 with free shipping elsewhere.<br /><br />update: I just bought two more from Amazon. The price is awesome, and they are great!

An Extraordinary Memory Card
I replaced my Sandisk SD card with this and really noticed the difference. No stalling or stopping when taking movies. A great card. I use it in my Canon S3 and wouldn't use anything else. Highly recommended.

From a digital photographer's thoughts:
Excellent card.<br />Recommendation: A+<br />Pros: Large, secure, and fast<br />Cons: You pay for the large, secure, and the fast!<br /><br />Opinion: Ok, here's the deal. I bought two of them when a bought my canon s3, because for a heavy duty camera like that, you can't bother with cheap, slow, "ecconomical" trash. I found these cards to be everything as described (there was one note, not really a problem. Just remember that ALL cards are set at an estimated value. What i mean is that this card is rated a 2gb, but is actually 1.8gb. All cards are like this, but just take note). If you are willing to pay, you will be satisfied.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you can justify the price, buy it!

Amazing speed!
Got this for my 10 megapixel Canon G7. The difference from a regular SD card was much more than I'd hoped.  20 MB/sec. min. read-write speed is amazing.  This card's speed allows the G7 to unleash its Digic III processor, and will snap off continuous shots(finest setting,no flash or cont. AF) until the memory is full with absolutely no lag...approx. 3-4 shots/sec.  Regular card stopped to write after 6 shots.  Play back time is now almost instant and shutter lag has all but disappeared.  If you've been considering a G7, it is a better camera than most reviews say it is, despite its limitations (no RAW, etc.)  I suspect some of the reviews would have been much better if they had used a card as fast as the Sandisk Extreme III. As a bonus, you get a licenced disk of RescuePRO in the box to retrieve erased data from media. Worth the extra money.

What can you say about memory cards? It works.
I have three of these cards and use them with my Nikon dSLR and have had no problems. The Extreme III's do seem to write a little faster (i.e., I notice some difference) than the Extreme II cards in my dSLR, but I notice no real difference with my Casio point-and-shoot. I would certainly recommend the card for "extreme" applications-- how's that for a titular reference?

Great, reliable card!
I shoot RAW with a Panasonic 8 MP DMC-FZ30 camera.  This card works great!  I haven't used anything else, so I can't compare it's performance.  I have 3 Extreme III cards.  In the process of purchasing these 3 "good" cards I also inadvertently purchased 3 fake cards.  If you know what your looking for, it's easy to spot a fake. The printing is different, the card-board is thinner, it's missing any sealing, the inner packaging is not sealed... Here is a great web site on spotting fakes. [...]

The Best SD card!
I have a 10 megapixel camera, so it can take a while to store all that information and I have had no problems, even when shooting in cont. mode.  I bought an 8 gig card from another manuf., claiming to be the new SD-HD card (which is slightly thicker).  My camera says its an 8 GB, but whoa, is it slow in comparison to my SanDisk.  Hey, I knew if it's too good to be true (price wise), then it is too good to be true - but I bought it anyways - shoulda just bought me another Extreme III.

Gotta have it
If you are using a digital camera, you gotta have it. The Extreme series memory cards are FAST! If you had to wait for your camera to process your picture it could very well be your card! <br />  No more waiting for the card with the Extreme series memory cards!<br /><br /> I have a Cannon SD850 and the D30.

Works flawlessly with Canon SD800 IS
I bought a 1GB regular speed card to use with my camera (Canon SD800). The video with the regular card was a little choppy, and deleting images off the camera took over a second sometimes. This memory card is lightning fast. Best of all, because it's so fast, it helps conserve battery life.

Superfast and very secure!
The card cannot be read in some readers IF yours is old. One of my computers was from Gateway in 2004-5 and could not read it  but the other card readers could read it or you can just buy a cheap USB 2.0 reader to hook it to the USB port.<br /><br />What else can I say? Nothing, really. Before, I used to take my external HDD of palm pilot size that also stores the files from the card directly using its built-in reader. But now, I can go out without worrying about running out of the memory. And, I use 7.1m pixel camera for still/movie shots. Downloading is super fast. And, I am glad that I chose "Ultra" SD. <br />

Excellent price.  Amazing bargain
Great bargain and great price.  Works great for use in a digital camera (mine Canon S5) although not sure if it makes a difference that it is the super fast version.  Might be a little more muscle than I need but at $35 who cares.

Just work as it's supposed to
I'm using this with my D80, and with a Toshiba laptop that has a built in Secure Digital port on the side.  I don't take a lot of photos at the max rates with my camera so the fast memory doesn't really make that much difference when taking photos, but the speed does make a big difference when downloading from the memory card to the laptop.

SanDisk Extreme III SD
I have been a cusomer of SanDisk memory cards for 10+ years starting with CF cards from introduction up to the last generation Extreme II CF cards.  Bought both Extreme III SD cards to go with my Nikon d40x 10 mp dslr.  Extreme III is rated by SanDisk to perform roughly twice as fast as Extreme II and they deliver!  I've rotated my two cards in the month of near every other day shooting and have had excellent performance.  In-camera processing is less than a second or two and passes unnoticed by me even when shooting wildlife in bursts of five or more 10 megapixel images (haven't gone beyond that as yet).  The other end of digital work is when transferring images to your computer (I have an iMac).  The speed of operation is elegant and efficient.  Haven't had trouble with a SanDisk product in a decade and continue to be pleased with their products.

Fast Fast Fast!
Do you hear that, its the sound of my Nikon D80 furiously clicking away.  There was a very noticeable difference when I changed my first 2GB SD for this one.<br /><br />The buffer on the camera clears much faster and my shots per second have finally matched what the Specs say they should be.<br /><br />My only minor complaint was the amount of packaging they send you for this tiny little card, I mean do we really need the cloth carrying case?!

This could be the right card for you.
With fast shooting high mega pixel cameras, the CF card can be a major performance factor. Why have one of these cameras and use a card that cannot keep up? When prices started dropping on CF cards, I decided it was time to get yet another one.<br /><br />The Extreme III cards write with a 20 MB/sec sequential read/write speed. These fast write speeds are desirable with large image files. There are cameras with buffers to hold images while writing to the card during continuous shots. At some point if the card cannot write fast enough, your camera will stop shooting until the buffer clears enough room.<br /><br />This card has a high impact rating. For example; if you were to accidentally drop this card 10-foot up to then hit the floor, this card is rated to sustain the fall without damage.<br /><br />Also consider this card can withstand temperatures from -13 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit (as indicated on the package).  Since I live in Texas, I doubt I'll ever have a problem with the card getting too cold.  It is nice to know that I could possibly leave the card in a car under the hot Texas sun and it may still work.  I've yet to test this scenario, and its unlikely I ever will.<br /><br />Sometimes the trade off on price comes from power consumption. Lower priced cards may use more power to do the same job as this card. The low power consumption of this card means a longer battery life. <br /><br />People generally want to know how many images a card will hold. This is a difficult question to answer and greatly depends on both the card and the camera it is used in. The number of images this card will hold on my 20D also depends on the settings used. Let me provide a few settings and image counts for an idea of what this card holds. <br /><br />Shooting Raw w/ISO 100 - 221 images <br />Shooting Raw w/ISO 800 - 206 images <br />Shooting Large jpeg - 479 images <br />Shooting Medium jpeg - 825 images <br />Shooting Small jpeg over 999 images (the 20D cannot provide counts above 999) <br /><br />I use both a 1GB and a 2GB card shooting primarily raw images. Sometimes the 1GB card is more than adequate, but other times I could easily fill the 1GB card quickly. There have been many days where I have taken 200-300 pictures without the opportunity to transfer my images. The 2GB card not only gives me more storage space, but also permits me to change the card in a slow moment before it completely fills up. It is truly aggravating to lose a shot because your card filled up. For these reasons I tend to prefer the 2GB cards. When considering the card size, one should attempt to balance convenience with capacity. Having one card for all your images may be convenient, but it is also putting all your eggs in one basket. <br /><br />Worried about reliability? The Extreme III cards have a dedicated technical support line (1-866-270-5532). Plus it's backed with a lifetime limited warranty outside Europe. The warranty excludes any defects, malfunctions, performance failures or damages to the card resulting from use in other than its normal and customary manner, misuse, accident or neglect; or improper alterations or repairs.<br /><br />If something should go wrong, this CF card comes with the Rescue Pro recovery software.  Fortunately I have had no need for the software.  For that purpose I cannot give much comment on its usefulness.<br /><br />Overall, I do not notice the benefits of this cards speed over the Ultra II when used with the 20D.  The other benefits between this and the Ultra II are not necessarily a big plus for me.  I like having the recovery software, so for the few extra dollars I am happy.  With a big price difference, I would definitely stick with the Ultra II.<br /><br />If the temperature ratings or the Rescue Pro recovery software is an important feature for you, the Extreme III is the card to get.  Otherwise, consider purchasing the Sandisk Ultra II CF Card and save some cash.<br /><br />PROS: <br />Reliable <br />Fast read/write <br />Impact resistant <br />Low power consumption <br />Backed by a lifetime limited warranty<br />Recovery software included<br /><br />CONS: <br />None

Fastest Card Yet For the Rebel XT
This is the fastest card yet as of March 28, 2005. Using the data collected at: http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/index.asp in the CF Database. I was able to make a more informed decision. I had my heart set on the Hitachi Microdrive 3GB when initially purchasing my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT 350D. However, after reviewing the results of the write speed tests, I immediately switched to the San Disc Extreme III. For my camera write speed using this CF is 4.888MB/sec JPEG and 6.263MB/sec RAW compared to the Hitachi Microdrive 6GB 3.466MB/sec JPEG and 4.584MB/sec RAW. Its highly recommended that you check out Rob Galbraith site to help sift through the confusion of which CF Card performs best with your camera.

Lightning speed writing
I use this card with my Nikon D200. The card writes data incredibly quickly, saving my raw 10.2 MP images with no problem. I've used this card in all sorts of conditions, from below freezing to well over 100 degrees with no problems.<br /><br />The data recovery software included is equally amazing. I was able to salvage pictures on my card I accidentally erased quite long ago with no loss. This comes with a warning--pictures you "deleted" remain on the camera, so it needs to be wiped securely before exchanging hands.<br /><br />Finally, this card while fast, is only as fast as the camera. If you don't need this speed, there are slower, cheaper ones available.

Fast Memory
With the large file size of pro DSLR's shot in RAW, every little bit of speed counts, whether at capture or download.  There are faster Compact Flash cards out there, and there are definately slower ones, but for the price, this is a great card.

Fast and works well
Great card. WHen I shoot in RAW +JPEG FIne format on my 10.2mpx Nikon, it gives 88 exposures. Accessing the memory is immediate, and it writes 3-shot bursts very fast. <br />Functions well although I haven't tested it in harsh conditions as yet.

Great Memory Card
I purchased this memory card for my Canon Digital Rebel XTi camera.  Great memory card...FAST...RELIABLE...NO PROBLEMS.  This memory card is able to keep up with the continuous shooting specs of the camera.  The 2gig card can hold a little over 100 shots taken in the RAW + Large JPEG picture mode on the camera.  In just the RAW mode, it can hold around 200 shots.

Downy Fresh!
These cards are fast. I have a Canon 30D and I've never been bogged down waiting for the cards to write. But here's a unique story. I own two of these cards. I have forgotten both of them in my shorts while doing laundry. Both cards have gone through the washer. They even got a dose of Downy. After discovering my mistake I laid them in a window in the sun to dry for a couple days. They work perfectly. I've had them since April '06 and neither has ever failed me. And they smell April fresh!

A Dependable CF Card
I use it for the D200 Nikon, which is a great pairing. I get exactly 224 shots at the highest jpeg setting. This card can really keep up, and can withstand extreme heat and cold temperatures. It comes with a CD-ROM for the recovery program, a plastic case, and a free neoprene-rubber card case.

Fast
I bought this card to use with the Cannon xti. The other card I have is not as fast and I can really see the difference when taking pictures and when transferring to my computer. It has a very fast read/write speed, it comes with recovery software and a cute little carrying case! I'm glad I decided on this SanDisk.<br />

Big and fast...and with amazon...value-priced and free shipping
I use this with my Canon Rebel XT, and it works fantastic. <br /><br />With 8+ MP camera, you need to have fast media or you might miss a moment.  I have had many SanDisk cards, and they have all worked flawlessly.  This one stays in my camera all the time, and I am hard-pressed to fill it up on a single shoot.<br /><br />This is the equivalent of dozens of rolls of film... (I dont shoot in RAW, but even if I did, it would be fine).

great card good price
After having great experience with the 1GB extreme III card, I ordered the 2GB just before I went on a short vacation. I love the speed of the extreme III cards - writing to the card I can actually exceed the camera's stated continuous frame (manual says about 9, but I've gotten over 20 in a row with before a delay) and reading the large amount of data off the card is similarly speedy when using a good usb 2.0 card reader. Sandisk just released the extreme IV cards, but for the price difference I think this card is a better deal.

SanDisk Extreme lll 2 GB compact Flash card
When you want speed, this card is awesome. With the D200, you need all the speed to write to the card as possible. This is the fastest card I have used. I recently shot with a friend who wanted all the photos on her cards. I used one of her "microdrives" and the thought came to me about "chugging"<br />Extreme III card, super fast--Microdrive, chugging. Not even close, and the 2 GB card holds more photos than the 1 GB microdrive. Excellent product.

None faster for Olympus
This card pays for itself with the security of not losing the digital shots you are trying to make. See the following link for some test times <br />http://myolympus.org/E300/writetime/<br /><br />The memory card no longer becomes the bottle neck when shooting pics. Nice fast card.

Excellent digital camera memory card!!!
I recently purchased this Sandisk compactflash to use with my Sony DSLR.  The camera has a burst mode (continuous picture taking) and this card was able to store multiple high quality pictures due to the high speed read/write capabilities, about 2-3 pictures per second.  For a 10.2 megapixel camera set to standard quality I am able to take around 500 pictures on this 2GB card.  I highly recommend for any DSLR.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Gets out of the way and lets me take pictures.
Like any good piece of technology, this card stays out of the way, operating fast (I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT), trouble-free (so far), and behind the scenes. I bought this model because it was the best price per storage space solution for the format at the time. I'm sure that very soon, that magical price point will shift to 4 GB or higher.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Speed, Speed, and More Speed
I use the 2 GB card, as well a the 1 GB version, in my 30D.  High speed bursts are not an issue at all.  While I've not exposed it to "extreme" conditions it has performed exactly as claimed.  I can't say how well the RescuePRO software works as I've never needed it.  I've never lost an image while using a SanDisk card...that includes the "regular" SD cards I use to use in my first digicam.  With the Extreme III being even more robust I have every confidence that I'll be using them for a long time to come.

Excelent Choice!
I'm very happy with the CF card. I'm also impressed with the attached software. This is excelent tool to recover lost pictures.

Fast is Fun
I wasn't convinced the extra cost associated with the extra speed of a Compact flash card was worth money but since I have been using the Extreme III I have changed my mind. It works faster in the camera, allowing me to get off more shots, especially capturing RAW files. <br />It works faster in the card reader allowing faster downloads, and, something I always avoided in the past, deleting while still on the card, is no longer a slow process.<br />When you consider how frequently you will be using a Compact Flash card the extra few bucks is trivial.

THIS CARD LIVES UP TO ITS NAME
I have taken over 4000 raw images on this card in a Canon 400D with no trouble. About a week after I bought it I accidentally left it in my pants pocket. This card went through the washing machine and 30 minutes in the dryer on high heat! I thought it was ruined but it survived and all my pictures were intact. Even the label is intact. Since then I have taken another 3000 pictures with no problems. It performs about the same in the camera as my 2gb Ultra II but the Extreme III transfers images to my computer much faster. I plan on buying a couple of the 4 gb version soon. Oh I also love the little card case that came with it. I leave it clipped to my camera strap.

Great value in a CF card
This is a great, fast CF card, and the Amazon price made it even better. Lets me shoot a t maximum speed in multi-shot mode, and doesn't slow camera start-up. Holds > 500 images at Large JPEG on my Rebel XT. A real steal!

Fast and Relaible
I bought this card for my Nikon D200 digital SLR, which I bought 2 months ago.  The Sandisk Extreme IV is much faster than this card, but you need the special card reader to download to a computer.  This card is fast enough for me, and much cheaper, especially when you include the cost of the card reader.  When shooting, card speed doesn't really matter with cameras like the D200, which write to a buffer that is way faster than any card out there.  So, if you don't mind waiting a few minutes for it to download, save yourself some money and get this instead of the IV.<br /><br />I shoot using the highest quality JPEG settings possible.  When the card is empty, the camera's display says it will hold 224 shots.  I've yet to fill the card completely before dumping the files to my laptop, but I know it will hold around 400 shots, assuming an average of 5 MB per file.<br /><br />It comes with file recovery software.  I haven't needed it so far, but it's nice to know it's there in case I have some sort of file emergency.<br /><br />I've been shooting digital since 2003, and while other brands have sometimes left me disappointed, Sandisk has never let me down.

Extreme III 2.0 GB is All That!
Extreme III is All That, for me and the family.Switching from RAW, and back so far is flawless. Temperatures seem to have no ill effect as long as I am using freshly charged batteries in extreme cold 32deg. or colder, no delay in summer conditions.<br />Since I purchased Extreme III 2.0 GB to use with my Canon Rebel XT camera, with 8MP this has been the best deal for my money.I could have bought cheaper CF cards; I believe you get what you paid for.I Purchased this CF Card after purchasing the SanDisk Ultra II 512MB. I only use the Ultra II as backup now, and likewise this still performs excellent.<br />My opinion; Great Price, Good deal.<br /><br />

Great for the Nikon D200 - SanDisk 2 GB Extreme III CompactFlash

Works a treat and price is good
Have now filled and refilled this card many times without a single glitch.<br />You can buy two of these cards for less than what I paid for a single 1GB 80x not that long ago, gotta love that. <br /><br />I will be buying more of these unless the IV comes down to these prices first.. May not see any transfer speed increase, but solid cards.<br /><br />

You won't be disappointed
Great card.  Comes with a nylon zipper pouch, I don't know why, but it comes in handy when you want to store other things in it.  Works great, works fast.  Warranty is also a big plus, lifetime.  You pay a little more but you won't be disappointed.  Beware of getting cheaper versions on ebay which has been known to be selling fake Sandisk cards which look identical to the real thing.  Real Sandisk cards have a serial number on the thin side of the card.

Good Mountain Bike;Bargain at $150
This is a good bike - the best feature is the dual suspension.  Light and easy dropping off curbs on the way to work - huge difference from my hardtail mountain bike.<br /><br />Disc brakes are nice to have, on front and rear - work much better than rim brakes.  To adjust them hold the brake lever in and tighten them down via a hex wrench on the opposite center of the disc brake until the pads are flush against the disc, then turn back until the brake lever has enough play in it.<br /><br />The rims are v-shaped, and narrow -  much more so than my other bikes.  It was quite a job to add tuffy liners to to the tires.  I think I will have a bike shop change the tire next time they need it.  The hard part is getting the tire off and on those narrow rims.  The people at REI said to squeeze on the sides of the tire as you put it on, so both ends go deep into the rim.<br /><br />Be careful when you put the front tire on that you have the fork facing forward.  (I had it backwards the first time).  Make sure the big round points on U part of the fork point towards the front of the bike.<br /><br />The tires are very knobby.  If you ride on the street a lot you might want to change them to something with a smoother tread in the middle.<br /><br />The bike weighs 38 pounds put together - not exactly light, but since I ride for pleasure and exercise, and don't plan to race, the weight is fine.<br /><br />If you get it for less than 150,  (what Amazon is selling it for the week of Feb  20), it is quite a bargain.  (disc brakes by themselves often add $100 to a bike).<br /><br />I raised the seat pretty high for a comfortable ride at my height, and found the handlebars are two low.  I fixed this by adding some handlebar extenders which allow me to be more upright when I am not braking.<br /><br />To my knowledge you can't raise the stem on the handlebars without adding a spacer.   If anyone finds out otherwise, please comment to this post.<br /><br />Another possibility (besides handlebar extensions), would be to replace the handlebar with one that has more of a rise to it.<br /><br />The Topkick is made by Kent Bicycle Company for GMC.  They also make some Cadillac Mountain Bikes - the Cadillac AM2.4 and AM2.7, which are sold on Amazon.  They are both dual suspension with disc brakes and have a very similar frame as the Topkick.  Both bikes sale for over $1000.<br /><br /><br />

Great
This is a great bike.<br />However, the shipping dented the chain and it costed me 40 dollars to get it repaired/new one. I called amazon and they gave me a refund for the money i had spent in no time. I have to say, amazon customer support is great (at least off holiday season).

Great bike, needs instructions....
First off, I ordered this bike from Amazon at $150 on March 5th and was told 4-6 week delivery at mid April being the estimated ship date. Luckily, I got it by March 20th, assembled it, and just took it out for a test ride. Overall I am very satisfied, it is a very solid bike worth every penny.<br /><br />As previous reviewers have mentioned, shipping quality isn't astounding, but it doesn't seem like I have any damaged parts other than slight frame scratches.<br /><br />Assembly is quite tedious and the only fault about this bike I could really come up with was the lack of instructions (besides the bike being a little bit heavy) but it isn't hard to figure out. Only tools you need are hex wrenches and pliers. Mounting the front brake was confusing and tweaking it to align right was tricky, make sure you understand which way to mount and how to tweak before assembling the brake. Also, make sure you screw the pedals in completely. I failed to do so and the pedal snapped out of place while riding, although I was able to fix it.<br /><br />The dual suspension is really nice to have as well as disk brakes (the main reason I opted for this model) and quick release tires/seat are nice. Seat is a little uncomfortable, shifting isn't that smooth, but both do the job.<br /><br />The rear suspension takes up space in the middle. I mounted a pump and lock on it but no room for water bottle. The kickstand is not your average  flimsy stick, very sturdy. Handle bars aren't the best but adequate. Be sure to tighten everything! <br /><br />The bike was worth every penny at $150 (keep in mind that it came with a claimed 4-6 week wait), jumped to $260 as of today. I'd say if it dropped under $200, get it.<br />

One well-designed, sturdy bike!
After shopping around and reading reviews of other bikes, I decided on buying this one, even though it was on the higher end of mountain bikes under $300.  I decided not to buy a road bike for two reasons: 1) the route I take to commute to and from work has many conditions unfavorable to road bikes and 2) the increased cost of road bikes.  My commute is about 13 miles from home and I've been riding this bike for almost a month now 2-4 days a week.  I can hop off sidewalks, run over speed bumps, go through gravel and dirt and the roughness/shock is substantially reduced due to the dual-suspension system on the bike.  The brakes and gearshifters (after properly adjusting them) make a comfortable fit.  The gears shift very smoothly from one speed to the next.  The pedals, though made of a plastic composite, haven't cracked or broken yet.<br /><br />Now onto the cons.  One of the first things I noticed after riding is that my inner seat bones would get sore if I rode the bike for more than two days consecutively.  Eventually, I had to replace the seat with something more comfortable.  It's something any male bicyclist should do anyway because the stock seat (and many others with similar design) can cause impotence after long-term use.  Secondly, the bike is on the heavier side weighing 38 lbs stock.  There's not much to be done about this because the frame is naturally heavy.  You can replace the tires and/or wheels, the seat, the handlebars, the pedals, and switch the disk brakes to rim brakes; but if you're going to do all that, you should probably get a more expensive bike that weighs less in the beginning.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase because I know that it's going to last me a long time.  For the amount of money that it costed, if it does get stolen I can't get too upset.  When I get tired of the weight of this bike (or if it gets stolen before then), I'll look into getting a more expensive, lighter bike.

Great bike for most users
I purchased this bike because the price was great and it came with dual suspension and front/rear disc brakes.  The only problem with the bike is that beginner tuners will have a hard time getting the brakes right as well as the gearing.  I paid a shop to get it all right for me, the bike works perfect now.<br /><br />I've taken this bike on long distances on and off road, down the stairs, up hills.  I rode this bike from Long Island to Manhattan with no problems, it's pretty light as well.  This bike is the best bang for the buck.  It's not no professional bike but it gets the job done.<br /><br />The only other problem with the bike is when your adding serious torque, the bike tends to flex in a way that the front derailleur kind of touches the chain.  It's a tiny problem and can be easily overlooked.  Also, GMC (or whoever made it) tends to keep the price resonable by adding outdated parts, like the shifter, etc.....that's not a problem for me.  New things always cost lots of $$$.<br /><br />My cousin purchased a bike shop recommended bicycle for almost $300 (front suspension only, and V type brakes), I payed $229 for my topkick.  Apparently this recommended bike is supposed to be better than the GMC topkick.  Turns out that the GMC topkick is lighter than this recommended bike and rides smoother.<br /><br />Once again, I recommended this bike for everyone.  Just remember to spend the extra $$$ to get a shop to tune it for you.

great bike
i Just got this bike today. took about an hour of assembly, and required a lot of tightening. as most people have already said, there are no instructions included, but assembly is pretty straight forward. shifting can be a little troublesome, but i think i need to do a little tweaking with that.

Great bike...however....
well i just recently got this bike. It came with no instructions...it was really easy to put together though. The front disk breaks have to be tweaked before its maiden voyage. Also the back gearshift needs to be adjusted before the first ride. Its a really nice bike for its price. Its a great bike i recommend it for anyone who likes dirt trails.

Worth The Money...
I bought this bike because it had pretty good reviews...and honestly, at 200 lbs. I needed a bike just a little more heavy duty than what was available in a dept. store...When it got delivered, I was quite impressed with the overall build and features of the bike. With dual disc brakes (that work great), quick release hubs and seat post, heavy duty V-rims... shimano componants...it really is quite a nice bike for the price. I've seen many argue that you should go to a bike shop for a bike...well, I looked around, you can expect to pay between well over $1000. to around $7000. for a dual suspension bike. GET REAL...I only paid $5100. for a brand new Honda XR-650 (motorcycle)...I've ridden this bike many times now without any problems. Keep in mind, however, that most bikes will need to be "fine tuned" when put together (brake adjustment, derailleur adjustment)These are very simple to do...If you arent sure, go to YouTube...you can find how-to videos there. All in all, I would surely recommend this bike to a friend if you are looking for something just a little nicer than your average dept. store bike.

Fantastic bike for the price
Let me start with some history.  Thirty years ago I worked a summer job as a Schwinn bicycle mechanic.  I loved that job.  In the process I assembled a ton of bicycles.  I also purchased a Schwinn Continental 10 speed.  Thirty years ago that was a great bike.  Even by today's standards it would be a cool bike.  That bike was stolen in 1982ish.  <br /><br />Move forward to 2006.  I started getting the itch to ride a bicycle again.  I tooled out to WalMart and bought one of those RoadMaster MtFurys for 53 bucks and rode it everyday.  I decided I wanted a road bike since I was riding farther and longer, week by week.  So, I ordered the 63cm GMC Denali from Amazon.  <br /><br />The bike arrived through the US mail in a box that looked like they dragged it behind the mail truck for a few miles.  I was worried that something was broken.  Nevertheless, I opened er up and the bike was fine.  They packed it in a manner that allows it to take a bit of a beating in shipping.  Since I was an old bicycle mechanic I never even opened the manual and put the bike together in about fifteen minutes.  Basically that requires air in the tires, mount the front, put the handlebar neck in place, put the seat in place, put the pedals on, adjust the brakes, and ride.  I chose to leave the reflectors off, for now.  <br /><br />My first impression was that I found it awkward to have to reach down to use the brakes.  I got used to that fast.  My second impression was how effortless it was to go fast on this bike, compared to the el-cheapo quasi mountain bike described above.  The 63cm, black and silver Denali, rides really smooth and the derailers are light years better than the ones on the MtFury.  I have never had, nor will I ever own and multi thousand dollar bicycle.  But, I will say that this bike is really fantastic for the price.  I am so impressed with the quality for under two hundred bucks.  <br /><br />The wheels and tires are quite narrow and 28 inches.  Combine that with the aluminum frame, shimano derailers and it performs very well.  <br /><br />Some folks don't like the twist shifters.  I find that I like it very much.  I didn't think I would but, I do.  <br /><br />I wasn't in a position to spend a grand plus on a road bike but, I was doing a lot of daily riding. This bike has met my needs perfectly.  The WalMart bike is I guess exactly the same thing except that it's a tad shorter.  At 6'2 I find that the 63cm bike has me pretty much maxed out.  I like it because it's tall but, if I were any shorter it would be awkward.  The height lets me really get the maximum out of a pedal stroke for power and speed.  <br /><br />If I had a complaint it would be that the gearing is a bit short.  That is that in top gear, on flat ground I max out the bike real quick.  If it had a taller gear I could get more speed.  The bike seems like it might be geared a bit short.  On the plus side a reasonably athletic person wont need to shift gears much.  Just keep her in top gear for most applications.  You can get on it and boogie on down the road right now.  <br /><br />The seat really aint bad.  If you think it is try that anvil on the MtFury.  Holy cow.  I like the pedals on the Denali.  They fit me perfectly.  <br /><br />Nothing in life is perfect.  But, for the price, you wont come close to his bike.  I promise you that.  Try it and see.  I looked at used bikes before I bought this one.  They were quite a bit more and looked rode hard and put up wet.  The cheapest bike I found, used, near this price was a raggedy old Raleigh that the seller wanted $175.00 for.  His bike had slick tires, scratches, and rust.  It rode like an old bike with slick tires and rust.  This bike rides tight and looks really nice.   I found a Specialized bike that looked completely used up that the seller wanted the cost of three of the GMCs for.  I decided that I could have three new bikes, back to back for the price of one bike that I wouldn't trust to get me around the block.  I bought the Denali.<br /><br />So, far I have ridden it a few hundred miles.  I had one flat tire that I patched on the fly and kept on riding.  It would be nice to have quick release axles.  But, I carry a sawed off 15mm box wrench in by tool pouch.  Works fine, last long time.  They say that this bike is heavy.  Come on now.  It's really not bad at all.  If I were in the tour de-whatever it might matter.  But, for a day of riding it's a great bike.  It's a heck of a lot lighter than what I was riding ya'll.    <br /><br />If this bike were to be stolen I would immediately buy another one.  <br />

Very Solid Bicycle
Very solid construction of the frame and materials. The gear shifting appears to be fine overalll to me, and conveniently placed on the handle bars. Because the bike is solid alumnium, it is fairly light and very durable. But a caveat emptor is that it is a bit heavier but stronger than other standard (bianchi, trek, giant) commuter road bikes since those tend to have a skinier aluminum frame while this one seems to follow Ford Motor Company's "built tough" motto. (lighter frame materials would be either titanium, carbon, some kind of composite: carbon and titanium frame bikes WILL cost you over $1500 new, at least) Another aspect people will easily miss is that the forks, unlike the frame, is made of steel so they're heavier than normal--but this is because while alumnium is lighter than steel, it is also stiffer which would make for a bone-jarring ride; the only real solution to this is to get 200-300$ all carbon forks that are super light and shock absorbing.<br /><br />A previous review complained about missing parts. That's not a serious problem since there is a full year's warranty on all parts: just give Kent a call. Also, the bike assembly is almost fool proof and can be easily done with an hour--there's literally maybe half a dozen big pieces to be assembled once you open the box, and the only free screw in for connectiong the rear light deflector. <br /><br />There 3 problems with the bike that may be minor to some: 1)the pedals feel awkward (maybe they're too small?) so that in order for your feet to stably and comfortably rest on them, you have to make an almost conscious effort to put your feet very close to the crank; the solution of course is to get some decent pedals 2)the shifting mechanism, as a previous review noted, is flawed. Only Shimano's own scale, it isn't even good enough to rank under their basic, introductory line (the revo shifters are more suited and designed for mountain bikes). The rear dereilleur is a bit off so that while upshifting is easy and smooth, downshifting by one gear is not possible. Solution, upshift 2 and then downshift by one gear, a bit more annoying but not exactly a difficult/lengthy task. For me, the shifting doesn't matter much. I use it in the city and there aren't any hills really demanding low gears; I go for speed, so if anything, I upshift (:-) 3)Lastly, although the bike is very good looking with a solid blue/black design, the paint on the seat seems a bit iffy. While the frame is certainly built like a rock, the seat paint has been continuously and consistently rubbing off on the sides so that strips of white underlying paink can be seen on the blue sides; of course, the actual material is still as strong as ever. I went online to check; turns out the brand, Cionlli, is actually a new taiwan manufacture who "propitiously" chose an Italian sounding name--you got to give it to them for trying! My solution to this was to go on ebay, and spend 25$ buying a top of the line, slightly used Bontrager racing seat, which, needless to say, is much lighter and more comfortable and durable.<br /><br />Other than these minor inherent material flaws, there are some potentially irritating assembly flaws. I believe that an earlier reviewer wisely (I didn't pay heed to him at first) that for any good bikes that is meant to last, proper assembly is vital (that means getting a bikeshop to assemble it). Now, I thought that he had meant small insignificant stuff like say tightening the screws with the proper amount of torque and etc....turns out there are other bigger problems. First, when I got the bike, the brakes were slightly misaligned so that when I used the brakes, one pad would hit the rim first, wearing it out much faster than the other. The next two problems are a great deal more irritating. My fork (preinstalled) had been installed backwards. This would seem to make a difference at first until I realized after looking at many bicycles that forks are bent forward ever so slightly in bikes; if you have it on backwards, the forks would be bend backwards slightly; this actually makes a huge difference: before I had the forks reinstalled correctly, the wheels were really close to the frame and pedals so that every time I turn the handle even a little (more than 20 degrees) to either side, my shoes or pedal would rub/catch against the wheels. The other problem deals with the shifting problem I mentioned earlier. Turns out the error was the the rear wheel had not been properly aligned with the frame so that the rear deraileur was a little off: the result was that shifting between adjacent gears was some times rough and often wouldn't work unless you did the shift 2 and then 1 back thing I did.<br /><br />All and all, still a bargain, especially compared to other Walmart bikes of the same price, and I've had quite a few of those not mention a few dozen problems associated with those disgusting contraptions. Wish the shifters were like the more expensive integrated Shimano Sora or 105 systems that are placed under the brake handles, but this was the best choice in my price range and those premium Shimano packages alone cost way more than this entire bike. This bike is definitely well worth it for the price and as long as nothing breaks, I'm more than elated with the purchase.

Such a Deal
Okay, so I wanted something simple to just ride around on, but I didn't want a mountain bike. I was looking for something like the old Varsity I had when I was a kid. The guys at the local bike shop were VERY helpful - really a nice bunch. But the bikes they had were just a bit more than I wanted to spend for something I wasn't sure I would stick with, given my lazy nature. So enter the trusty Internet! The Denali caught my eye and my wallet didn't go into a seizure when I saw the price. Under [...] is something that I could live with, and if my lazy side reared it's ugly head, I could always sell it at a garage sale. So I ordered it. I gotta tell ya', this bike is great! It went together easy, MUCH easier than that BBQ grill that's still unfinished in the garage (told you I was lazy!)and it looks pretty darn nice. I throw a leg over and hit the streets. Brakes work - that's a plus! Shifting is okay, but it's a little hesitant between 2 gears (more on THAT later!), I like the twisty shifter thingys. They click into each gear and I can see what gear I'm in without having to look at the chain. Overall, I'm pretty comfortable on the bike in a matter of minutes, and speaking of minutes - 45 of them fly by before I realize I'm actually EXERCISING!!!! Not wanting to burn off ALL 30 of my excess pounds in one ride, I head home. The big shock is yet to come - I've actually done it several times since then!! Okay, I'm no Lance Armstrong or anything, but I'm averaging 2-3 days a week for the past month on this bike. Hmmmm, now that Sheryl Crow is single, and I know she likes bike riders, maybe I should give her a call? Anyway, back to the bike. I like it a lot! It was affordable, rides nice, and got my fat [...] off the couch and outside - what more could I ask for? Oh, and that clicky shifting thing? I called the customer service line and they gave me the bike tech guy, don't remember his name, but he told me how to adjust the gears. He simplified it for me and with a 5 minute adjustment, the bike now shifts great. So all things considered, I'd have to say that this bike is really a sweet deal. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg, holds up to an overweight guy, looks cool, doesn't fall apart, and gets you outside. I kinda wish it wasn't named for a big giant SUV though.

Fantastic bike for the price
Let me start with some history.  Thirty years ago I worked a summer job as a Schwinn bicycle mechanic.  I loved that job.  In the process I assembled a ton of bicycles.  I also purchased a Schwinn Continental 10 speed.  Thirty years ago that was a great bike.  Even by today's standards it would be a cool bike.  That bike was stolen in 1982ish.  <br /><br />Move forward to 2006.  I started getting the itch to ride a bicycle again.  I tooled out to WalMart and bought one of those RoadMaster MtFurys for 53 bucks and rode it everyday.  I decided I wanted a road bike since I was riding farther and longer, week by week.  So, I ordered the 63cm GMC Denali from Amazon.  <br /><br />The bike arrived through the US mail in a box that looked like they dragged it behind the mail truck for a few miles.  I was worried that something was broken.  Nevertheless, I opened er up and the bike was fine.  They packed it in a manner that allows it to take a bit of a beating in shipping.  Since I was an old bicycle mechanic I never even opened the manual and put the bike together in about fifteen minutes.  Basically that requires air in the tires, mount the front, put the handlebar neck in place, put the seat in place, put the pedals on, adjust the brakes, and ride.  I chose to leave the reflectors off, for now.  <br /><br />My first impression was that I found it awkward to have to reach down to use the brakes.  I got used to that fast.  My second impression was how effortless it was to go fast on this bike, compared to the el-cheapo quasi mountain bike described above.  The 63cm, black and silver Denali, rides really smooth and the derailers are light years better than the ones on the MtFury.  I have never had, nor will I ever own and multi thousand dollar bicycle.  But, I will say that this bike is really fantastic for the price.  I am so impressed with the quality for under two hundred bucks.  <br /><br />The wheels and tires are quite narrow and 28 inches.  Combine that with the aluminum frame, shimano derailers and it performs very well.  <br /><br />Some folks don't like the twist shifters.  I find that I like it very much.  I didn't think I would but, I do.  <br /><br />I wasn't in a position to spend a grand plus on a road bike but, I was doing a lot of daily riding. This bike has met my needs perfectly.  The WalMart bike is I guess exactly the same thing except that it's a tad shorter.  At 6'2 I find that the 63cm bike has me pretty much maxed out.  I like it because it's tall but, if I were any shorter it would be awkward.  The height lets me really get the maximum out of a pedal stroke for power and speed.  <br /><br />If I had a complaint it would be that the gearing is a bit short.  That is that in top gear, on flat ground I max out the bike real quick.  If it had a taller gear I could get more speed.  The bike seems like it might be geared a bit short.  On the plus side a reasonably athletic person wont need to shift gears much.  Just keep her in top gear for most applications.  You can get on it and boogie on down the road right now.  <br /><br />The seat really aint bad.  If you think it is try that anvil on the MtFury.  Holy cow.  I like the pedals on the Denali.  They fit me perfectly.  <br /><br />Nothing in life is perfect.  But, for the price, you wont come close to his bike.  I promise you that.  Try it and see.  I looked at used bikes before I bought this one.  They were quite a bit more and looked rode hard and put up wet.  The cheapest bike I found, used, near this price was a raggedy old Raleigh that the seller wanted $175.00 for.  His bike had slick tires, scratches, and rust.  It rode like an old bike with slick tires and rust.  This bike rides tight and looks really nice.   I found a Specialized bike that looked completely used up that the seller wanted the cost of three of the GMCs for.  I decided that I could have three new bikes, back to back for the price of one bike that I wouldn't trust to get me around the block.  I bought the Denali.<br /><br />So, far I have ridden it a few hundred miles.  I had one flat tire that I patched on the fly and kept on riding.  It would be nice to have quick release axles.  But, I carry a sawed off 15mm box wrench in by tool pouch.  Works fine, last long time.  They say that this bike is heavy.  Come on now.  It's really not bad at all.  If I were in the tour de-whatever it might matter.  But, for a day of riding it's a great bike.  It's a heck of a lot lighter than what I was riding ya'll.    <br /><br />If this bike were to be stolen I would immediately buy another one.  <br />

Beyond Satisfied
This bike computer, for the price, is by far the best on the market. How do I know? Because there is no other bike computer that boasts a name brand company, has as many features, and costs as little as this one! I made sure to read all the reviews on Amazon before I purchased this, and I find it disheartening that I was almost swayed to *not* buy it. Fortunately, I read between the lines of all the negative comments and figured their age and/or grammar explained why they had difficulties with the device.<br /><br />To start, almost everyone is correct in stating it's difficult to install; honestly, it is! The instructions suggest a 1mm distance between the magnet and the sensor, which basically means: as close as you can get it without the two pieces hitting! To achieve this, the task takes a considerable amount of fiddling, but once you find the right spot on the fork and spoke to where they come closest without hitting, you're golden. I spent about 10 minutes doing this. After the magnet and sensor were on, the setup of the computer was a breeze. It asked for wheel diameter (which is required if you want accurate readings of speed, distance, etc), age, weight, time settings, etc. If you read the instructions, it will explain how to set each of these values. <br /><br />I want to address a few of the complaints on this page. The first was from a young man who said he was riding 60 mph. Your problem: you didn't set the correct wheel diameter! The instructions provide you a handy chart to tell you what code to type in based on the corresponding diameter. Now, if you don't know what a diameter is, or don't have the intelligence to look it up online, you probably shouldn't be using this computer in the first place. If your wheel is 26" and you set it to 15", yes, you will not have the correct and accurate display of your speed!<br /><br />I read another review that said he couldn't figure out what buttons to push. Answer: READ THE DIRECTIONS! The directions tell you what to push, for how long, and when. They do this for all displays and all features. If you can't figure that out, I don't know what else to tell you. Honestly, there are 2 buttons, are you that stupid?<br /><br />I read another review that said distance traveled couldn't be reset, nor could the calories or fat burned. WRONG! Yet again, people fail to actually *read* the instructions, and have the nerve to come online and submit a negative review. There are 7 displays that are shuffled with the *right* button. The *odometer* display does not reset, because it's just that, an odometer. Do you reset your car odometer, too? What you're looking for is the *tripmeter* display. The tripmeter can be reset by holding the *left* button for 2 to 3 seconds. When you reset the tripmeter, you also reset the trip timer, and the average speed value which was set during your previous trip. To reset the calories burned or fat burned, go to that feature display, and hold the left button for 2 to 3 seconds. Simple enough?<br /><br />In summary: this computer is accurate in all its features if you read the instructions and input the correct wheel diameter. Speed, distance traveled, average speed, trip timer, temperature, and everything else, I have found to be 100% accurate. I checked the speeds against a driver and the temperature against a 3rd party thermostat. Since I've only used this product for a couple weeks, I can't tell you how durable or what's its longevity will be, but if the features and accuracy mean anything, I should be using this computer for a long time.<br /><br />Quick note to everyone who set this thing up wrong and feels foolish for complaining: if you input the wrong diameter, press both buttons down at the same time for 3 seconds and it will reset the whole device so you can input data from scratch. If your speedometer is reading out "0.0" while you ride, you have the sensor and magnet setup wrong. Try to align the magnet with the arrow next to the "Sensor" text.<br /><br />The key to having a pleasurable experience with this bike computer is to read the instructions. If you don't feel like reading instructions, don't buy this. If you feel you can bare with the idea of reading a bit and want a great piece of hardware at the lowest price on the market, BUY this device.<br /><br />***<br />*** Updated ***<br />***<br /><br />Okay, I've uploaded the manual scans to the user submitted images area.<br />However, since Amazon re-size the images, here they are on TinyPic hosting...<br /><br />[...]<br />You can find all the above 4 larger pieces of the manual on one page, as well, here: [...]

Good for estimating speed and distance, but nothing else
When you set this thing, its best to measure the outside circumference of your tire using a tape measure then convert this to mm for the "wheel factor". For example Bontrager 700 x 35C tire has an outer diameter of 2197 mm. <br /><br />If you try to cheat this by multiplying pi times twice the outer radius you will get an error that will very quickly accumulate even on short rides (I observed an -11% error with both the speed and distance traveled).<br /><br />Once this is set, decide on km/hr or mph and fill in the rest of the setup. Afterwards, take the bike on the road for a few miles then check with Google Maps or your car's odometer to see if your distance traveled is reasonable. That is how I was able to determine the distance error.<br /><br />The calorimeter is off by -25% on average. You're best off using the formula: <br /><br />CalBurned = Hours x 60 x (-55.0969 + (0.6309 x AvgHeartRate) + (0.1988 x Weightlb x 0.45359237) + (0.2017 x Age) )/4.184 <br /><br />[from "Prediction of energy expenditure from heart rate monitoring during submaximal exercise", L. R. KEYTEL, J. H. GOEDECKE, T. D. NOAKES, H. HIILOSKORPI, R. LAUKKANEN, L. VAN DER MERWE, & E. V. LAMBERT that was published in the Journal of Sports Sciences.] to find a better estimate of calories burned. <br /><br />I reccomend the blue Nike triax C8 Heart Rate monitor to help you out with this. A reasonably accurate way to find max heart rate is <br /><br />MaxHR = 205.8 - (0.685 x Age)     <br />[Journal of Exercise Physiology (2002)]<br /><br />One final note: the time recorded by this computer is the total time in motion, so if you stop for traffic or breaks your average speed isn't greatly effected.

Neat gadget for the money
Has more functions than others yet less expensive. Works great! Displays time, distance travelled, speed and other useful stuff.

What a deal!
Although this model is not wireless, I was surprised that it was so easy to set up and has so many functions for the price. I ran this computer on one of my bikes while using a 75.00 Topeak wireless model on another bike and the Schwinn was just as accurate. The extra functions such as calories burned were also a nice feature. Unless this breaks early, it can't be beat for the price.

Wheel factor
Great Bike computer, works great, so cheap I bought two of them, wires don't look that messy, don't need an expensive wireless one, you can use clear tape to join the wire with brake wires.<br /><br />Since everyone will need wheel factor, this is what I found from Trek's websites:<br /><br />Wheel/Tire Size  CIRCUMFERENCE in mm(Wheel Factor)<br />16" 		1300         <br />20" X 1.75" 	1600 <br />24" X 1.95" 	1920 <br />26" X 1" 	1950  <br />650 X 20C 	1945 <br />650 X 23C 	1990 <br />26" X 1.5" 	2030 <br />26" X 1.9" 	2055 <br />26" X 2.0" 	2074 <br />26" X 2.2" 	2100 <br />700 X 20C 	2074<br />700 X 23C 	2085<br />700 X 25C 	2100<br />700 X 28C 	2135<br />700 X 32C 	2155 <br />700 X 35C 	2175<br />700 X 38C 	2180<br />700 X 40C 	2190<br />700 X 1-1/4" 	2160<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Deepak

Well built device definitely worth more than you pay for
All the features you want and then some. It is well designed with many great functions. Its main purpose is a speedometer with an odometer, trip meter, max speed indicator, average speed indicator, trip timer which measures how much time you've been riding, temperature indicator, counts calories, and fat burned. The speedometer function is very accurate. I compared my vehicle gps nav to the cyclometer and both readings are the same, however it is only as accurate as the wheel size you input, as other reviewers complained of readings too fast or slow and that is because of the wheel size that is input as the preset wheel size is for a 26.6" wheel, and an actual wheel that is not that size will obviously show innacurate readings. Anything smaller will show faster readings, anything bigger will do the opposite. Don't throw away the instructions as scrolling through the functions takes a while to get used to. Also they have the wheel size "codes" since the wheel size input is a 4 digit number and will be needed everytime you reset the cyclometer or replace the battery. You can even RESET all the functions seperately, just hold the left button for a few seconds over the selected function and thats it. The installation was easy after reading the instructions. <br /><br />The price is cheap, the product is not. It is worth way more than $9.99 for the functions and quality. I previously bought a similar schwinn 12 function cyclometer from walmart and it had solid features for the same price and this unit has added features for the same price. I gave the old unit to my wife and installed this product on my bike, I didnt even have to reinstall the wiring on my bike since the detachable computer is compatible with both sensors and docking stations. One of the functions on this cyclometer is a "maintenance program" but isn't explained how it works or what it does in the manual other than its existance. The unit also has a backlight which is also unexplained in the manual, to operate the light you have to press the left button. The light is good and makes the unit very visable at night. The only issue with the light is that when pressed, the speedometer speed is "frozen" the whole time the light is on. Your current speed wont update until the light is off, I found that to be irritating since you have to press the light many times to check your speed if your speed varies. A very handy feature is that the unit is detachable, which is good if you store your bike outside since it might rain and ruin the computer. Also if you run the wiring up the front brake cable, the entire setup will blend in and be hard to notice. This product is a definite buy, even if it was worth $50, it would still be worth it. At $9.99 its value is unbeatable.

Works great!
pd = f<br />p  = 3.1416 (pi)<br />d  = diameter of tire in millimeters<br />f  = wheel factor<br /><br />I was a little confused at first, but after fiddling around with it for awhile, and reading what others have said about it here, I finally got it setup right, and it works great. Like others have already said, you need to get the proper wheel factor entered. You can figure out the wheel factor with the above formula, or just measure the circumference of your tire and convert that to millimeters to get the wheel factor.

All the function you could ever want
Even has a back light! It was easy to install and i love seeing my speed progress.

Terriffic Gadget -- Weak Installation Instructions
I have only used this thing for a day, so I can't speak for the long term.<br /><br />Installation is not difficult once you understand what to do.  The instructions are poor.  For example, instructions for mounting the bracket to the handle bars say, "Using a Philips screwdriver attach the mounting bracket to the right side of the handlebar."  This was the first sentence in the first task I tried to do. There are NO screws at all! The bracket is attached with cable ties.  And, I can see absolutely no reason it has to be on the right side of the handlebar.  As you can see from the pictures I posted, my bike has a reflector attached to the right, so I had to put it on the left.  In short, everything in the first sentence of the first instruction I tried is wrong.  <br /><br />They tell you to install the sensor and magnet first.  I feel strongly this is a mistake.  I think you should install the handlebar bracket first.  This makes it easier to route the cable, position it and wind up the extra slack.  <br /><br />The sensor goes on the inside of the right fork - facing the spokes.  You may be able to mount it on the left fork, but the easiest way to route the sensor cable is to wrap it around the front brake cable which (at least on my bike) is on the right side.  <br /><br />The magnet clamps to a spoke immediately beside the sensor.  The fork is vertical but the spokes are not -- they're angled. So, you cannot mount the magnet parallel to the sensor.  Getting the two parts to align and not strike requires you move the sensor up and down the spoke until the two parts are close without touching - see my close-up picture of these two parts installed. <br /><br />When I first installed it I thought it wasn't working because I would move the wheel and no speed appeared.  I discovered there's a brief delay before the speed appears so you need to have a little patience.  I agree with the review that says you should test the device by moving the magnet near the sensor before beginning installation.  This give you confidence it's working if you have trouble getting the parts aligned good enough.<br /><br />Setting up the meter for the first time was a little confusing.  When you initially turn it on it steps you through a procedure to input the various setup data.  You have to reset everything to change any of these settings, so get the numbers you need together before you start, or step through without entering anything so you know what will be needed.  You probably know everything except the wheel circumference in millimeters (millimeters? -- let's get a rough number in fine detail).  If you know your wheel and tire size (which is on the tire) you can get the number from a table in the instructions.  Other reviewers have made a big thing of measuring your rolling distance to do this.  I didn't do it, and I can't see why it's necessary.  If you miss the value by the maximum amount possible on the chart for a given wheel size it can't be off more than 1mph when going 20mph (or a distance of 1 mile in 20), and if you use the correct number from the chart it'll be a lot more accurate.  Now, if the numbers in the table are wrong that's another thing.  Maybe somebody who's compared his measured results with the table for his tire will post the difference and how much error that would cause in 20 miles.   But remember, this $10 gadget isn't intended to be used by the national bureau of standards.<br /><br />Once installed and setup it works great.  I like the current speed, the average speed, the distance traveled, and time peddling (it stops the clock when you stop moving).  The meter snaps in and out of the mounting bracket easily.  As someone said, you don't have to reset everything to reset your trip data.  Toggle to the DST (distance traveled) display and hold down the left button for a few seconds.  This will reset the distance traveled, the trip timer and the average speed.  The odometer accumulates total distance traveled since the last master reset.<br /><br />The magnet isn't held in place very tight and I wonder if it will tend to move, but not so far in about an hour's riding.  <br /><br />I can't see how you can beat this gadget for the price.  <br /><br />PROS:  Works great.<br />CONS:  Installation instructions weak. <br /><br />Edited 10 hours later to add:<br /><br />I can now speak to long term reliability.  It failed since I wrote my review 10 hours ago, and 24 hours since I installed it.  It's not the battery, because if you press one of the buttons the display lights up and the button functions work properly.  It has to be the sensor signal not working, and I've seen similar complaints in these reviews. Oh well, it was great for the one hour of use I got.  <br /><br />NOTE:  Rating is now based on how it worked yesterday.<br /><br />Edited again two-three weeks later:<br /><br />I now have one that's been working properly for more than a week.  The things I said in my original review are still true, except getting the magnet in the right position was a little fussier than the first time, but still not bad.  Start with it a little further away than the 1mm they say.  Start with 1/8".  If this works leave it there.<br /><br />I have now checked the accuracy using the wheel/tire size numbers in the table. It is very accurate. I compared it with an actual distance measured with a GPS I carried with me.  It was within one percent.  This means that at one hundred miles the distance would be within a mile.  Air pressure differences should create a larger error.  Your car's odometer isn't as accurate.  Given this, I see no point to measuring your wheel diameter unless it's not in the table.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the device.

Bike Computer
Order delivered as promised through Amazon.  The 17-function bike computer is pretty cool.  I used the standard wheel settings that were available on the directions and it comes close to measuring distance that I measured with my car.  It has more options that I needed since all I care about was distance, time, speed, and trip time.  I replaced the small cable ties that came with the bike computer with larger 8" cable ties since I use it on a mountain bike and the vibration seemed to affect the performance of the product.  Once replaced everything was fine. It does have a back light that can be activated and the odometer can be reset if it ever gets wiped out.  Also, all reviews written by everyone else was abig deciding factor to purchase.

Awesome!
I love the multiple functions this trip computer gives me.  I tend to leave it at speed and temperature.  I now know how fast I am going, and be able to better estimate my arrival time.  Highly recommended purchase for any bike.

Best Investment For My Bike
This product ROCKS!!!! The only thing is, since I've received and installed it I ride everyday.  Its addicting.  The installation was easy and the functions work great.  I've put over 300 miles on my bike in under a month. I went from riding about 2-3 miles a day to between 10-15 miles a day 6 times a week.  Liked it so much I purchased this one for my wife :)

Great item for the price
Easy to install and keeps great track of how miles ridden.  The speedometer is very accurate as well.  Don't be frightened by other posts, if you are some what intelligent and can screw in a light bulb.  Then this is the product for you.  Take care everybody

Great product at great price
I like this product so much I brought a second one within days of purchasing the first one. The first one I put it on my bike, the second one I put it on my electric scooter. In both cases it is simple to install and work great. I only use speed and distance function.

FIVE STARS without a doubt!!
Bang for buck..this cyclometer cannot be beat! For $10 you have a small, easily mounted device that tells you all you need to know. But, let's face it..a running MPH is what all cyclists care about as they ride. This thing does it all as well...odometer, temperature..sure..stuff no one really needs in the real world, even has a back light for night riding. What more could you need? You might have to "fiddle" with the spoke sensor to get a good pickup..but they are all that way. However, once you have adjusted your spoke sensor, it stays true no matter how many bumps and jumps you do. It's a cool little machine that is WAY  worth the money...I can't imagine anyone paying $30-50 for anything else..wasted cash. Buy one of these things before Schwinn figures out how good they are and jacks up the price!  Good riding!

bright, efficient headlight
I've had mine for almost two years of heavy use.  The light is very bright, providing a great deal of visibility and some illumination of the road in front, which is enough for the city, and batteries last a very long time.  Most pleasingly, the mounting system is very durable and it seems likely that it will withstand several years of regular use.  The unit appears to be impervious to rain.  As with all of the gear I've purchased from Planet Bike, a superior level of design is evident.  A good, basic LED headlight.

Very very good product ......at a very good price
Very good product .......bought it after reading the reviews on here . I was still a bit skeptical about the actual quality  of light which would come out of this bicycle light ,but I was sure not dissapointed  . The beam which comes out , is very bright and very focussed . It forms a small circle / elliptical shape on the light beam in front and very clear + bright . <br /><br />Has 2 modes - flashing and constant-on <br /><br />The light can be seen ffrom a far distance away . The color of the light is white instead of yellow , so was easier to spot when far away . Like I said , its very bright and with the flashing mode , would definatly warn the drivers of your presence . A very good buy , you would not be dissapointed , go for it . <br /><br />Have not used the for the quick cam mount , just using it as a bike light on my handle bars .....

Well-designed and energy-efficient and mount is perfect
Some reviews have mentioned problems with the mount being too loose. That's not the case - the mount strap is adjustable and at its loosest setting out of the box. It retracts inward to tighten up, and there is a tab there to loosen it back up. I had no problems having a good, tight fit on my bike after adjusting the strap.<br /><br />The light is very bright and energy-efficient. In comparison, my previous equally-bright halogen headlight required two C batteries and lasted for a tiny fraction of the time.<br /><br />Overall excellent design.<br />

For What It is, It is Great
This 3-LED bicycle headlight is designed to be bright enough to fill in what street-lights don't.  For this it is great but don't expect to be able to go biking through dark woods with it.  The price is reasonable, and the mounting is secure.  You won't be dissapointed.

Great Safety Light
This is a great little safety light, but understand that it is a safety light. That is to say it is a "see this and don't hit me" light vs. "let me see what I'm about to hit". Its not designed to illuminate the road in front if you, your need something with a lot more wattage and $ for that task. This little guy is designed to alert others to your existence so they don't turn you into a hood ornament. <br /><br />I considered this unit vs. some of the smaller safety lights. I settle on this one for a couple of reasons<br />1 - It takes 2x AA batteries vs. 2x "N" cells which can be a pain to find.<br />2 - It seems way more durable. Good solid plastic (yea, its still plastic).<br />3 - Changing the batteries is very easy and doesn't require any tools or frustration. The front of the unit rotates, unlocks comes off.<br />4 - I'm going to guess its better weather sealed than the other units. <br />5 - Its brighter but not too bright, I ride with a group at night and I didn't want the flashing thing to give off too much like as this can be distracting in some scenarios. <br /><br />On the down side it is bigger, bulkier and heavier than some of the smaller units, but that's the price you pay for AA.<br /><br />The light it puts out seems adequate for the job. Its equal to a medium grade LED headlamp. The button is a bit hard to push but won't be accidentally activated. The first push makes it flash, the second push is steady and the next push turns it off.<br /><br />The mount is nice in that it doesn't require a screw driver to mount, though it is a bit more complicated. I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't fit on my oversized handlebars but it had enough play. <br /><br />The mount is adjustable in two ways. First there is a click slide (kind of like a zip tie) that lets you make adjustments by sliding a plastic belt into a click buckle (you can always lift it up and let it out). Then there is the mounting screw. It's a bit complicated but it threads into a rotating block at the top. By adjusting the amount of screw that goes through the block you increase or decrease the diameter of the mount. The final torque is applied with a flip lever that holds the other half of the screw. So you get it close with the sliding band, then do the find adjustments with the screw and lock it down with the flip lever. Complicated but saves the need for a screwdriver. There is also small rubber sleeve on part of the band to help prevent slippage.<br /><br />So in summary<br /><br />Pros<br />Durable<br />Uses AA batteries<br />Good output<br />Easy to change batteries<br /><br />Cons<br />Bigger than others<br />Tough switch.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If your looking for a safety light that runs on AA's look no further. They make the 5 LED version for a few bucks more, not a significant difference in output though.<br />

much better than I expected
I bought this light after suffering through several department store purchases. I can't believe how much money I could have saved if I had just bought this light to begin with. It is very well made and gives a good solid light. I noticed too that it was a bit loose on the handle bars even though I did tighten the strap as suggested by another reviewer. Electrical tape solves the problem. I'm even thinking of buying another one so I can have dual headlights.

Better than I expected
This light really lights up the road well. It's easy to install. Some have mentioned it don't fit tight enough on the bar handle.  I just wrapped some electrical tape around the bar enough so when I installed it on my bar it was snug.

Blinding!
<br /><br />Currently, I have four bicycle taillights in my possession, including the new Cateye Opticube. The superflash is by far the brightest. Interestingly, it is also the smallest and weighs in at a diminutive 53 grams. When I first opened the box, I was actually disappointed as I expected something 2-3 times as large. Planet Bike truly hit a homerun with the Blinky Superflash. <br /><br />With the incredible brightness of the main LED, this light is visible from a distance on a sunny day at noon. I haven't seen anything like it. In addition to the sheer intensity, visibility is enhanced by an interesting flash pattern that combines two smaller LEDs to produce a Morse-code-like signal. <br /><br />As far as I can tell at this juncture, there are no design flaws with the Superflash. For my purposes, however, I would have preferred a larger clip for use on my backpack. <br /><br />Pros <br />Extremely bright <br />Small <br />Built-in reflector <br />Sturdy housing <br /><br />Cons <br />Could use a slightly larger clip for attaching to a backpack (very minor) <br />Too directional (i.e. not enough spread)

more top-notch bike gear from Planet Bike
I had to toss my otherwise serviceable Blackburn rear light when the brittle plastic mounting clip failed after about two years of use.  Determined to purchase a quality replacement, the Planet Bike brand was the obvious choice. Like the well-worn Planet Bike headlight I've been using, this model taillight is made from a durable plastic that resists cracking from normal patterns of wear, such as accompanies attaching and detaching lights from their mounts when parking bikes.  Anyone who rides a lot in the city knows that leaving lights attached to parked bikes is a bad idea.  Since the Planet Bike people are avid cyclists, their designs reflect this consideration and the result is durable mounting systems.  It is also worth mentioning that this light is extremely bright, rivaling car taillights for visibility on dark streets.  A very fine piece of gear from a company run by enthusiasts and definitely not the last item I'll buy from this company.

Second only to the DiNotte.
I have used the Superflash since it hit the market last year. Planet Bike has definitely hit a home run with this one. It's very affordable, cheaper than the much-vaunted Cateye LD-100, but it's brighter than everything but the DiNotte($150+). I use a Superflash on my seatbag, and one on the blinky strap on my Bell Metro helmet(another excellent product). Those two lights get me plenty of respect from motorists. <br /><br />If money is no object, buy the DiNotte. It's the best light available. 140 lumens of red flasher will get the job done. But using a couple of Superflashes is an excellent choice. Bright, attention getting, lightweight, affordable, and made by a company who gives money to bicycle charities. I love it.

almost blinded myself!
Just got this taillight in the mail a week or so ago and I am still amazed how bright it is!  I ride a Sun EasySport AX recumbent bike and the smaller of the 2 mounts fits perfect on the frame of the seat. It's easy to remove from the mount and clip on shirt,belt or pack.  I was using another led taillight, unsure of the brand, and it looks like a dim nightlight compared to the Super Flash.  There may be brighter taillights out there, though you'd probably have to get one of those expensive battery-hogging strobes to do it.  This is the only LED taillight I've yet seen that even mentions the word "watt".  If you've ever used a Luxeon LED flashlight, they start at I think 1 watt, well this thing seems about that bright!  Although I haven't tried it yet during daytime rides, I'm pretty sure that it will be seen then too.  Just don't look directly at it from close range.

Brightest light ever!!
This is the ONE light if you want to be seen at night. It is unbelievably bright. Don't get the one with the black back as that is an older model and no where as bright as this one. EVERYONE who sees this light gets one as it is the brightest they've ever seen!!

Great blinky, night AND day!
I bought this light after seeing it on another bike during the middle of the day... the blinding flasher was visible even in bright sunlight!  And at night, it's killer good.  Now that I've got it on my bike I run it night and day.  It's good on batteries, and even if it wasn't , who cares?  For the cost of a couple of triple A batteries this light does a great job of increasing my visibility and keeping me safe.

Just the Best
I'm a year-round, all-weather, night-and-day bike commuter.  I don't need the lightest, newest, top-grade drivetrain components or a custom titanium frame, and I'm not about to pay for them.  But good lights are one thing I do need, and I don't mind paying top dollar for the added safety.  (I have a top-of-the-line Dinotte combo for my bar/helmet lights.)<br /><br />Happily, though, I don't seem to need to shell out big money for a tail light.  I've tried various models, but this little guy is just the best.  I could pay a LOT more and get the ridiculously bright Dinotte tail light, but why?  This little Planet Bike is already insanely visible, and dirt cheap.<br /><br />I've had mine (the Stealth) out in all weather, all year, and the thing just. never. fails.  I see others have reported switch problems, but none here.  Besides, they're so cheap, just buy 2; toss one in your blowout bag and you've got a backup tail light every bit as good as your main, that clips instantly onto the same mounting hardware. Buy the non-Stealth model for your backup.  It's even cheaper.<br /><br />A couple of other nice features:<br /><br />1. It seems to be extremely easy on batteries.  After several months, I finally changed mine out just because I thought surely they must be getting low.<br /><br />2. The Stealth model really is virtually invisible when it's not blinkifying.  Mine's mounted on one of my seat stays, and if you're not looking for it, you just don't see it.<br /><br />In short, I love this thing.  It's one of those extremely rare consumer products that does exactly what it should do, does it extremely well, and costs what it ought to: it's the Craftsman wrench of bicycle lights.

Amazing Device Straight out of Star Trek
Purchased this because of the great reviews online.  It is super compact and SUPER BRIGHT!  If you strapped a couple of these on the roof of your car people would pull over.  The only better way to be seen on a bike would be to set yourself on fire!  Great product with an amazing price.

If you need a rear bicycle light, look no farther
I read the very positive reviews on Amazon before deciding to try the Planet Blinky Super Flash.  I have several LED flashlights and I knew the 1/2 watt LED would be bright, but you have to see this to believe it.  It is small and light and easy to install with several mounting options. I ride 4 times a week on public roads so I use this exclusively during the day on flashing mode.  I don't think it is my imagination but cars give me a wider berth than before installing this light.  My wife said she could see my flashing light over a mile ahead on a bright Arizona day.  If you want to be really seen, then this is the only rear bicycle light to buy.  I've had it for over two months and I'm still on the same batteries that came with the unit!

Great Little Light!
I bought two Planet Bike Superflashes for a recent bicycle tour of Coastal Oregon and Northern California.  My intent was to mount them to the flat light bracket on my Tubus rear rack, but there were no provision on the Superflashes for mounting to a flat surface...  What to do?  After trying several options I cut an old inner tube to the length of the mounting plate, split that section of inner tube, and then slipped it over the mounting plate.  This worked something like an elastic waste band and the two Superflashes clipped easily and securely to the rubber-covered light mount.  I checked the configuration a couple of times during the tour and it held up well; no adjustments required.  The superflashes worked superbly during the tour.  We cycled during conditions that ranged from rainy, to foggy, to low light (under canopies of Redwoods), to sunny and the superflashes were always on while we were on the bikes, which was seven-to-eight hours per day for two weeks.  The lights always worked reliably and the batteries lasted for the entire two-week tour.  I can't say enough good things about these lights and how they enhance rider safety.  Having two of them mounted to my rack was an added plus.  They absolutely generate a second look from motorists.  So in sum you have a nice, reliable product at a good price.  What's not to like?

Great Tail Light!!!
This light is bright!  I purchased this to put on a second bike.  My other bike has a Cateye LD600, which is a good light, but not nearly as intense as the Superflash.  Very happy with this.

Stupid Bright! excellent
Bought this about two years ago.  I cannot recomend it enough.  I commute most weeek-nights in Los Angeles.  It is by far the brightest light out there.  Also, i've have not had to change the battery in two years!  I keep waiting to see when I'll have to change, but it's just as ridiculously bright as ever.  If you get hit by a car with this one, you were probably hit on purpose!

Simply The Best Tail Light Available So Far. Love it!
I did a lot of research, read endless reviews, and did a lot of hands-on in stores. After all, if your bike riding entails much time sharing even suburban side streets with cars and preoccupied/oblivious/attitudinal/texting drivers, your tail light is crucial and could make the difference between a nice ride or a trip to the ER. And after lots of hands-on, the Super Flash (as many other reviews attest, here and elsewhere on the Web) is just hands-down the best tail light available(as of this point in LED development, which of course will continue to evolve in the next 2-3 years, although it will take a lot to surpass the current Super Flash).<br />I love this light. It's plastic, but build quality feels pretty good. It's easily removable, and clips securely to a jacket, strap etc. (It normally comes with a mount for a rear bike rack in addition to the standard seatpost mount, make sure the source you order from includes the rear rack mount; if not it can still be ordered seperately). It has two modes: steady on and a 1-2-3 flashing mode which is a real attention getter. Both are bright and very visible (not always the same thing). Good side visibility, which isn't always apparent in product photos, I'd say about a 140 degree field from the rear/side. VERY bright from directly behind in the same lane. I was a little concerned from other reviews if it would prove obnoxious/too blindingly bright to other riders on bike trails, and glad to say it's not. [...] I'm very pleased with this light, and bought it again for a friend. The case opens and closes easily to change batteries; I haven't had it out in any drenching downpours so can't comment on water resistance. On-off button is located on the very bottom, (not the rear) & easy to find by touch. This light is a winner. Now stop reading all these reviews, buy it, and enjoy your bright well-chosen and reasonably priced tail light.

This light is so bright, it amazes me they are using LEDs.  If you live in a high traffic area, it's the ideal light to capture the attention of those drivers entranced in a cellphone daze.  I initially purchased the black and clear 3034-1 model for my own bike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015R40JE">Planet Bike 3034-1 Blinky Superflash .5 Watt LED with 2 Red LED Tail Lights (Black/Clear Case)</a> and was left so impressed, I purchased 3 more for my wife's and kids' bikes along with the Planet Bike Blinky "3H" Helmet Light <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000793NY4">Planet Bike Blinky "3H" 3-Led Rear Bicycle Light with Self Leveling Helmet Mount</a>. These things can be seen from a good distance, even on bright, and sunny days.  At night, you could pass for a firetruck when in strobe mode.  <br /><br />Looking straight on is where the light is most intense, while at a side view, about 1/2 as much.<br /><br />Both models come with 3 mounting options - a backpack clip, a round mounting for your standard seatpost, and a smaller round mounting for when using the light on the thin tubes on your frame.  Note that if you are mounting anywhere else but the seatpost or other perfectly round post on your frame, you may have to improvise with the mount especially if you have an odd shaped or flat tubed frame. Batteries are included.<br /><br />I've been witness to too many near misses simply because drivers are not paying attention.  Decrease your chance of being involved in an accident - use safety lights day or night.  Safe travels!   <br />

They can't miss seeing me
I have almost complete faith that, if I am seen by someone coming up behind me in a car, they will make at least a minimal effort to avoid hitting me.  The trick then, is to make sure they see me.<br /><br />The flash this light puts out is hard to miss.  Unlike the blinky which just blinks a red light, this little light strobes a very bright white light and then blinks.  It is very attention getting.    It can readily be seen even in daylight.  I recommend this for anyone who finds themselves riding at night, dusk, dawn or in cloudy weather.  <br /><br />It won't save you from drunks or psychopaths though, so keep an eye out for them.

Terrifyingly bright
As everyone else has said, this thing is great. It's honestly an order of magnitude brighter than anything else out there, and the weird pattern of the two sets of LEDs makes it much more noticeable as well. You can definitely see this thing from hundreds of yards away even in full daylight.<br /><br />The only negative is you need to make sure you hear a click when sliding into the mount. It can look fully seated but vibrate out on rough roads otherwise. Once you hear the click, it stays in through anything.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Very blinky!
I cycle to work and I needed something for the dawn/dusk time period. This light is great! The LEDs are nice and bright and you can use rechargeable batteries with it. One simple button press turns it on in blinker mode, another press switches it to steady mode, and then another one turns it off. The blinker mode is a pattern that's *very* visible and calls attention to itself which is perfect.<br /><br />It comes with a number of mounts but not one that will allow you to attach it directly to a rack which is a separate, but inexpensive, purchase (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IQEAK2">Planet Bike Bicycle Tail Light Rack Bracket - 3108</a>). I use a basic clip that it came with and clip it to one of my bags although I will be picking up the mount soon.<br /><br />I recommend using rechargeable batteries and keep an extra set of alkaline with you as backups in case you suddenly need them.<br /><br />If a piece breaks, you can go to Planet Bike's website and order a replacement part. They state that in order to promote fixing something instead of throwing it away and buying a new one, they will waive the shipping fee! Awesome.

Almost makes capitalism worth it!
I'm pretty skeptical of most products and companies. If you are not being outright farmed, even the good products are not all that. But, every time I turn on this blinky, "Wow, that is f'ing great!". It is stupidly wonderful. Planet Bike already made the second best blinky, the Seven, which is really good and somewhat cheaper. They could have just improved that a little and been fine. Instead they gave us the alien technology blinky from the future.<br /><br />Seriously, this is almost perfect. Solid, good mounts, convenient, excellent battery life, good size, inexpensive if not cheap, almost too bright, very attention getting blink pattern. It is so effective that you can hear when it is on just by the sound of overtaking traffic. It would be nice  if it had a wider coverage angle to the sides and up and down, but this is difficult to do. The Planet Bike Seven has extra LEDs that point sideways to help with this, but it is nowhere near as bright (it would be a good complement to the Superflash).<br /><br />Planet bike also make the best headlight mount in the business. Unfortunately, their LED headlights fail to impress. Hopefully they will put the Superflash team on the headlights soon.<br /><br />The other blinkys are just sad. Except the DiNotte, which is sexy, bright, beautiful and well over a hundred dollars and might get stolen and make you cry.<br />

Planet Bike Blinky Super Flash
I ride my bicycle to work year round and I needed a tail light where I could easily be seen by motorists.  I considered spending a few hundred dollars on a battery powered tail light but after seeing a review here on Amazon I decided to give the blinky a try.  If the blinky did not work out I could always by the battery powered device.  I have been thrilled with my decision.  I bought two and use one on my helmet and one on my bike.  A few friends who have seen me around town have commented as to how easy it was to see me from a distance.  One friend commented that he thought I was a police car in the distance.  I suspect that some day I will break down and spend the extra money for the $200+ battery operated tail light.  But until then, I feel very safe and well seen in using the Planet Blinky.

Bright and Visible even in Daylight
I really like the brightness of the center blinking LED - it is extremely bright.  I even use it during the day time to help me be seen as I ride the city streets of San Jose.  I own two of these - one for each bike. I wouldn't be without it.  It is easy to turn on/off, and it is not likely to fall off it's bracket (like I've had other tail lights do).  You should get one too!!!

Blinding!
<br /><br />Currently, I have four bicycle taillights in my possession, including the new Cateye Opticube. The superflash is by far the brightest. Interestingly, it is also the smallest and weighs in at a diminutive 53 grams. When I first opened the box, I was actually disappointed as I expected something 2-3 times as large. Planet Bike truly hit a homerun with the Blinky Superflash. <br /><br />With the incredible brightness of the main LED, this light is visible from a distance on a sunny day at noon. I haven't seen anything like it. In addition to the sheer intensity, visibility is enhanced by an interesting flash pattern that combines two smaller LEDs to produce a Morse-code-like signal. <br /><br />As far as I can tell at this juncture, there are no design flaws with the Superflash. For my purposes, however, I would have preferred a larger clip for use on my backpack. <br /><br />Pros <br />Extremely bright <br />Small <br />Built-in reflector <br />Sturdy housing <br /><br />Cons <br />Could use a slightly larger clip for attaching to a backpack (very minor) <br />Too directional (i.e. not enough spread)

more top-notch bike gear from Planet Bike
I had to toss my otherwise serviceable Blackburn rear light when the brittle plastic mounting clip failed after about two years of use.  Determined to purchase a quality replacement, the Planet Bike brand was the obvious choice. Like the well-worn Planet Bike headlight I've been using, this model taillight is made from a durable plastic that resists cracking from normal patterns of wear, such as accompanies attaching and detaching lights from their mounts when parking bikes.  Anyone who rides a lot in the city knows that leaving lights attached to parked bikes is a bad idea.  Since the Planet Bike people are avid cyclists, their designs reflect this consideration and the result is durable mounting systems.  It is also worth mentioning that this light is extremely bright, rivaling car taillights for visibility on dark streets.  A very fine piece of gear from a company run by enthusiasts and definitely not the last item I'll buy from this company.

Second only to the DiNotte.
I have used the Superflash since it hit the market last year. Planet Bike has definitely hit a home run with this one. It's very affordable, cheaper than the much-vaunted Cateye LD-100, but it's brighter than everything but the DiNotte($150+). I use a Superflash on my seatbag, and one on the blinky strap on my Bell Metro helmet(another excellent product). Those two lights get me plenty of respect from motorists. <br /><br />If money is no object, buy the DiNotte. It's the best light available. 140 lumens of red flasher will get the job done. But using a couple of Superflashes is an excellent choice. Bright, attention getting, lightweight, affordable, and made by a company who gives money to bicycle charities. I love it.

almost blinded myself!
Just got this taillight in the mail a week or so ago and I am still amazed how bright it is!  I ride a Sun EasySport AX recumbent bike and the smaller of the 2 mounts fits perfect on the frame of the seat. It's easy to remove from the mount and clip on shirt,belt or pack.  I was using another led taillight, unsure of the brand, and it looks like a dim nightlight compared to the Super Flash.  There may be brighter taillights out there, though you'd probably have to get one of those expensive battery-hogging strobes to do it.  This is the only LED taillight I've yet seen that even mentions the word "watt".  If you've ever used a Luxeon LED flashlight, they start at I think 1 watt, well this thing seems about that bright!  Although I haven't tried it yet during daytime rides, I'm pretty sure that it will be seen then too.  Just don't look directly at it from close range.

Brightest light ever!!
This is the ONE light if you want to be seen at night. It is unbelievably bright. Don't get the one with the black back as that is an older model and no where as bright as this one. EVERYONE who sees this light gets one as it is the brightest they've ever seen!!

Great blinky, night AND day!
I bought this light after seeing it on another bike during the middle of the day... the blinding flasher was visible even in bright sunlight!  And at night, it's killer good.  Now that I've got it on my bike I run it night and day.  It's good on batteries, and even if it wasn't , who cares?  For the cost of a couple of triple A batteries this light does a great job of increasing my visibility and keeping me safe.

Look up some videos at YouTube if you don't believe how great it is. I recommment it to everyone who rides a bike. Sometimes I clip it to my backpack to make sure cars see me in the evening/night when walking at places without pavement.<br />To make sure... this is a red LED light, not a white one, it just has clear case. I also bought the one in red case (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBEH1W) and it works and looks the same (except the different color of the case). One is for my bro...<br />I'm very satisfied... 5 stars!

Just the Best
I'm a year-round, all-weather, night-and-day bike commuter.  I don't need the lightest, newest, top-grade drivetrain components or a custom titanium frame, and I'm not about to pay for them.  But good lights are one thing I do need, and I don't mind paying top dollar for the added safety.  (I have a top-of-the-line Dinotte combo for my bar/helmet lights.)<br /><br />Happily, though, I don't seem to need to shell out big money for a tail light.  I've tried various models, but this little guy is just the best.  I could pay a LOT more and get the ridiculously bright Dinotte tail light, but why?  This little Planet Bike is already insanely visible, and dirt cheap.<br /><br />I've had mine (the Stealth) out in all weather, all year, and the thing just. never. fails.  I see others have reported switch problems, but none here.  Besides, they're so cheap, just buy 2; toss one in your blowout bag and you've got a backup tail light every bit as good as your main, that clips instantly onto the same mounting hardware. Buy the non-Stealth model for your backup.  It's even cheaper.<br /><br />A couple of other nice features:<br /><br />1. It seems to be extremely easy on batteries.  After several months, I finally changed mine out just because I thought surely they must be getting low.<br /><br />2. The Stealth model really is virtually invisible when it's not blinkifying.  Mine's mounted on one of my seat stays, and if you're not looking for it, you just don't see it.<br /><br />In short, I love this thing.  It's one of those extremely rare consumer products that does exactly what it should do, does it extremely well, and costs what it ought to: it's the Craftsman wrench of bicycle lights.

Amazing Device Straight out of Star Trek
Purchased this because of the great reviews online.  It is super compact and SUPER BRIGHT!  If you strapped a couple of these on the roof of your car people would pull over.  The only better way to be seen on a bike would be to set yourself on fire!  Great product with an amazing price.

If you need a rear bicycle light, look no farther
I read the very positive reviews on Amazon before deciding to try the Planet Blinky Super Flash.  I have several LED flashlights and I knew the 1/2 watt LED would be bright, but you have to see this to believe it.  It is small and light and easy to install with several mounting options. I ride 4 times a week on public roads so I use this exclusively during the day on flashing mode.  I don't think it is my imagination but cars give me a wider berth than before installing this light.  My wife said she could see my flashing light over a mile ahead on a bright Arizona day.  If you want to be really seen, then this is the only rear bicycle light to buy.  I've had it for over two months and I'm still on the same batteries that came with the unit!

Great Little Light!
I bought two Planet Bike Superflashes for a recent bicycle tour of Coastal Oregon and Northern California.  My intent was to mount them to the flat light bracket on my Tubus rear rack, but there were no provision on the Superflashes for mounting to a flat surface...  What to do?  After trying several options I cut an old inner tube to the length of the mounting plate, split that section of inner tube, and then slipped it over the mounting plate.  This worked something like an elastic waste band and the two Superflashes clipped easily and securely to the rubber-covered light mount.  I checked the configuration a couple of times during the tour and it held up well; no adjustments required.  The superflashes worked superbly during the tour.  We cycled during conditions that ranged from rainy, to foggy, to low light (under canopies of Redwoods), to sunny and the superflashes were always on while we were on the bikes, which was seven-to-eight hours per day for two weeks.  The lights always worked reliably and the batteries lasted for the entire two-week tour.  I can't say enough good things about these lights and how they enhance rider safety.  Having two of them mounted to my rack was an added plus.  They absolutely generate a second look from motorists.  So in sum you have a nice, reliable product at a good price.  What's not to like?

Great Tail Light!!!
This light is bright!  I purchased this to put on a second bike.  My other bike has a Cateye LD600, which is a good light, but not nearly as intense as the Superflash.  Very happy with this.

Stupid Bright! excellent
Bought this about two years ago.  I cannot recomend it enough.  I commute most weeek-nights in Los Angeles.  It is by far the brightest light out there.  Also, i've have not had to change the battery in two years!  I keep waiting to see when I'll have to change, but it's just as ridiculously bright as ever.  If you get hit by a car with this one, you were probably hit on purpose!

Simply The Best Tail Light Available So Far. Love it!
I did a lot of research, read endless reviews, and did a lot of hands-on in stores. After all, if your bike riding entails much time sharing even suburban side streets with cars and preoccupied/oblivious/attitudinal/texting drivers, your tail light is crucial and could make the difference between a nice ride or a trip to the ER. And after lots of hands-on, the Super Flash (as many other reviews attest, here and elsewhere on the Web) is just hands-down the best tail light available(as of this point in LED development, which of course will continue to evolve in the next 2-3 years, although it will take a lot to surpass the current Super Flash).<br />I love this light. It's plastic, but build quality feels pretty good. It's easily removable, and clips securely to a jacket, strap etc. (It normally comes with a mount for a rear bike rack in addition to the standard seatpost mount, make sure the source you order from includes the rear rack mount; if not it can still be ordered seperately). It has two modes: steady on and a 1-2-3 flashing mode which is a real attention getter. Both are bright and very visible (not always the same thing). Good side visibility, which isn't always apparent in product photos, I'd say about a 140 degree field from the rear/side. VERY bright from directly behind in the same lane. I was a little concerned from other reviews if it would prove obnoxious/too blindingly bright to other riders on bike trails, and glad to say it's not. [...] I'm very pleased with this light, and bought it again for a friend. The case opens and closes easily to change batteries; I haven't had it out in any drenching downpours so can't comment on water resistance. On-off button is located on the very bottom, (not the rear) & easy to find by touch. This light is a winner. Now stop reading all these reviews, buy it, and enjoy your bright well-chosen and reasonably priced tail light.

Finally a cage that fits 750ml CamelBak Bottles!
I love CamelBak's medium-sized 750ml bottles, but this is the only cage I've found that will hold them.  It adjusts easily to fit a wide range of wide and narrow bottles.  Topeak came up with a clever idea and implemented it brilliantly.  This cage is simple, practical, and effective.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Simple, solid, reasonably priced.
I installed this on my bike in about 30 seconds.  I like the feel of it and the fact that it adjusts easily with the turn of a screw (by hand).  I think a cage that adjusts to bottle size with a spring, i.e. where you can pull back the outer part of the cage and let close on the bottle, would make more sense (it be faster and easier to use on the go than a screw) but 'it is what it is.'

Great!
Great water bottle cage.  It adjusts to allow bigger bottles by a little knob on the bottom you can turn looser or tighten for smaller bottles. Easy to install, all you need is the two little screws that screw onto the frame of the bike.  It doesn't come with the screws though but most bikes have them already.  If all you have are two holes there, then you'll have to find/buy the correct screws to install.  Hope this helps future purchasers!

Great bottle cage
I spent a lot of time looking for a bottle cage that would accept a coffee container as well as a water bottle.  This was the only one I found that was easily adjustable by turning a set screw.  I also purchased the Nissan hot/cold thermos container that allows me to carry either cold or hot contents and it fits perfectly in this bottle cage.  This Modula waterbottle cage is well made and looks professional but is not as durable as the beefier wire type cages.  I'm very pleased with it.  Although some comments have indicated that a standard plastic water bottle "rattles around" in the holder, the store bought smaller water bottle does not fall out unless you're on a rough trail, however in that case, it would seem prudent for you to use a pull/push valve water container made for that purpose, or buy the larger size of store bought water bottle that fits tighter.

This water bottle cage from Topeak is an excellent value.  It is adjustable for different bottle sizes and it appears to be very durable.  Also, installation was a breeze.

multi-use holder
As others have mentioned, this holder is adjustable.  Because of this, it lends itself to carry item other than water bottles.  I sometimes use it to carry bottle of wine to friends' for dinner (nice and secure).  The plastic backing also keeps the wine bottle from hitting the frame.<br /><br />Another favorite use is to carry a sub from my favorite local deli (Bay Cities Italian Deli).  I wouldn't think of using a normal bottle cage to do this lest it crushes my meatball or prosciutto subs.<br /><br />At the smallest setting, it carries a normal sports/water bottle just fine although small 10 or 12oz bottled waters will rattle.<br /><br />For $4 plus free shipping, this simply can't be beat.

Works well with my Stainless Steel Water Bottle
I bought this cage to hold a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EGIKDS">Thermos 18-Ounce Stainless Steel Hydration Bottle, Charcoal</a> It mounts and adjusts easily and it is easy to get my bottle in and out without a lot of looking at it/slowing down. The only thing I can say that even approaches a negative about this cage is that it does slightly mar the surface of the brushed aluminum on the bottle - not scratch it, but you will be able to see where it contacted the bottle as you take it out and put it back in. It is very slight, and seems to mostly disappear when I rub the bottle, but it would not be fair to not mention it. It is also only fair to mention that Topeak makes an all-Nylon cage that I could have chosen if keeping my bottle in pristine appearance was all important. It wasn't, I didn't, and I am very happy with my choice.

Nice one-size-fits-all cage... nice design
I often buy sports drinks from the many vending machines on the streets around Tokyo.  The size of these bottles varies, so it is nice to have a holder that can be adjusted to fit anything from a small bottle, up to a 750 ml bottle.  Easy to install and easy to adjust the size by simply turning the screw at the bottom of the holder.  No tools needed to adjust size.

Sleek, yet very functional
This is a good looking, light weight water bottle cage. It has the composite material appropiately placed, while using steel where strength is paramount/critical.  The bottle size adjustment screw is a very smart feature, easy to use and intuitive. Should be able to accommodate any typical water bottle design.

Water Bottle Cage
This is a really good product, sturdy, locks and aligns in place on the bike, holds a full size water bottle over jumps and long rides without faulter. Good value.

Adaptable
Very sturdy and adaptable bottle holder, though I mainly use it to hold my coffee mug which just barely fits in there nice and snuggly.  I like the how well made it is, it seems to be very durable.

Best cage I have used.
I use three different sizes and types of bottles, depending upon the trip and weather.  This is the first cage I have found that can be used with all three.  It is well designed, simple, and effective.  Great product.

Holds my 20oz. Wal-Mart bottle of water!
Great water bottle holder for the money. It's adjustable, and with the adjustment screw all the way out, I have room for a 20oz. bottle of Wal-Mart water with a little room to spare. It fits my Motobecane Elite bicycle perfectly. Highly recommended!

Klean Kanteen compared to Sigg
Last month I bought a 40oz Klean Kanteen bottle and a 33oz Sigg bottle. In the end I prefer the Klean Kanteen.<br /><br />Both bottles are very light and look good. The Sigg is lighter, but not so much to really matter. Sigg wins easily in the looks department with different artwork to choose from and the bottle I have has a nice textured powder coat finish compared to the KK basic look and smooth surface.<br /><br />Sigg uses an epoxy to protect your water from the aluminum and tells you not to use the bottle for long term storage. Could be a bit worrisome not knowing what's in the epoxy and the possibility of aluminum contamination. I have not noticed a metallic taste from either bottle drinking straight unfiltered tap water. I prefer the stainless steel of the KK just because it's probably on the safer side.<br /><br />The bottles are both lightweight and made of thin metal. I haven't dented either but I have been very careful with them. Both feel like they would dent quite easily. I have not scratched either bottle and the paint on both looks like new after daily use from work to the gym.<br /><br />The KK bottle has the cap threading formed into the neck of the bottle while the Sigg uses a metal ring insert in the top of the bottle to thread the cap onto. Some people have complained that the Sigg's threaded insert is sharp, but I have not had this problem. The KK is more comfortable to drink from though. Also the wide mouth of the bottle makes it easy to put ice cubes in, which you can't do with the Sigg unless you have very small ice cubes.<br /><br />I have the loop cap on both bottles. The Sigg I really have to twist the cap on tight so it doesn't leak. The KK cap seals quite easily and has never leaked. The KK also uses a thicker thread size and is easier to screw the cap onto because of this.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about sweating. On a hot day with the bottles filled with ice cubes both will sweat, but plastic bottles will also.<br /><br />If I was going to spend that much money on a water bottle again, I would go with Klean Kanteen without a second thought. The only advantage of the Siggs is the exterior design.<br /><br />Update Dec 09: Over a year of use now and I have stopped using the Sigg due to their older bottles do in fact have BPA. Something they said it didn't have, so I won't buy another bottle from them again since it appears they were lying before. They will replace the older bottles, but you have to pay shipping.<br /><br />I have 2 Klean Kanteens and both have held up well. Some minor scratches and dents, but still look quite good.

excellent SS water bottle
This is an excellent stainless steel bottle which both my husband and I use daily.  I bought the orange one; he uses the regular stainless steel.  We used to buy tons of the plastic water bottles, drinking several a day, but wanted to cut down on our use of plastics.  These water bottles work well in conjunction with my water filter system and the taste is clean and fresh tasting.  Highly recommend them and this is a very usable size.

Great Waterbottles
We have 8 of these bottles.  Two for Mom and Dad...two for our kids ages 2 and 4.  They are indestructable, you can scrub the insides and not worry of scratching and they do not leach anything into your beverage.

Love it!
I LOVE this water bottle.  It can go in the dish washer, it keeps water a little cooler, and it's pretty.  My 2 year old daughter and I both have pink.  Mine has a little dent but who cares?  Best of all, it's eco-friendly and it has a wide mouth that fits ice cubes.  The Sigg water bottles have a small opening and do not fit ice cubes.  Buy this bottle for everyone in your family and quit putting plastic bottles in the landfills!

No BPA...
I have several Klean Kanteen water bottles and love them...the different sizes are great for kids to adults and they go everywhere with no after taste, no BPA or chemicals leaching into your drink, and no  retained smells even after putting Koolaid in them! The one down side that they have is that they dent easily if dropped - learned the hard way - now being more careful.

Beware of the Flashy Aluminum Bottles
Need a bottle of water with you all the time? Has all the news about BPA leaching into your water from plastic water bottles got you paranoid? Feel like you need to do your part to save the Earth by not buying bottled water?  Klean Kanteen has got you covered! <br /><br />Personally, I have the 27 ounce model with both the loop cap and a sports cap (Klean Kanteen Sports Cap). The loop cap is great for everyday use i.e., around the office, and the I use the sport cap at the gym and when I go biking (the 27 ounce bottle fits into standard water bottle cages on bikes).<br /><br />If you are a BPA-phobe, like me, beware of aluminum water bottles (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RI4ES4">Sigg Lifestyle Loop Top Water Bottle (1.0-Liters)</a>) which use a coating/liner that may or may contain BPA.  Stick with stainless steel.  You can't go wrong with a Klean Kanteen. I have already converted/scared/guilted a few people at my office from plastic bottles to Klean Kanteens and they are all happy with the switch.

Nice Bottle
Ordered and was delivered within 3 days. Very sturdy bottle and not too big (27oz). I did get the sports top and it works great (be sure not to screw it on too tight so if flows easily). We have 3 of them and none of us have noticed any bad smell or taste. I did fill it up and let it sit over night and still did not notice any different taste. Glad to get rid of those plastic bottles. Great product.

Klean Kanteen
Our college daughter wanted an "eco friendly water bottle" because they are the "in" thing on campus.  However, when I saw the price, I thought I needed to investigate a little further.  After doing a lot of online research as to which brand rated the highest, we went with Klean Kanteen because they are PBA free and had a good color selection.  Then I began to add up how many cases of bottled water I buy each money for our family and when I factored in the fact that those plastic water bottles are terrible for the environment (700 years to decompose), I ordered one for each member of our family!  They will have paid for themselves in four months since we no longer buy bottled water.  Another benefit is that we now carry them everywhere (they fit into the cup holders and we can loop them to briefcases and/or bookbags), so we are drinking more water than ever!  To clean them, I soak them overnight in hot soapy water and then just rinse them in the morning.  I highly recommend one for each member of your family.  If you have kids in school, I would suggest that you etch their initials into the bottom as they are becoming more popular and I did not want my high school daughter's to "disappear".

The orange, is NOT orange
I love these bottles, and I really love that they come in colors now!<br /><br />But, sunset orange, is not orange.  It's kinda rust colored.  Still nice though. <br /><br />I was surprised to find that I prefer the  new plastic caps over the metal ones.  I am going to order a few plastic flat top caps to use instead of the metal ones.

No Problems
Just received the Klean Kanteen shoulder sling for $5.50 w/ free 2 day shipping. Despite many negative reviews, I figured how bad could it be for the money? It came in the same box as the Klean Kanteen 27 ounce bottle I had also ordered, and both were in protective poly bags. With trepidation I started the alleged horrific process of placing the bottle in the sling. I don't know what is different about the sling I got, but after carefully lining it up with the bottom of the bottle, I simply pulled evenly on the straps and it slipped right over the bottle! It is a snug fit, but that is good. It won't slip out on the trail, and since it is hanging at your side, you don't need to take it out of the sling to drink, just unscrew the cap and go for it. The cap threads on easily,and has a soft(neoprene?) gasket to insure a good seal. The bottle is sturdy yet light, and with a very attractive finish(I chose the black), and the best thing is no more crappy plastic taste! Both the bottle and the sling are five stars as far as I am concerned, and I am going to order another bottle and sling in the 40 ounce size.

I like this since it makes carrying the larger bottle easier, I found it is a little difficult to put on and take off though.. When you order make sure it says it is in stock.

Nice accessory for Klean Kanteen bottle
I recently became interested in stainless steel water bottles for purely pragmatic reasons. After determining the 40 oz. Klean Kanteen appeared to meet my needs, I investigated the various options. The sling holders made specifically to fit the bottle was a welcome option to allow hauling the bottle around with me. Until recently I've carried re-used water bottles until they became worn from the constant use. I was a bit concerned about the fit of the sling based on some of the reviews I'd read, but I found it took me only about 30 seconds to slide the sling onto the Kanteen (no directions needed). The adjustable strap is handy to allow me to change the length as I may need. Since I initially made the strap relatively short, there was a foot or so of strap that needed to be dealt with. I just folded it up in an accordion fashion and wrapped a couple rubber bands around it.Everything fits well and the strap allows me to hang on to the bottle along with a computer bag, portfolio and whatever else I may be hauling from one meeting to another. I'm sure if I think enough I can come up with some negatives about the sling, but for the price and functionality it provides, I'm quite happy with the product.

Works good for me
This stap works well for me.  I lost my first one in a move and missed it so I bought it again.  It fits to the bottle really tight and the strap size is great.  I use it when I go hiking or on long jogs.

Love this, bought a second one as back up!
I love this sling. It works great. I love stainless steel bottles but I like to rinse them in hot water between uses and stainless steel is a great conductor and it would burn my hand but this sling is just thick enough to protect my hand from the heat while holding it.  It also keeps my hand from freezing when I fill it up with ice cubes and water. Many people probably buy stainless steel bottles but get turned off by freezing hands...I think all stainless steel bottles should come with a sling like this or some type of sleeve.  I put this sling over my shoulder when walking so I can drink easily without slowing down--so much easier than having to un-clip a bottle from a belt loop.  It was a tight fit but I didn't have trouble getting it on, once I got it on, I don't take it off very often--there's no need to since I don't put it in the dishwasher. Great price too.

may be costly sounding but figured in 10 years I'll still be using it so it was worth the cost--much easier to tote the companion ss water bottle when it's over your shoulder.

Works great
I purchased this for the new Kanteen water bottles I bought (3 of them), and it works great. Allows me more freedom without having to stick the bottle in my purse. BTW, the water bottle itself is also great. I'm now planning on buying more of them.

Canteen Shoulder Sling
The sling is useful if you don't have a pack, but gets in the way if you do have a pack. So if you're going on a really short hike without anything else or just a walk around town, this item is definitely a recommendation. If not, skip it and just stick it in a compartment of your backpack. <br /><br />Pros: <br /><br />Lightweight <br />Strong Build <br />Secure Hold <br /><br />Cons: <br /><br />None

a better way to carry your water
With all the new worries about re-usable plastics and the environmental issues of disposable water bottles, we have opted to go with stainless steel.  We have loved them so far and look forward to years of use.

Simple, and great!
I bought one for me and one for my wife for our Klean Kanteens that we got from the company I work for. We take daily walks and each carried around a CamelBak water bottle, but had nothing to carry it on so we had to hold them by hand.<br /><br />When we got the Klean Kanteens, I immediately went looking for accessories so that we could take these with us instead, and found this great sling. It took a little work to get the sling started on the bottle, but it wasn't terribly difficult. I'd consider this to be a feature more than a detriment, since it makes sure that your Kanteens are secure and definitely won't go anywhere.<br /><br />The sling seems well made and is definitely tough. It wasn't hard to get the sling around the Kanteen at all, despite what I've read on other reviews. My guess is that they purchased the wrong sling for the size of their Kanteen, so make sure to check how many ounces yours is before buying this one.

Water Bottle Shoulder Sling
This product is great for cycling.  I don't have one of those bottle holders attached to my bike, so this sling is great... LOVE IT!

Great product!
The sling is great.  Glad I bought it.  I bought it to use while hiking and it is great for that purpose.  Just sling it over your shoulder and start hiking, it stays out of the way but very accessible.  The bonus use is that when my bottle is in my car it kind of rolls around while driving.  By leaving the strap on all the time my Klean Kanteen bottle rolls much less and is easier to grab when it does - just reach for the strap! The strap can be a touch difficult to put on the bottle but not enough to not buy it.

Snug fit, but makes it easy to carry
The sleeve fits a bit tight on the bottle, which can make it hard to get on and off sometimes, but once it's on you know it is secure. It makes it very easy to take the water bottle on walks, etc.

Klean Kanteen Klean Deal
I ordered the Klean Kanteen 27 oz bottle after reading all the horrors of plastic.  I buy my water in bulk (I do not use municipal water nor do I buy "drinking" water with all the chlorine in it) so need a container to put it in.  I like the product. I also liked the support I received the minute I ordered it. The company send an email and then kept me posted as to the delivery of the product.  They even followed up after delivery.  I would definitely order from them again.  Good job.

Stainless steel is best
Every thing about this 40-ounce bottle is great!. but for one thing....<br />When you walk around with it it bounces around and would be better if it had another strap to go around you to keep it steady. Other then that. It's Aces.............

A Worthy Successor to the Roomba Line
We have two Roombas plus a Scooba in our house. When one of the batteries on one of our Roombas finally reached the end of its life cycle, we decided to donate that Roomba to a friend and to get ourselves the new top of the line - the Roomba 560. We got this right when it first came out, but we waited several months before posting a review. It's pretty much impossible to review one of these Roombas after only a few days! It takes weeks if not months to start to see how well they last over time, and what breaks down. Believe me - been there, done that.<br /><br />So now it's many months later, and I have to say, we are quite pleased with the improvements of this Roomba over the previous generations of Roombas. So first, for those who don't even have ANY Roomba yet (hard to believe!). Roombas are awesome. We have cats, and we work from home so we're home all day. It is AMAZING how much dirt and dust and junk collects in the carpet every single day. Who really has time to vacuum their carpets twice a day any more? With the Roomba, you set the scheduler to do it while you are asleep. You wake up in the morning, the carpets are clean, the air is fresh, and you empty out the dust bin. It is just wonderful.<br /><br />Even those without pets might be amazed how much lint and such the Roomba will find every morning for you.<br /><br />I have a noise meter and have done several tests with the noise meter. The Roomba is much quieter than other regular vacuums. It is NOT silent - it can't be! How could it vacuum up dirt and be silent? But it is quieter than the alternatives, and heck, you're sleeping anyway. I can easily sleep through a Roomba running.<br /><br />Now, on to the improvements of this new Roomba over previous models. First, it has a cool feature where the speed drops when it senses it is approaching a solid object. The old Roomba would just run full tilt into an object - wall, couch etc. - and then turn around. This one slows down so that it hits the object gently. Sure the old Roomba wouldn't dent the walls with its powerful force, but still, it's nice to have it be gentle on furniture and your building.<br /><br />Next, for better or for worse, the new Roomba is much more aware of when its bin and brushes are getting grungy. I admit I didn't clean my other Roombas as often as I should have. And it led to problems. This new Roomba will actually stop and warn you when it's getting full and when the brushes should be cleaned. If you're a procrastinator like I am, this is a good thing. If you're a clean freak that empties the bin every time, and cleans the brushes every time, then you probably won't even notice this feature.<br /><br />The anti tangle technology is nice. The previous Roomba would start to eat a cord and just keep going until it was really stuck. This Roomba at least tries to get itself untangled. Still, I don't recommend leaving cords and strings and things lying around. You're just asking for trouble if you do.<br /><br />The new system uses a "lighthouse" instead of just a wall. With a lighthouse, you mark out a room so the Roomba finishes with that room completely before going on to the next room. They are like section markers. We tend to just use walls, but if you have two large rooms the lighthouse feature might be really helpful for you.<br /><br />After several months of running we have had NO problems at all with our Roomba. No broken brushes, no falling off pieces, nothing. It is still going strong and we are very pleased with it.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended! I am happy to give personal advice and I even have videos of Roombas on my website. I love Roombas, they have saved me countless hours of work, and they make my home a much cleaner and easier-breathing place to be.

Scratch Vacuuming Off Your List! (Almost)
Did you ever just fall in love . . . with a piece of well-designed technology?  I sure fell for this one. How lovely to have something else take care of one of my least favorite chores!<br /><br />Why I love this gizmo:<br /><br />     (1) Goes about cleaning the floors quietly (forget the noise of a conventional vacuum cleaner);<br /><br />     (2) Does a better job than I ever could because it can get  under the beds fully to get out all the nasty little dust bunnies, and it crawls along the baseboard to pick up the bits that hide on the edges of the room;<br /><br />     (3) Cleans for a predetermined amount of time, and then puts itself to bed (while it recharges itself);<br /><br />     (4) Can be scheduled to run whenever you choose; and,<br /><br />     (5) Does a great job of picking up cat hair (my old vacuum did not).<br /><br />Problems?  <br /><br />Yes, but mostly they were just getting used to its operation.  I had to learn to pick up throw rugs and clear the area of cords.  I had to learn the robot's eccentricities and plan for them.  <br /><br />I also discovered that a cat landing on the Roomba in the middle of the night would start it going - so we woke up to clean floors.<br /><br />Worth it?<br /><br />You bet!<br /><br />Five stars, and a big thanks! <br /><br />UPDATE:  October 4, 2007<br /><br />My Roomba produced an error message that I was unable to clear.  So I called (not emailed, but called) the support center.  The Roomba needed to be reset, and, with the help of the support person, I accomplished this and we're back in action.<br /><br />The support was superior, so if you have a problem, just give them a call.  If your call is like mine, you'll find them highly responsive and eager to help solve your problem.<br /><br />UPDATE:  November 30, 2007<br /><br />About four weeks after my initial review, the side brush fell off.  The part that holds the brush screw was broken.<br /><br />I called the company who said they'd send out another part in five days or so.  That was followed by an email that said a month.  Now it is six weeks later . . . still no replacement part.<br /><br />While the vacuum still works, the baseboard cleaning is absent without the side brush.  And I am in the dark as to when I will receive a replacement.  This would cause me to reduce the number of stars I give the Roomba 560, if Amazon would allow me to do so.<br /><br />I still think this is a good product.  It still does an adequate job of cleaning up cat hair and other debris.  But, I think the price is too high given the quality of that brush.<br /><br />In my book, iRobot has some 'splaining, and apologizing, to do.<br /><br />UPDATE: Augst 1, 2008<br /><br />Now my roomba has developed horrible screaming noises that might be coming from the wheels, but who knows.  And I now have the replacement gizmo for the side brush (after 9 months). <br /><br />I am sorry that I cannot adjust the stars on this review.  If I could I would now rate this product one star (can't give zero).  I strongly recommend not buying a Roomba!<br />

Coolest thing ever...
I bought this vacuum three weeks ago. I have only had to break out the big vacuum once in that time. With three dogs in the house, vacuuming was a daily necessity. Programing the 560 took less than a minute. It runs at night while we sleep and cleans three large rooms. Once room is tile with three large wool area rugs and lots of furniture. It gets under the tables and around bar stools with no problems. The light houses keep it in one room for about 35-40 minutes then move it on to the next. The other rooms are hardwood with several area rugs. The Roomba easily climbs over the rugs and gets the dirt. We used to find hair balls daily with a husky in the house. No more... <br /><br />I have to admit that I was a skeptic when it came to these products. Now I am completely sold on them. A second unit upstairs keeps all the carpets free of hair. I can't think of a better gift for parents or newly weds.

Exceeded expectations  in a BIG way!
I'd been looking at Roombas at different times over the years, and with this newest (latest, greatest) version, I decided to give it a shot. Well, it performs much, much better than I could have imagined. I genuinely assumed it would miss areas and not be able to really get dirt out of corners (I mean, how could it really get to everything, right?), but I was wrong. It cleans my wooden floors so well that when I saw a spec on the ground after it was done (I can't help but inspect closely), I found the spec was actually a small paint splatter that dried to the floor long ago. It really, really gets everything! Then when it's done, emptying it and cleaning out its brushes are ridiculously easy -- and I'm obviously pretty lazy, since I bought a Roomba.<br /><br />I've been using this 2-3 times a week in between when the person who cleans my house does the whole place. We have two cats, and my biggest concern is the high traffic areas of the living room, long (and relatively narrow) foyer, and the entrance to my dining room. Those three areas are connected, but of vastly different shapes and sizes. I didn't want to have to set them up to clean separately, so I decided to see if Roomba could manage the connected, but not traditionally "continuous" areas. It worked brilliantly right from the start. I keep expecting it to get lost when it is in the corner of my dining room or at the other end of the foyer, but it doesn't. It goes over and over every part of each room/section until all is clean. <br /><br />I've never used a Roomba before, so I don't know how this new one compares to the older models, but I can say that one my concerns was about cords. I'd heard complaints with earlier models, but it was supposed to be improved with this one. Well, it's totally fine. I don't want to have to put cords up all over, and for the most part I don't. There is one very thin phone cord that I get nervous about so I put it up, but otherwise, it handles all the other cords without incident. It does not navigate small throw rugs as well as I'd hoped (they tend to get bunched up), so I move those out of the way. But it handles large area rugs well, cleaning both the carpet and the hardwood floors around it.<br /><br />I see that another model comes with a remote control, but I have no idea why you'd need one. The whole point of the machine is to let it do its thing -- I don't want to move it around by remote control myself. And I have not once had the need to do so. <br /><br />If you've been on the fence and can afford it, I'd go for it. I'm really-really happy that I did.<br />

New 560 is Just Amazing!
I am a single dad and a very busy teacher.  My desire and ability to do housework is limited.  So I decided that I would finally purchase a Roomba to help keep my house cleaner.  <br /><br />Well I just used my new Roomba 560 for the first time today.  So far it has vacuumed the kitchen and an adjoining pantry, as well as the laundry room.  I didn't have batteries on hand for the vertual wall/lighthouse units, so I blocked the doorways with heavy objects on hand.  The little guy went right to work.  It was truley facinating to watch it clean.  Every time I was convinced that it would miss a little crumb, it would end up going over that spot and sucking it up.  <br /><br />It did grab a very thin cord to a phone charger, so I had to put it up.  So I think that it will take a little time to "Rooma Ready" the house.  Because I am a bit of a slob, I also tend to leave larger pieces of paper/junk on the floor. After a few minutes of watching it work, I knew that these would need to be picked up before setting it loose.  The obvious thing is that less clutter in the room to be cleaned is better.  But it sure did a very thorogh job in the areas that were cleaned.  <br /><br />Additonal Thoughts<br />I may end up buying 2 or 3 more docking units, so I can take the Roomba around the house without having to lug the docking unit with it.  I will be very interested to see if the lighthouses work. When you empty it for the first time, do so over a garbage can.  I made the mistake of pulling the dust bin out and stuff fell out all over the place on the floor I just cleaned. Finally, the brushes were easy to clean, just make sure you align the square nipple in the right receptical.<br /><br />I've only had it for a day, but so far it does everything advertised.  My co-worker has a 560 and she has used it 3-4 times a week for the last two months.  It hasn't had a problem yet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  But I will post again in a few weeks and update.<br />

So far, this thing works like a DOG!
Granted, I've had this thing for less than a week, but I can't quit raving about it.<br /><br />I got the Dirt Dog for my enclosed patio, which is home to 12 messy caged parakeets and is also, of course, where my 4 cats like to hang out.  I chose the Dirt Dog over the Roomba because I thought the sweeper would work better on the unfinished concrete than a vacuum unit, and it was cheaper.  I liked the idea of the larger crud-holder than the vacuum, and I thought maybe it would be less tempramental, too.<br /><br />The first time I turned it on, it wandered around exploring---I quickly learned that the fringed cotton rugs would have to go (no biggie, they just trap dirt anyway).  I didn't move a lot of furniture---wanted to see how it would get along without much prep work on my part.<br /><br />It quickly became my "Little Buddy" as it got stuck, or wrapped a string around its brushes and gently whimpered "Uh-Oh".  I responded like the silly thing was one of my kids: "What's up, Little Buddy?  Did you get caught on something?"  Pathetic.<br /><br />Anyway, he soon seemed to "learn" how to handle the edge of the platform my desk chair sits on and scoot under the shelves where the birds drop seeds & feathers.  I learned to put barriers up so he couldn't get into trouble on the indoor-outdoor carpet that trends to unravel.  We trained each other.<br /><br />He's noisy...but I got used to it.  The floor was looking better!<br /><br />The cats seemed fascinated, but not afraid---they didn't freak out, just watched and stayed out of the way.  At one point one of them actually sat on the floor and watched while he worked all around her.<br /><br />By the time he finished, I was thrilled with my utterly brilliant purchase.  I pulled out the hepa DustBuster http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJL18LOJDRWI/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm and sucked up what little was missed or out of his range.  Walking on the floor in my bare feet, I could feel how clean it really was---as clean as it gets when I spend half a day working on it with the big Shop Vac!<br /><br />Next test:  The bachelor son's house, equipped with three shedding dogs.  Buddy whipped back and forth under two couches and a chair, scooping up fuzzballs like a champ.  He cleaned the tile, the wood, and the (unfringed) area rug.  He wanted to do the bedroom carpet, but I was afraid that might be just TOO much, even for him.<br /><br />Buddy's next challenge was our garage---smooth concrete, but VERY UNclean.  This is what he's built for, right?  We set a timer and checked up on him about every 10 minutes to make sure he hadn't gotten stuck somewhere or pulled something into his brushes that made him stop.  It took him a while, and I could tell by his yellow light that he was getting really tired, but he got it CLEAN.  I emptied out his "dustpan" about 5 times.  Yesterday I did some spray-painting in the garage, and the whole newly-clean floor was soon covered with overspray.  So I put Buddy back to work.  He swept up all the fine paint dust off the floor---no whining, no dust mask, no beer break.  And now all that dust isn't getting tracked into the house.  I can hardly wait to turn him loose the next time there are tiny metal shavings all over the floor from some drill-press project...<br /><br />TBD is how well he'll last, but can you tell I'm pretty pleased with our newest family member?<br /><br />Update June 23 2007:<br /><br />It's now been six months, and we're on our second "Little Buddy".  After a few weeks, Buddy I began just wandering around in a circle; it turned out he had an incurable wheel issue.  It IS annoying that IRobot won't cover postage on a warranty return, but it was worth the hassle to get a new Little Buddy.  The house just wasn't the same without him.....<br /><br />Buddy II seems to be an even better and more energetic unit than his late, lamented sibling.  He has earned the weekly task of sweeping our outdoor concrete courtyard.  He gets a little rambunctious launching himself at some of the potted plants from time to time, but he does a wonderful job of cleaning up dirt, dust and leaves.  It still amazes me how much stuff he picks up from what appears to be a pretty clean surface.<br /><br />Buddy II has also been called into service for the above-mentioned drill press project.  The scene begins as I step barefoot into the garage.  I return hissing, swearing and bleeding on the floor.  As I head for the tweezer drawer, I snarl to my husband, "Get Buddy!  You've been drilling metal again and haven't cleaned up!"  So Buddy has now succesfully taken on the role of marriage counselor.<br /><br />He's also been on a couple of sleepovers at friends' houses, where he delighted his hostesses by cleaning their patios, decks and garages.  One friend was so impressed she asked for her own Buddy as a birthday gift.  He was apparently VERY well-behaved, even without parental supervision.<br /><br />Buddy continues to work tirelessly, asking for nothing but a charged battery, a clean brush and an occasional (chaperoned) date with the air-compressor.

Surpassed my expectations
I honestly thought this would not be effective at all.  I have (had actually) a very dirty smooth garage floor with all kinds of shelves etc. under which I was almost afraid to look.  Unleashing the DOG, it filled up with crud quickly, and I emptied several loads per cycle.  The DOG kicked up very little dust, and after a few runs the floor looked almost new.  There's no vacuum, it's just brooms guiding the stuff into the collection tray.  To get this level of clean without moving cars etc out of the way is impressive.  Given my low expectations, I was compelled to give a good review to my new friend.

Not Just For Workshops
I bought this Dirt Dog for my husband to use in his carpentry shop, but I couldn't resist trying it out in the house, too. I love it! It navigates easily over carpet edges, it picks up crumbs from the kitchen, it slides beneath the bed to clean there and then finds its way back out again, and it gets cat hair out of the carpets as well as or better than my Electrolux vacuum.<br /><br />When we put it in the workshop, my husband was skeptical of its ability to sweep up fine sawdust, but the Dirt Dog handled the sawdust like a champ. It has a powerful little motor, too: when it got stuck under a heavy wheeled trunk, it actually started pulling the trunk along with it.  <br /><br />On the negative side of using it for the house, it can get tangled in carpet fringe. Also it's bagless, which some people may not like. (Personally, I consider baglessness an advantage because it means I can glance into the bin to make sure it didn't sweep up an earring or something.) It won't eliminate the need for an occasional vacuuming to get the deep-down dirt out of your carpets. And although it's fairly thorough, it's slow. If the floor is dirty and you just remembered that company is arriving in ten minutes, you'll need to reach for the broom instead of the Dirt Dog. The Dirt Dog cleans well, but it takes a LOT longer to sweep a room than you would. But for day-to-day maintenance, it's great to know that the floors are being taken care of while I'm doing something else. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.

Dirt Dog is my friend!
I love dirt dog!  I have 3 I-Robots now.  Love 'em all.  They are running as I write.  I have two labs that shed a pound a hair a day, it is just laughable.  I started with a Roomba Scheduler (I baby it and keep it clean after every use) and have now added dirt dog to our pack(a lot less parts to clean than Roomba.)  I then set Scooba to finish the details.  My life is so much easier.<br /><br />Some complain of the noise, but I can at least talk on the phone or to another person when they are running.  Try doing that over a traditional vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />I do have to make sure my floors are cord free.  We have streamed floors from cords to make these awesome robaot work for us.<br /><br />I use compressed air and blow them out after everyuse, because they do pick up an amazing amount of dirt and hair.  I want these robot to hang around for a long time.  I've had my Roomba since since 2006.  I've only had to buy a new battery for old Roomba once.  I've also, unscrewed my Roomba and Dirt Dog to give them a deep through cleaning too.<br /><br />All of this versus me sweeping everyday...I will never be without one.<br /><br />

Works like a charm
We bought the dirt dog for our patio which is very large. The dirt dog sweeps up leaves and dirt and anything else that blows or falls onto our patio.  We are very happy with our dirt dog.

Good job, little buddie!
I bought this having no prior experience with Roombas. It keeps my garages and workout room clean. It is meant for hard surfaces only. I have found it best to clean it thoroughly on a regular basis. It is amazing how much dog hair, dead bugs, leaves, etc. it collects, even in an area that looks OK to start with. My work areas have never been cleaner, and without much effort on my part! I just bought another for my Dad for Christmas, and recommend it to my friends and customers.

The Little Machine That Could
I sent two of these to relatives as gifts, hoping they would perform adequately. The iRobot 1100 Dirt Dog Workshop Robots far exceeded my expectations.  <br /><br />Both recipients are delighted with their Dirt Dogs, because the Dirt Dogs cleaned raunchy basement and garage floors far better than they expected, and watching the Dirt Dogs at work have become a favorite pastime.<br /><br />The people who received the Dirt Dogs showed them off to friends and relatives, and those people in turn find them sufficiently entertaining and efficient so they plan to buy them.<br /><br />We regard them as pets who clean floors rather than soiling them.  They are so efficient we would buy them even if they were ugly.  Amazingly good products!

Best Value
Okay here's what I have, a house of laminate and tile.  This is my second iRobot, the first (Rosie) was a red, early model, bare bones, version.  Cost $100 at Sears, lasted a year, worked great.  Second purchase was, Bob Dog, AKA Dirt Dog Workshop Robot.  After reading the reviews is seems the perfect match for my house(inside not garage), two dogs, and one cat, lots of sand and dirt brought in daily from the dogs who are walked many times a day.  Bob Dog is a work horse, he runs twice as long as the Rosie, he's not as loopy, I think she hit the bottle during the day:) Bob Dog is super easy to clean, remove holding cup, dump and replace.  No filters to clean, unlike Rosie and I have not had a problem with any dust being blown back into the air.  He gets put to work at least twice a day and through he's on the noisy side, no one pays much attention, including the pets, to him till he alerts us that he's done and ready to be dumped and recharged.  For my house, this product work wonders, and I see no need for the more expensive inside models.

A Great Time-Saver!
The floor in my office is rough exposed-aggregate concrete, comprised of a pebbly uneven surface that traps sand, crumbs, and other fine debris and is almost impossible to clean with a standard upright vacuum.  I also have a golden retriever that sheds constantly.  I had finally resorted to using a bulky shopvac to clean this floor, which was a hassle and took up a lot of storage space in the closet.<br /><br />I thought I would give the Dirt Dog a try, though I was skeptical that it would be able to clean such a rough and irregular surface.  After I charged it up, I turned it loose on the floor and watched it go to work.  To my surprise, it not only was able to handle the rough surface but it did a fantastic job of cleaning.  When it did encounter an especially bumpy section of the floor, it would stop, back up an inch or so, turn a few degrees, and take another run at it.  Most often it only took one extra try to get over any extra bumpy spot on the floor.<br /><br />After about an hour, I shut it off and flipped it over to clean it.  The dust bin was full of dog hair, paper clips, plastic bread wrapper clips, push pins, and pieces of dog kibble.  The bin was easy to empty and the brush was also easy to pop out and remove the dog hair that had wrapped around it.<br /><br />The floor looks great and I'm really satisfied with this purchase!

Works indoors!
Our goal was to buy a Roomba that would work well on hardwood floors. We were torn between 500 series and the Dirt Dog. After reading a lot of reviews and thinking about the pros and cons of the two alternatives, we chose the cheaper, more easily maintained option (Dirt Dog). Our biggest trade off was the loss of vacuuming-- the Dirt Dog only has brushes.<br /><br />I was uncertain how this would impact performance. A vacuuming robot should vacuum, right? After using it on hardwood and linoleum floors, I don't see a need for vacuuming. It picks up everything I can see on the floor, and the catch bin has all kinds of large and small stuff from the floor. I suppose it would not work so well on carpeting, but the Dirt Dog does a nice job on throw rugs (tuck tassles under the rug).<br /><br />Concerning the ease of maintenance issue. Long hair gets wound around the brushes. Fortunately, the Dirt Dog's brushes are easily removed and the Dirt Dog comes with a cleaning tool.<br /><br />We're very pleased and my nine-year old daughter LOVES it.

I can't stop raving about the dirt dog to my friends!
I had the feeling that this little machine would be awesome, and it has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There are only two downfalls that I can think of.  One, it's hard to stop watching the dog work!!  It's such an interesting invention and so far I've wasted so much time following him with my eyes glued to his every move... I like to see him get all the crumbs, etc, off the floor!<br /><br />I find myself talking to him,  "That'a boy... get 'em!!  You can do it!" Needless to say, I haven't saved much time yet. Once I get over the excitement of my new "toy", I'll have no problem leaving him to work by himself.  I mean, he does a nearly perfect job.  His brushes rotate rapidly and they get everything along the edges of the room.  The only thing "he" misses are the corners, but they're not bad at all.<br /><br />I have not used compressed air to clean him yet... for one thing, I'm not sure exactly what compressed air is, where you buy it, and all that jazz.  I'm going to have to ask my husband to show me... hopefully it won't be a big deal because the manual says that you're supposed to use compressed air after every third use. Even so, the Dirt Dog is worth it.<br /><br />I know that this machine is geared toward men for use in the garage/ their shop areas, but I love to use mine in the house!  I use it on my granite floors as well as on my carpet.  It easily adjusts to the different heights of the flooring.  It is excellent on my rugs (I don't have fringe on mine... I think the dog would have quite a lot of trouble with fringe... it would really get tangled).  When I would use my full-size vacuum on the rugs, they would tend to get sucked up and it was a real pain.  Not only that, I had to lug the big vacuum cleaner out.  It's so easy to get the Dirt Dog, press the "clean" button, and watch him go!<br /><br />He will clean under things that you have procrastinated cleaning for years.  He cleaned underneath my bed, my sofa (although some won't be high enough off the ground), my piano, etc.  He will even go around the legs of your tables.<br /><br />He'll run for about an hour, and then he needs to recharge for about 4 hours.  I often use him twice a day. In my dining area, he's completely replaced the dust mop. My kids and husband are jealous of him because they suspect that I think he does a better job than they do (it's true, he does). Even our dog is jealous, I can see it in his eyes.  He's an outdoor dog, but he'll press his nose against the glass door and see me following my "house pet" around giving him tons of attention.  Poor Scotty!<br /><br />The bin that the dirt is swept into is nicely sized and can hold a lot.  It's easy to empty.  The roller brushes to tend to pick up a LOT of hair, so it's a good idea to clean the brushes once in a while.  The Dirt Dog comes with a little cleaning tool, kind of like a letter opener with a small blade, which you can use to cut the hair and strings, etc, that get wrapped around the brush.<br /><br />I like my Dirt Dog so much that I can't say enough good about it!! I've told my friends about him, and I'm afraid that they must think I'm bragging.  I just want to "share the joy" with them!  The Dog is not a gimmick... it's fun to watch, but it works, too. I thank the people who invented him!  One of these days I'm going to buy the "robot mop", too, when the price comes down somewhat. I don't imagine that it will work as well as the Dirt Dog does, but I'm sure the iRobot people will perfect it...<br /><br />Did I mention that the Dog is not a vacuum?  It's actually a sweeper.  There is no suction, so it's amazing how much dirt, lint, etc, ends up in the dirt bin.  Trust me, it really does a great job.<br /><br />If the area you want to clean is extra large, the Dog might not get every single crumb.  It depends on the size of the room... just experiement like I have and you can improvise.  For example, when he's cleaning my kitchen and dining room floors, I'll usually block off the living room with chairs that he can't get through so that he'll be sure to do a thorough job in the dirtiest rooms first. If I see that he's still got some power left when the floor looks good, I'll take him into another room and let him work till he stops. He doesn't talk, but he makes some cute sounds. When his battery is low he makes a sound like, "I'm all done!" Once he's fully charged again and you press the clean button, he makes a sound like,  "I'm on my way!"  When he's stuck on something, it sounds like he's saying, "Uh-oh! Uh-oh!" (No, I am not crazy).  <br /><br />The first Dirt Dog I bought from Amazon, before Christmas, was $90 with free shipping. Around Christmastime the cost went up to $129. The cost is down again, so I'm buying another one for $95. I haven't seen the cost lower than Amazon's price of $90 anywhere on the Web. The Dog would make a great gift! I plan on buying one here and there throughout the year to give as gifts to my parents, siblings, and in-laws.  <br /><br />I hope my review has helped you! <br /><br />

Does what it is supposed to
This is my third "Roomba" (had the Roomba original and a 4200 series).  As others have noted, this is very similar, but without a vacuum (just a sweeper).  I use it regularly in my garage, workshop, and partially finished  basement.<br /><br />It rarely gets stuck, and it does a good job of getting into those tough to reach spots.  I especially like being able to clean my garage without taking the cars out.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Our family adopted a robot.
We have a black Labrador and a Doberman, and the shedding from the Lab is intense at the beginning of a Texas summer. The Doberman LOVES to get dirty and bring it in with her, so suffice to say, our indoor/outdoor  fur-babies make our home a little...messy.  With a new human baby  joining us and not liking the prospects of him getting down on our floors, we decided we needed help.  <br />Enter an iRobot Dirt Dog.  My first father's day present (a little early) was a robot that I had long regarded as an adult toy that was "more show than go".  I didn't take the effectiveness of an oversized hockey puck with a couple of styling brushes and  a Dust Buster bin very seriously.  An amusing gadget to have, if you don't already have a cluttered house (which we do).<br />I am here, now, to eat as much crow as I can.  Yes, I'm admitting I was WRONG! Well, okay, not exactly "wrong", but I seriously underestimated this "toy".  It is fantastic! So much better at cleaning our floors than WE are. We have a lot of nooks and crannies and furniture with deep undersides like our king sized bed and huge couch. We have carpet and linoleum floors, some with rugs, and tile. My retro 60's dining room table is a dust bunny collector with its four leg pedestal trapping them under protective 'feet' preventing our regular vacuum from getting them out. The rolling butcher block in the kitchen is similar, trapping dust bunnies just up under the wheels.  <br />Festus gets them all with his little 'claw" spinner that whisks them under his brushes for ingestion.  Yes, I anthropomorphized the blasted thing. After the second day, I dubbed him Hephaestus (Festus to shorten it), because he 'limps' (rolls) a little to one side when traveling in a straight line.  I don't know if that's a problem, but it doesn't impact his function in the least, and we put him to work twice a day, every day. I clean his brushes once a day, and we end up dumping his bin twice per charge.  Are we that filthy? Not really, but he keeps finding fur and detritus from SOMEWHERE.  The Lab is curious about him, and tries to intimidate him, but the Dobie avoids him as much as possible.  Occasionally he gets hung up on a bit of furniture or the lip of a linoleum-to-carpet transition, but I had heard that these robots are "smart", so I left him to his own devices the first few times to see if it were true, and sure enough: the little blighter eventually recognizes that he's hung up and tries a different solution.  The only times he has been unable to extricate himself from something he's gotten into is with my son's "bouncy seat". It has a metal frame that Festus rolls over and gets a wheel stuck on. When that has happened he eventually gives up and calls for help with a little "Uh-oh" beep.  Now I just put the seat away on top of the couch while Festus is working, and this is the only special concession I make for the robot's functionality.  <br />I love this little robot.  I plan on tricking him out with some stylized shark teeth, Flying Tigers style, and some googly eyes...Maybe a single spinner hubcap velcroed on top of him? Nah, that's too much.<br />There has been some talk of including him in the next family photo.  I figure why not, if the other dogs are there for it, the Dirt Dog should be too.

Working pet
You know how you have to bend over to pick up everything from the floor before you sweep? Well, with the Dirt Dog, you still have to. But that's it, push the button and walk out of the room. When you return, you do have to go look for it. Especially if you intend to open the garage door and drive the car out. The Dirt Dog just lays down and goes to sleep, wherever he is when he gets tired. He may be sleeping beneath the car tire. Full of dirt. Empty him out, plug him in and he's ready to go whenever you feel like picking up the shop before you leave again.

Very pleased with robot and customer service
I was impressed with the ease in which the Scooba operates.  Every part is clearly marked on the machine and the directions are uncomplicated.  The first time I used my Scooba, it started out working fine.  But then the "Check Tank" light came on without any apparent reason.  I opened and closed the tank, making sure it was securely locked and it started right up again.  I left the room and, when I returned after the cycle was completed, the floor was VERY wet.  When I emptied the dirty tank, there was barely any water in it!  It was obvious that the vaccum system that squeeges the floor and sucks the dirty water back into the machine wasn't working properly.  I called Customer Service and they were very helpful and immediately sent out a replacement part at no charge to me.  <br /><br />Actually, it turned out that the machine was working fine.  When I opened and closed the tank, the vaccum portal had some water around the opening and didn't seal properly when the machine started up again, making it impossible for the machine to create enough suction.  I recommend that anyone having this problem wipe the vaccum opening free of any water or debris and close the tank carefully to assure a proper seal.<br /><br />I've owned my Scooba for a couple of weeks and have used it several times since without any problem.  It gets the floor much cleaner than I would myself and I love knowing its cleaning my dirty kitchen floor while I'm taking care of business elsewhere.  After the cycle is completed, I take an old towel and, using the moisture left on the floor after the cleaning cycle, mop the corners with my foot.  It's quick and easy!  It goes under my baker's shelf without any problem and cleans the dog's feeding area beautifully.  One rainy morning, the dog left muddy footprints all over the kitchen floor so I put my Scooba to the test and it passed with flying colors!<br /><br />I think I'm in love!  Prior to getting my Scooba, I paid my teenage daughter to do the mopping and other house cleaning for her allowance.  Believe me, I'd much rather be the employer of "Scooba," my personal and pleasant Merry Maid!  She does a MUCH better job and she doesn't grumble and complain when I request that the floor be mopped.  Scooba hums instead of whistles while she works, which is music to my ears!  (I'm giving my daughter her notice this week.)

Absolutely Worth the Money
I have two children (1 and 10 year old boys) and three large dogs (great dane, mastiff, and shar pei), needless to say keeping floors clean is a struggle.  I also happen to have an obsession with clean floors.<br /><br />Every floor in my home is hardwood.  I run it twice a day (once per level) and now all of my belongings are no longer covered in dog hair and I can walk around in bare feet without feeling yucky.  If it only went up and down steps it would be perfect!<br /><br />Another bonus side effect is that, when you run it every day, it keeps all that dust and dirt from just floating around your house and clinging to other stuff so I have to clean less often in general.<br /><br />I suppose if I got out a bucket, sponge and set of knee pads I could do a better job but really who needs that in thier life?  I do suggest moving or stacking things like dining room chairs as the scooba'll get all tangled up in the legs and shut off.<br /><br />The only annoying thing was, when I firtst tried to start it up I kept getting the check tank warning for no apparent reason.  However, a quick search on the irobot site gave me a solution to the problem. (you have to use a turky baster to force water through the pump to get it going)<br /><br />This is the best $300 I ever spent.

It works !
I decided to write this review after 3 months of extensive use of my Scooba with at least weekly run.<br />I have good experience with my Roomba 4210 and iRobot in general when I had problems with my Roomba.<br /><br />My Scooba did not work right out of the box, it did not squirt any water at all.  This is the no. 1 complaint from Scooba owners. Here's what I did following many tips from other reviewers: <br /><br />1. Use syringe to squirt water into the blue "nipplet" - the little nipple insertion where the water drips from the tank to the base.<br />2. Pour half cup of water on the floor and let scooba run over it.<br /><br />After doing those two tips, the scooba pump started to work and I watched this robot prep,wash,vacuum and dry my floor without blinking my eyes.  Amazing.  The Clorox Scooba solution is also good for linoleum and most tiles.<br />The only drawback for the Scooba 5900 is its limited coverage, inability to work on textured tiles and noise but in overall I'm very satisfied.  Roombareview is also full of knowledgeable people to help you with your robots. Good job, iRobot !

Wow who knew it could work this well...
I bought this yesterday, charged it all night and had a test run this morning... WOW!!  My husband and I watched (in awe) as it went through it's entire cycle.  It did fabulous.  We have three kids and two Great Danes and, right now in Indiana, lots of mud and dirt being tracked in.  We have cream porcelain tile in our kitcen and it always looks dirty.  This Scooba did as good a job as when we mop ourselves.  Of course you may have to do some touch ups every now and then around the edges and in tight corners... but it did great.  Part of the secret is that it is always cleaning with clean water and "scooba" solution.  We were very impressed with the battery life also.<br /><br />Don't forget to prime the pump when you get it (before the first use).  I read this tip in one of the AMAZON reviews and it also had a reminder in the box.  Believe it or not I still forgot (I was so excited to get it going).  I will not work if you don't do this the first time. (light bulb moment)  I remembered that I was supposed to prime the pump (instructions in box for this) and it worked beautifully.  <br /><br />Plan to stay out of the room for awhile so the floors can dry when it's finished.  <br /><br />This is one of those purchases that you stand back and say WOW this was totally worth it!!<br /><br />

Fantastic Help for a Boring Chore
With the huge success of the Roomba, iRobot turned its mind to another task. How about washing kitchen and bathroom floors? Here's a chore that should be done weekly - but in many households it barely gets done once a month. What if a little Roomba like robot could handle floor washing chores?<br /><br />The Scooba came out with great fanfare in 2006. We bought one quickly, as we are so fond of our Roomba units. It was hard waiting overnight for it to fully charge before we gave it a run through. We carefully filled it up with the right amount of cleaning solution and water, and hit the clean button. It said 'check tank'. We did this a few times, then started hunting on Google for "check tank scooba". Voila - this happens with ALL Scoobas, because you have to prime the tank. It's simple to do - but surely they should have explained this in the manual! Once we primed the tank, it worked PERFECTLY.<br /><br />Roomba owners will find that the Scooba seems to move "slowly" - but there's a reason for this. In a single pass it has to lay out the cleaner, scrub, suck it back up again, and dry it a little. It's not like it does one pass to put out the cleaner and then another pass to clean it up. It's all done at one time, on one pass.<br /><br />The Scooba uses the same random-movement technique to eventually hit all areas of the floor. The floor isn't 100% perfectly dry when it does a pass - but neither is your floor dry if you use regular mops. You have to wait for it to air dry. We found that this dried more quickly than when we do it by hand - when it finished with one area and moved on to another, the first section was dry in about 5 minutes, so before the Scooba had even finished its full run.<br /><br />We were very impressed with how clean it got. My boyfriend walks around barefoot and could notice the difference immediately. It's a round unit, so it can't get into corners, and for a super-baked-on stain it didn't get it all up until a second pass. But heck, the purpose of this thing is to take care of the general cleaning of your floors. You're still going to do certain things manually, like pick up a soup bowl when it spills :) It's just like with the Roomba vaccuum - the fact that my Roomba goes around the carpet every day, picking up all the general stuff, means my carpets look great on a daily basis when I wake up with no work at all on my part. I still do steam clean them once a month or so, to get up the more ground in stuff. But that cuts my chore load WAY down, to have the daily work done.<br /><br />Not that we're running the Scooba daily! Once a week seems plenty for a kitchen floor for me. If you're a clean freak and want to do it daily, have at it. We all have different levels of cleanliness we like to maintain.<br /><br />The unit takes their cleaner or vinegar, so if you don't feel like buying their cleaner, you have an option. You can't dump just any cleaner into the unit, because most cleaners are meant to be rinsed out with water afterwards. This one is a one step process so it's different - the cleaner goes on and then is sucked up. There's no "rinse" stage. That seems reasonable to me, that you have to buy a cleaner meant to be used in that manner.<br /><br />Downsides? Well, the not-get-into-square-corners issue, but to be honest I don't know how you could fix that. If you made a smaller Scooba it wouldn't be able to clean a large area. If you made a square Scooba it would get stuck in spots. I think they did the best they could, and humans still need to do a few detail items to help out. That seems like a fine situation to me, to have a Scooba do most of the work!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Great Little Robot
Here are the most critical actions when using this great device.  One - before you buy, read the specs.  Two - after you buy read the owners manual.  Three - do what the owners manual tells you to do.  If you do all of this, you will have clean floors without a lot of elbow grease on your part<br /><br />Let me explain.  If you buy a Scooba that the manufacturer  says will do 250 sq. ft., believe it.  If your floor is really 350 sq. ft., don't write a one star review when the battery dies before completing the job.  If you don't follow the instructions and prime the pump, don't write a one star review when the robot doesn't dispense solution.  If you don't clean the device as instructed, don't complain when it gives you all sorts of warning lights and sounds.  In short, use it as intended and you'll love it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I vacuum my floors with a Roomba and then I follow that with a Scooba wash and my floors have never been cleaner.  Every couple of months, I get into the corners with a sponge, but that's about it.  These are great products (Roomba AND Scooba) and they really do work.  I use mine on linoleum, ceramic tile and slate without any problems.<br /><br />Suggestion: about every 4th use, run a white vinegar cleaning instead of using the Clorox solution.  The Clorox does a great job, but I suspect that it has a small amount of something to make the floors shine, and this seems to build up and feel a little slippery under bare feet.  No big deal, but the vinegar does seem to "refresh" the floor a little.

My Time Is Worth The Money
This is the first replacement I had to purchase for my Roomba Discovery.  I have had the Roomba since Christmas 2006 which was a good two years of running the Roomba 5-6 days a week.  I recently acquired (2) Dogs, Rott & Lab so the Roomba has been working over time picking up the hair before the battery life started to wane.  I did try re setting and that gave me some shelf life, but alas it was time for a new battery- well worth the money!

Brought new life to my Roomba Discovery
After having my roomba for about 2 years, the battery got to the point where it only lasted about 10 minutes per charge.  After trying the method by another reviewer to extend its life (a method which, for me, didn't do anything), I decided to fork out the money to buy a new one.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with my decision. Since replacing the battery, it's like I have a brand new roomba again. Rather than 10 minutes, it can go a few hours at a time before it gives up and goes to its dock for a recharge.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Battery works as advertised so far
My battery in my original roomba had died - it would not charge any more. I was actually going to buy a new roomba when I saw this battery replacement instead.  It is much heavier and denser than the original battery so I am looking for long life out of this battery.  I charged it overnight when I first got it.  So far it lasts long enough for the roomba to go through the longest cycle for a large room.  I recommend the APS (Advanced Power System) battery - I think it will give the best life.

This was the best price I found for the new battery.You would think iRobot could give a better deal on their own product but they don't. Amazon.com seems to have everyone beat on price and free shipping.

4905 Battery for my Roomba
Worked perfectly after a 24 hour charge with the unit plugged in- not on the platform. Charging with the AC allows for a little over 2 hours of use- whereas on the docking base- about an hour.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Works as expected
After leaving my Roomba unplugged and unused for more than 3 months, my battery died and no attempts to revive it worked. I was left with only one choice--buy a new battery! I considered cheaper alternatives (there are some do-it-yourself kits on the web where you replace only the inside of the battery) but in the end I decided to just buy a whole new battery. Well, my Roomba is back to its old self, it roams around the house and vacuums as good as new. I've had the battery for about a month and it's working just fine.<br /><br />Word of advice to every Roomba owner--never leave your Roomba unplugged for too long or your battery will die! It seems that the more you use the battery (and your Roomba) the longer it lasts!

This is the one to buy...make sure it's from Amazon
Very happy with this battery. This is definitely the one to buy. It is the original iRobot battery, not a knockoff. <br /><br />Make sure you understand how the charging system works and reset your Roomba and the plug in charger before you charge this new battery in it. Instructions are easily found at ( [..]) in the forums or by searching for 'reset roomba battery charge'. <br /><br />I am ordering another one for my mother who prematurely killed her original battery by not using it properly. <br />I must admit that although I used my Roomba more than my mom, I also made mistakes and killed my own original battery prematurely as well. You must use the Roomba every other day or charge the battery to full and remove it from the Roomba to safely go more than 48 hours without using the battery and not damage it.<br /><br />Now my Roomba is back as good as new, and I have educated myself on how to keep the battery at it's best for as long as possible. My Roomba does a great job (it is over 4 years old) and I am thrilled to have it once again on the job. My poor arthritic back thanks you Roomba.

Works for my Roomba
My old Roomba battery died.  I tried resetting my old battery, and it worked to give me just a few more cleanings.  When it died again I bought the bullet and purchased this one.  After letting it charge overnight, my Roomba is back to its old self.

Increases the usability of my Roomba Red
Between the lowering of the charge time to 3 hours from 7 hours AND the fact I can leave it in a room and have a 90% certainty of it being on the base charging when I get back to it, this has made my roomba red incredibly more useful.  I can drop it off to work in my bedroom when I get up.  in the middle of the morning put it in the baby's room.  Then grab it when I put her down for her nap and let it do the living room and have it recharged in time to have it do the basement or another room before dinner.<br /><br />With the quicker charge time and the automation of charging it has stopped me from considering spending the money on a second roomba since I get so much more out of my one.<br /><br />If your roomba did not come with the fast charger and the docking base, this will make your roomba so much more useful.  Oh and no more finding the little guy stuck in the middle of under a bed.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Works perfectly!  (And as advertised)
This item won't change your life, but I do believe it makes the basic functionality of my Roomba better.   I highly recommend you think about whether this base will work for YOU.  In my case, I live in an apartment where all four rooms come together in a common corner.   So I put the home base there, where the Roomba will pass it anytime it leaves any room.   And my Roomba has found its way back literally 100% of the time.  <br /><br />What I like about the Home Base:<br />* My Roomba is always there, where I can find it.<br />* In the morning, I just walk over to the home base and tap the "Clean" button with my toe.   I know that about an hour later the Roomba will be right back where it started.<br />* When the roomba is on the base and I push the "Clean" button, it makes an adorable construction-equipment like beep as it backs up!<br />* Three-Hour charge cycle.  (I bought the base for my Roomba Red, which only comes with a 7-hour charger.)<br />* I don't have to come home and search for my Roomba, which used to stop under the bed or in the darkest corner of my closet.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />* The Roomba actively avoids the home base while it's cleaning.  That means that about 6 inches around the home base never get vacuumed.  This is obviously a safety feature, so that the roomba doesn't eat the base's power cord, but it means that I sometimes have to pick up the home base and move it elsewhere if I want that spot vacuumed.<br /><br /><br />So... the home base turned out to be a great investment for ME, because my floor plan works out very well.   If you're living in some monstrous mansion where the roomba might wander a quarter mile off before coming back to the base, this product likely isn't right for you.  (And then again, you'll probably have a maid instead of a robot vacuum)
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
90% accurate and a 3 hour charger,  Well worth it....
When Roomba is getting low it WILL seek out its home base.  You do however need to place the base in the middle of the cleaning area with plenty of visiblity.  If this is done, Roomba will find its way home.  This feature is also nice because it will charge the Red  in 3 hours instead of 7. <br /><br />If you have an L shape floor, well that is what the virtual wall is for.  For example, you clean one area (living room, Dining room) and then you do the other area (Family room, Kitchen).  Not to tough to figure out.

Roomba's Home Base
This is much better than the standard charger. Charges faster, and when the charge gets low on the Roomba it finds it on  its own and mounts it.<br />That sounded wierd but it works well.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Works Like it should
The product description is accurate and easy to understand, plus it works as it says it will. It is  lightweight so pay attention to the instructions and place it against a wall,especially on hard slippery floors. Just plug it in, follow the brief instructions and 30 seconds later your roomba is on it's new home/charger.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Must Have !
If you purchase a Roomba you really need to get this self charger too.  The Roomba will come back to the charger and charge itself !  You don't have to remember to track him down after use and put him on charge.  This way he is always charged and ready to go when you want to use him.

Roomba Charger
GREAT product. I let my roomba run and when I come home it is charged for the next room!

Entertaining and convenient
The self charging base is great.  It fun just to watch the Roomba find the base and attach itself.   It doesn't hurt that it's really convenient to just let the Roomba go vacuum, then find it docked and charger after it's done.

Love this little vac!
This is a fantastic little vac.  It isn't as loud as my last stick vac and it doesn't scratch my wood floors.  The first day I bought it I really put it through the paces.  I was impressed with how well it cleans floors, carpets and rugs with fringe.  I love the fact that you can turn off the roller to do the fringed rugs and floors.  It picked up popcorn and screws easily.  Sand and gravel from the kids shoes, no problem.  After a rain, the floor got a little muddy from all the kids going in and out so I just turned on the brush and VOILA, the dried mud went right up.  <br />It really does stand on it's own, even on a soft cushy carpet.  <br />The only changes left to make is to lengthen the cord a bit and put a small pull-out nozzle high up on the side so I can use it for practically everything, such as dusting windowsills.  I won't let my wish list ruin the review though.  5 stars for the best little vac I've had yet.

The guy review of a bagless vacuum-UPDATE
I went out looking for a small vacuum WITH a bag, trying to avoid the bagless (didn't want to deal with the dust), but changed my mind when I found this one. <br /><br />Excellent and no-nonsense.  I can whip this baby out and have it running in 3 seconds.  This thing is great for quick clean ups, like the kitchen, although I have used it for a complete downstairs vacuuming<br /><br />Good points: two modes--carpet and floor.  Works both surfaces great.  The carpet-mode simply powers up the power head roller.<br /><br />The low-profile, swivel head means I can get under everything, everywhere, even couches, which means less furniture to move.<br />Quick-release power cord hook, so I'm not spending five minutes unraveling the reasonably-long cord.<br /><br />See-thru "unbag" so you know when it's getting full.<br /><br />It is small enough to store anywhere, even has a hole in the top of the handle to hang in a closet.<br /><br />Bad points:  I'm thinking hard on this one.  OK, the power switch is too low (see the picture).  It is also bagless, which I found is actually GOOD point as it keeps this vacuum light and small.  The "bag" is very easy to pull out and empty.  With no bags to buy, the price makes this an excellent choice.  <br /><br />It's also great for chasing cats around the house.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The handle needs some kind of rubber coating to prevent it from falling when leaned against a wall or counter; managed to break the lower cord catch due to repeated falls. Naturally, I immediately bought another (from Amazon, of course).<br />

LOVE THIS VAC!
I agree with other users. This Vac really gets its done! I was so happy with it's ability to pick up small/lightweight items, and when used up against baseboards it got everything! I LOVE the fact you can switch on/off the carpet brush feature, my full size Vas was too powerful for my area rugs, and this Flair gets the job done easily!  Everytime I use it I am shocked at how much it has picked up! Things I didn't even know were there! The largest items I've seen it pick up so far was a Cheerio without a problem. And my 16 month old doesn't mind the mild sound of this Vac either!  I have recommended to all my family and friends with tile or wood floor, works great!  I would also like to see a longer cord and detachable hose feature for tough to reach spots, but overall this is 5 star!

THE FERRARI OF VACUUMS! Bright Red, Really Handles On the Corners!
My wonderful hubby got this for me last xmas.  Of course, I "helped" him pick it out after much research.<br /><br />I actually have a full sized shop-vac that I use inside for cleaning every couple of days because we have 2 cats, a dog and a very messy husband and son.  Our dog likes to carry her food around the house...don't ask me why.  My husband gardens...I'm surprised there's any dirt left in the yard with as much as he tracks in!  I use a triple filter on it, works great.  I throw the attachments in the dishwasher after I use them and they're sparkling clean and sanitized.<br /><br />But in between the shop-vac cleanings I use my sports car...uuuhhh...I mean vacuum.  It is awesome on bare floors as well as my polypropylene rug.  I don't have any carpet in the house, but I can't imagine it wouldn't be awesome on that as well.<br /><br />This thing is soooooo cute that I keep it in the dining/family room!  I love it!  You just turn the handle right or left and it turns for you.  It's really light and is low profile so it fits under my cabinets.<br /><br />There are two "speeds".  Suction alone, and suction + beater bar.  In fact, it has such suction that I can't vacuum smaller rugs such as the one in the bathroom (22" x 60") because the vacuum sucks them up when the beater bar is on. <br /><br />It has a totally cool filtration system.  I'm allergic to dust and I haven't had any sort of a problem while using it.  When it gets full, you empty out the dirt cup and you're on your way.  If you don't empty the cup when you should, the vacuum loses all suction to prevent overheating, which is a great feature.  <br /><br />Ok, just a couple of negative points.  I had to take it apart once (we're talking like 1 screw) to unclog it.  That was my booboo because I let it get overstuffed.<br /><br />Another things is that it has a sort of burning rubber smell.  It doesn't bother me but I sprinkled a bit of those carpet granules on the rug, vacuumed it up and it smells gorgeous now.<br /><br />No, I don't work for Hoover.  No, I'm not getting commission for this review.  We didn't even buy it on Amazon.  This is the only review I've written so far, and that really says something!

I love this vac, too!
I'm so happy with the S2220 stick vac that I'm giving it 5 stars, despite my one major complaint: The final filters, on either side of the upper body (red part), can not be cleaned but have to be replaced when they get dirty. The part number is 591360-22 and only costs $1.99 (for one)--but Hoover charges $7.50 shipping for this part which could easily be mailed in a regular, legal sized envelope. It can most easily be located doing a search for, "59136022." Amazon does not sell this. If anyone finds a place that has lower s/h than Hoover, please share it here.<br /><br />Other than the above, I couldn't be happier. This is my third Hoover stick vac and by far the best. My first, a 2-speed Quik-Broom, purchased years ago, lacked a power nozzle but was great on hard floors. The cup had a much larger capacity, but it didn't trap dust from being exhausted the way the S2220 does. It was damaged by water so I replaced it with a Hoover S2571 Cyclonic Action 2-speed, which was never satisfactory. It's cup and filtering system were similar but different to the S2220 and it did a VERY poor job of even sucking-up kitty litter. When the plastic handle cracked, despite being carefully used, I researched stick vacs here and decided to try the S2220 since people raved about it.<br /><br />Other reviewers who love this Hoover Flair are right, in my opinion. The swivel head is great, the machine is so light it's easy to clean steps with, and the power nozzle does a fantastic job of getting pet hair off even cheap doormats that were next to impossible to completely clean in the past. Floor cleaning is not my idea of a good time, but I'm finding that using the S2220 is so easy and convenient, that my floors are cleaner than ever.<br /><br />Really, I am very pleased with this purchase. I just wish Amazon sold the replacement side filters.

HARDWOOD FLOOR GREAT VACUUM
I just had new hardwood floors put in my entire apartment (Bellawood beech select) and did a google search for "vacuum that won't scratch hardwoood floors" and it brought me here.  As usual, the reviews are VERY informative and this one got some great ones so I figured I'd try it.  Great price.  I've had it a month now and it is GREAT.  Very powerful.  Picks up everything.  I use it for the little rugs (2' x 3') I have in my kitchen and it does a great job on those, too.  Make sure you press the lever ALL THE WAY DOWN and hear the LOUDER noise to know that it's on "carpet" setting.  Otherwise you're on hardwood floor setting.  Very long cord.  Easy to clean.  Boy does it get filled with dirt and carpet detritus.  I clean it out after each use.  The manual is very good.  Really explains the very important chore of cleaning the cup and filter.  Has not scratched my floors.  VERY PLEASED WITH THIS VACUUM.

WORKS GREAT! ....... VERY POWERFUL!
I purchased this unit, based on many favorable reviews from previous buyers.  After a couple of weeks of use, let me now add my kudos for this very capable machine.  <br /><br />The vacuum has solid build quality and the filter system works well.  The unit has amazing suction for a unit of this type and seems to work well on both hardwood floors and rugs/carpets.  It is also relatively quiet.  Another nice touch is the rotating top hook where the power cord is stored.  That allows you to unwind the cord and get the unit into use very quickly.  <br /><br />The swivel vacuum head and "lay down" body/head connection allows you to get under areas where my larger vacuums cannot go.<br /><br />Some buyers have complained about the 20' power cord being too short, but that has not been a problem.  The unit is so lightweight, you can hold it in one hand, unplug the vacuum and simply move to the next outlet.<br /><br />I have used cordless vacuums/power brooms before and none of them were even in the same league as the Hoover S2220.

"Smartest" & Best Vacuum I've Ever Owned
I have to thank one of the Amazon reviewers as this really helped me make the decision to get this SMART vacuum. <br /><br />How can a vacuum be "smart"? First, the vacuum is the smoothest glide, (I have all bare floors, no carpet) it REALLY gets under the furniture, under the bed, etc. It's super powerful suction immediately sucks up any dirt - fast and easy. <br /><br />Next, I opened the clear dirt holder filter to clean it out, and what this "smart filter" does is it separates any solid pieces. So at the bottom of the holder was my earring post (that tiny thing for the back of an earring) that I couldn't find. A push pin, a dime and a penny - all in perfect condition. <br /><br />The filter will hold all of the dust - it somehow compresses it. And then it will "filter out" anything that is solid. I never saw a vacuum do that before!<br /><br />The suction power is super strong, it just pulls in any dust or dirt in front of it.<br /><br />I've bought many vacuums over the years. Every purchase was a disappointment. With THIS "Flair" bagless vacuum, cleaning tile or wood floors is soooo much easier. <br />If you're not sure WHICH vacuum to get, and you have bare floors, THIS IS THE ONE to GET!

The Hoover Flair is the Best!
Known as a "cleaning fanatic" by my family and friends, I wanted a small vacuum for quick cleaning jobs.  I already own two other expensive brand vacuums that are heavy to carry, so I wanted one that's light-weight and easy to use since I've had two back surgeries.  I also have a few cats and I vacuum a lot.  I needed a good vac to clean up cat litter and cat fur.  I always heard that Electrolux vacuums were one of the best, so I bought the Electrolux cordless stick vac for $99.  It had good suction power for a cordless, but it only ran about 10-15 minutes before the charge wore out.  I returned the Electrolux and bought the Hoover Flair - - I LOVE it!!  I never owned a stick vac, but the Flair is powerful on ceramic tile and rugs.  I love the swivel head and it's easy to maneuver under furniture and around table legs.  The dust cup is easy to remove and empty, too.  I've never had problems with the vac shutting off and I have big size rooms and use it over 45 minutes at a time.  It's the best little vacuum and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small, light-weight vacuum to use in between heavy cleaning jobs.  I'm amazed that such a small vaccuum has so much suction and does such a great job!  I'll definitely buy another one when this one wears out.    <br />

Loved it Loved it Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Before I ordered I read the other reviews and thought I would take a chance since they were all good. Actually I was in the process of ordering a different brand but went to look at reviews. So, if you think your review does not matter think again.<br />Now, for the product. It is wonderful. Not only does it do a good job on the floors but because it is so light weight I can use it on my funiture. Which makes taking care of pet hair a lot easier. Emptying the basket is a breeze. I can think of nothing I would change. <br />Thanks to the reviewers I checked for leading me to this product.

This thing s*cks, but that's a good thing!
I had a Hoover Sprint for 7 years that I loved, but it was beginning to lose suction.  I purchased this after reading so many great reviews and have not been disappointed.  I love the fact that it cleans carpets as well as hard woods and I'm always surprised by how much is in the dirt container when I empty it.  I also love that it stands up on its own as my old one did not.  The only things I don't like are 1) the head is not quite as wide as my last one so I'm sure I spend a bit more time covering an area and 2) the head is thicker vertically so it doesn't fit very well between my cabinets and floor.

I've summed up product comparisons for you!
I spent days and days reading reviews for the perfect steam mop and I felt that the Eureka Enviro Steamer was the best choice.  I'll sum up what I LOVE about my Eureka Enviro Steam Mop.<br />Eureka Euro Features:<br />1. Swivel head (a must,  can get around objects)<br />2. tall and removable handle (yes you can take the handle off and steam your counters to sterilize them)<br />3. Eureka has been making steam mops for over a decade and this is the 2nd version of their VERY POPULAR steam mop. <br />4. Long cord.<br />5.Weight is on the floor where the water tank is, this makes it easier to use and makes for less scrubbing (tanks on the handle make you scrub and push down more to remove grim)<br />6. NO PUSH TRIGGER! This means CONSTANT steam.  Who wants to hold down a button the whole time you're mopping?<br />7. The steam vents are from SIDE to SIDE..not one hole in the middle like some.<br />8. THICK and tough waffle cone pads. Picks up plenty.<br />9. HIGH heat (220 degrees)<br />10. About 3 minutes to heat water.<br />11. Leaves very little water on floor, dries quickly.<br />12. TOTALLY GREEN!  Okay, I'm not a green fanatic (I don't recycle, sorry guys) but this product makes me feel like I'm making a difference! No wasteful trash (i.e. disposable pads) and it uses JUSTS water. No chemicals!<br />OKAY NOW SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD HEAR OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT OTHER MOST POPULAR MODELS:<br /><br />MONSTER STEAM MOP:   <br />1. BAD HANDLE (complaint after complaint about flimsy handle and it breaks when pushing too hard).<br />2. takes 5+ min to heat up.<br />3. does not have a swivel head.<br />(compared to Eureka: does heat up more- 266 degrees and does have extra burst of steam in front, more expensive)<br />SHARK STEAM MOP:<br />1. very flimsy handle and plastic tank (both break easily)<br />2. you have to "pump' the handle to get steam.<br />3. hard to push because the weight of the water is half way up the handle on the tank)<br />4. tends to "sleep" in the middle of the job as it takes a break to re-heat the water for the next pumping action.<br />5. heats to about 110 degrees.<br />BISSELL STEAM MOP:<br />1. Again, top/plastic water tank-very flimsy. <br />2. leaves very wet floors.<br />3. uses a "trigger" again to get steam.<br />4. thin pads, get soaked easily.<br />5. not hot enough (110 degrees)heats pad, but not more than hot water from your sink.<br />6. One steam hole in the middle, not all the way across like Monster or Euro or HAAN.<br />HAAN STEAM MOP:<br />1. cost more money<br />2. handle breaks again and not tall enough<br />3. does have attachments and removable handle<br />4. water has leaked from tank and burns hands when lifting up to steam object (like counters, beds, etc).<br />H20 steam mop:<br />1. 130 degrees temp<br />2. tends to leak from the tank and the tank is flimsy.<br />OKAY THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT THINS TO CONSIDER FOR ALL STEAM MOPS.<br />1. They aren't going to clean your grout. If you steam it and then get in there with a brush or rag I'm sure it will come up, but ALL fiber pads don't have "fingers" deep enought to get in the grout (neither will any product likely except a good ole fashioned brush) But they will be sterilized!<br />2. You need to take in consideration what type of water you have.  All hard water will clog up your steamer over time.  Use soft/distilled water (we installed a water softener in our house because we had VERY hard water)You could clean it with a de-calcification product (like CLR) or vinager occasionally.<br />3. You should NOT use a steam mop on unsealed wood or waxed floors.  We are talking HIGH HEAT here and you're going to ruin wood if it isn't sealed, or melt that wax and make a mess.<br />4. Water should be at least 155 up to 212 degrees to kill germs (depending on the type of bateria).  Steam is nice, but not if it isn't hot enough to kill bateria.<br />5. These are not ALL IN ONE floor cleaners.  You are STILL going to have to vacuum. Heck-do what I did-invest in a Iroomba robot vacuum (HSN has Flex Pays) AND a steam mop.  You'll have floors you can eat off of every day for very little effort. <br />6. My opinion is that ANYTHING that is rechargeable ins't going to last as long as something with a cord. Batteries have weird electronic memory to them (yeah I'm obviously not a tech pro) and they are luckly to last 6m! Don't waste ANY money on those rechareable products. They are a waste.<br />All in all this is the BEST product I've found for the cost, unless you want to invest a fortune in commercial grade steamers. I'm THRILLED with this purchase!!!<br /> <br />Update: After 10 months, I'm still thrilled.  However, many complain that the first couple of uses the mop tends to leak a lot and leave the floors very wet.  Although I never did experience this, many have and the solution they have found is that it requires a couple of uses to "season" the product and then the appropriate amount of steam and heat becomes reliable.  <br />

The top steam mops: Results of steam mop first hand comparisons & studying of comps
Know going in If you get the Envirosteamer, know that, though it cleans the best, the first two times you use it the water goes through holes faster than it will in subsequent uses, so it will go through steam faster and your floors will be wetter than normal. Enough people wrote me to know this happened the first one or two times as it did my first time of use,  then after that the mop was normal, our floors are great  and it lasts waaaah longer. We don't know why.  Just know that going in.  After the first two initializing uses it steams perfect! Also obviously the steam lasts longest if you don't hold the mop above the floor to walk to another area since the steam pours out as it will with any steam mop if you do. <br /><br />(update: This review was updated on 11-2-09 after I got to compare the Bissell as well as add notes about the Ladybugg steamer at the bottom, and then on 11-30 when I got to compare the SteamFast SF-140 and on 12-7 to compare the Steam Boy) <br /><br />I live in a neighborhood where EVERY home is "green built certified" this means that, to have that certification, the builder built no homes with carpet. All the main floors are polished concrete and the upper floors wood. The bathrooms all have tile and/or slate in every home. <br /><br />Because of this, as you could imagine, steam mops are quite the neccessity...not only because they get the hard surfaces better than anything else, but because they are also "green" and clean chemical free. I'll be honest, for us...that's a bonus but we weren't cleaning chemical free before. We like chemical free for our pet's paws but I'll confess I was mopping with chemicals before I got my steamer and just kept the pets out of the room while doing it because, up until then, I couldn't get it clean any other way. <br /><br />Okay, so that said...we decided to have a steamer show down to compare 7 different steamers because my friends and I knew as long as we are in these homes we are gonna have to have a steamer to get all these hard floors clean...we may as well figure out which one to buy next go round. Because my own home is graced with 2 cats, 3 dogs, and two gregarious cooks, my kitchen floor (which had not ever been cleaned by a steamer since my steamer had just arrived) was the testing spot. <br /><br />Mind you, I vaccuum twice per week and do a mega mop twice a week. I THOUGHT I had pretty clean floors in spite of my pet capacity. <br /><br />I thought wrong. These picked up dirt so well it's scary <br /><br />So here's the results: <br /><br />1. steam mops are the mac daddys of clean floors. What these things picked up was tremendous and no comparison to my vigorous prior constant major mopping. <br /><br />2. So now I'll break down the elements of each mop we used and then go into more detail about each at the end. <br /><br />We tried out: <br />"S": The shark by Europro <br />"E" The Envirosteamer by Eureka <br />"H" the haan steamer <br />"M" the Monster <br />"B" The Bissell Green Tea <br />"SF" The SteamFast SF-140 by SteamFast<br />"SB" The SteamBoy T1 <br /><br />CORD LENGTH: so you don't have to stop and unplug and replug in somewhere else: <br />Shark ( will be referred to as S):20 feet <br />Envirosteamer (will be referred to as E): 25 feet *Note* The Envirosteamer has a clip at the top of the handle to keep the cord out of the way. When it's plugged in and you need more cord length, a light tug undoes this cord on the clip so that you have the full 25' of cord. Otherwise it's only around 20 feet. It's made to do this.<br />Haan: (will be referred to as H)19'8" <br />Monster (will be referred to as M): 25 feet <br />Bissell (will be referred to as B) 17 feet <br />SteamFast (will be referred to as SF): 18.7 ft.<br />SteamBoy (will be referred to as SB): 16 ft. <br /><br />STEAM TEMPERATURE: this is a primary element. The hotter the steam, the more dirt picked up and hot steam will also kill parasites, mold and mildew and loosen more dirt: <br />S 110 degrees. lame <br />E 220 degrees. very hot <br />H 212 degrees. very hot <br />M 266 degrees. hottest...although the envirosteamer and haan seemed plenty hot enough. The shark didn't clean nearly as well and this was one reason. 110 degrees just isn't going to melt off stuck on grime. <br />B 125 degrees. Note that, because of this low steam temperature the manual said that if I wanted to sanitize the floor or pick up caked on spills, I had to hold the steamer on the spot for 15 seconds but no more than 20 because that could damage some floors. Now I don't know about you, but if I can sanitize with one swipe of the other steamers because of their sanitizing temps my floor will be done WAY faster but I don't have a timer to worry about the extra 5 secons where my wood floors could get damaged. My sink water is hotter than this so it would take less time to use a regular mop if I have to hold the steamer on every spot of my floor for 15 seconds to santize. Just sayin <br />SF: 137 degrees. Not hot enough to clean well nor sanitize.<br />SB: 120 degrees. Not hot enough to clean well nor sanitize <br /><br />BUILD: <br />We found how it was made corresponded with issues with the steamer. The Shark, for example, was quite flimsy and they actually sell replacement handle kits because so many people have issues with the handle breaking! We know this because my neighbor's shark broke and the store had a replacement handle kit on the shelf because he said "it happens often". That's an extra cost. <br />Envirosteamer: Was 5.4 lbs which made it lightweight but strong enough that you didn't have to press down to clean. Very well made and strong parts <br />Haan: not made as well as the envirosteamer but it's more expensive so this was a surprise. A bit flimsy and you need to press down on it more to clean at 3.15 lbs. <br />Monster: hefty and well made at 9 lbs but a bit too heavy unless you want a good workout. (Note: They have changed the Monster handles on the mops now and they are all plastic and people are having breakage issues) <br />Bissell: It's 8.4 pounds but that includes a water filter that you have to get for this one (see notes below) <br />SteamFast: very flimsy plastic all over, but it's also more affordable than the other mops so it's a bit of a trade off. 7 lbs.<br />SteamBoy: They didn't even ship this preassembled like the other mops. We had to assemble it! Pretty flimsy plastic. 9 lbs but that includes the water filter you have to get with this one (see notes below) <br /><br />WATER CAPACITY: Very important because having to stop and add more water just adds on to the time you have to spend cleaning, especially if you are cleaning a hallway or livingroom or some other area that has no sink: <br />S: only holds up to 10 oz of water. Lasted for 10 miinutes of cleaning <br />E: holds up to 20 oz. of water. Lasted for over 20 minutes of cleaning (we stopped at 20 and it was still going) <br />H: holds up to 11.83 oz of water. Lasted for 13 minutes of cleaning <br />M: holds up to 17 oz. of water. Lasted for 15 minutes of cleaning <br />B: holds up to 13 oz of water, lasted for 12.5 minutes of cleaning AND you have to undo and remove the tank from the machine every time you fill it up then hook it back on and the steam tank is on the handle rather than the base so the steam doesn't flow directly out after heating up which may explain why it's not as hot once it leaves the machine. The way this mop is made the water flows past heating elements which can, according to Bissell, develop calcium deposits on it so this is the only mop where, because of this, you also have to use a water filter with it and replace the water filter when there is build up which means and extra 12 bucks every few months. The better mops are made to heat the water in a metal tank so this is not an issue and you pour the water directly into the tank. <br />SF: Holds the least amount of water and I had to stop and fill up and get the water reheated often in trying to clean the floor. Only holds 8 oz of water and if you use 8 oz it gets your floor too wet so we wound up filling it with just up to 7.5 oz of water for best results and it only lasted 7 minutes when we did that before we had to refill again.<br />SB: up to 24 oz BUT it only lasted for 12 minutes of cleaning. I think because of the build. This one also is made so that the water has to flow past heating elements down the handle, rather than flowing directly from a hot tank to the floor at the base. Because of this it can develop calcium deposits inside the mop so you have to also buy a water filter for this mop and replace it every few months when there is build up which means extra cost and, quite possibly, more repairs. Because this does not flow directly out of a hot tank it cools on the way down and possibly with this one evaporates somehow because we tried it twice and the steam simply didn't last as long as it should. <br /><br />STEAM HOLES: We found a difference although you'd think they'd all be the same. The shark only had one hole that the steam came out of so it wasn't cleaning things on the edges, just in one spot. All the others had steam coming from bottom and sides. Steamboy also didn't have holes near the edge <br /><br />SIZE: The taller it is the less stooping, the wider the mop head, the more it covers <br />S: 40"Hx12"Wx7"D <br />E: 50"Hx13.25"Wx6.75"D (the fact that this depth was smaller made it reach under applicances better...it fit better under things) <br />H: 50.5x11.5x7.5 <br />M: 48x12.7.5 <br />B: 45.25H (this was uncomfortably short) x11 x8.4 (even though this didn't fit under cabinets because of the depth it did swivel the best) <br />SF:49x11.8x7<br />SB: 28.2x6.9x7.9 <br /><br />Conclusion of comparison: First it must be pointed out that, in order to use the shark and the Bissell and the SteamBoy, you had to keep pumping the water. This was the most annoying feature of anything...the others just steamed on their own and didn't wear out your fingers. Hated this feature of the shark and Bissell and SteamBoy. We liked that the Monster, the Shark, the Envirosteamer, the SteamFast and the Bissell came with 2 cleaning pads rather than one. The Haan only came with one at the time of the review (I double checked since when she bought hers it was also only one and as of today, that hasn't changed) so that ups the price even more because I can't imagine only wanting one to clean. All worked well on sanitizing mattresses and showers. too. <br /><br />But the winner picked by all of us unanimously as the mop we want to have for our next steam mop order? <br />The Eureka Envirosteamer. It picked up the most dirt, was made as well as the Monster but was less expensive, held the most water, emitted the most very hot steam so it sanitized as well, lasted 3 times as long with one water resevor fillup as the others, and had a cord as long as the monster. BUT if you have carpets than I would recommend the Monster because it has a carpet attachment that allows you to steam clean your carpets and it picked up pretty close to the same amount of dirt as the Eureka Envirosteamer, and had close to the same features...a bit heavier though but that may make it last even longer. It is costlier, but to clean 2 surfaces I would think that might make it worth it. <br /><br />UPDATE: The Haan just started including 2 pads with the mop according to the product description page. Not that this changes our opinion since it didn't work as well and the parts were flimsier, but it should be noted that this issue of not having enough cleaning pads has now been resolved and is equal to the other mops. <br /><br />ANOTHER UPDATE: 1. The Shark came out with a new machine that holds more water and has a longer cord BUT it still only heats the water to 110 degrees so it won't sanitize or get rid of trapped grime at this "bathwater" temperature. <br /><br />Another update: Since this review, we tried out canister mops. They work great for tight areas, but not on floor cleaning because the steam has to travel from the canister, down a long tube, then out the base so the steam is even cooler than the shark by the time it reaches the floor, even on the most expensive models. However, if you are looking at something just to steam tight areas like grout, and don't need it for your floor, the Vapamore performed the best out of the canister mops we played with when using the short cords for cleaning so the steam left the tank hot.<br /><br />Also: Don't spend money buying extra pads for the Eureka. I was in a pinch and used a kitchen dish towel...the rectangular kind...just clip on both ends. It worked just as good or better...because they are thinner so the steam penetrates faster and therefore reaches the floor hotter. However, I would recommend still only using the thick pads that come with it for your wood floors just to be safe. But the super hot steam penetrating the dish towel worked excellent on tile and hard floors. Also, you can flip both the towel and the pads that come with it on the Eureka to double the usage...when it gets dirty, just flip it over and use the other side. I use several old dish towels with this but I like best the kind that just have a bit of texture but no squares sewn on them...but they all work great. So do the pads.<br /><br />Also we noticed that a reviewer above us on the page flattered us by adding all of our information you read in our review about cord length, all the mops, steam temperatures we measured etc into her older review that is first on the page that originally contained none of this information. However, now that she edited her review to include our 6 hrs of research we apologize that it makes reading these two reviews very redundant. We promise when we first posted this review that no other review on this page contained any of the information on temperatures etc in our review until we posted our findings and they were copied into an older review higher on the page via editing. It's pretty boring now for the reader to read the same thing twice. But we are flattered someone felt it good enough research to want to copy into their review so we hold no grudge...I just didn't want anyone to think we were being redundant.  :-)  )<br /><br /><br />WHY YOU WANT THE TANK ON THE BOTTOM/MOP HEAD: All steam starts out at 212 degrees. Some mops increase the heat from there. Some mops heat the water up, then it has to travel down tubes and get to the base, and then leave the holes, which results in a cooling process. This can also result in calcium deposits along that piping which eventually clogs the waterflow or makes you buy and store filtered water to use in the mop. On mops like the Envirosteamer, the water is heated in a stainless steel tank at the base of the mop and flows directly out onto the floor instantly with no traveling through the mop so it leaves the mop steaming hot. Put your hand over a cup of coffee directly at the top of the coffee. That's hot steam. Now move your hand waaaay up above the coffee cup where there is still steam but it is further from the heat source due to traveling. It's cooler steam. The mops are no different. Plus putting the weight at the head of the mop puts the preasure on the pad, not the handle you have to push.<br /><br />CLOTHS: I like 100 percent cotton better than microfiber. Microfiber streaks. Although some complain about the Envirosteamer's pads shrinking they are meant to. I wash em in hot water. They'll fit perfect after they shrink so don't even be concerned. (they are cotton and quite absorbant.)

Throw away your mop.
Very happy to see the Enviro Steamer return !!!  I have had the 311A enviro steamer for 2 years.  I had to  pay an arm & a leg for it on ebay because Eureka discontinued this product several years ago.  Mopping was my least favorite chore, it almost brought me to tears I hated it so much.  I have over 1200 sq.ft. of tile in my house & keeping it clean used to be a daunting task.   UNTIL........the enviro steamer.<br /><br />One of the best purchases I have ever made.  No more bucket & mop,  no more over perfumed wet jet that leaves you with a sticky floor & expensive replacement pads & fluids.  Now it is just water, the enviro steamer, a washable & reusable magic pad & me.  I actually consider cleaning my floors FUN now.  By the way.....men love using the enviro steamer, you may even find your husband cleaning the floors more often. <br /><br />Hint:  Get a few extra Magic pads, 1 or 2 is not enough unless you have only 1 small area to clean.  After I finish with 1 room, I just slap a new pad on, refill the water, give the enviro steamer a few minutes to heat back up & I'm on to the next room.  The first room is dry in minutes & clean.

This is THE ONE to buy
I LOVE my Enviro Steamer.  I bought my first one 10 years ago.  Last fall, it gave up the ghost because of a design issue that has been solved in the new incarnation.  In fact, the three minor things I did not like about my earlier model are solved in the new model.  Way to go Eureka!<br /><br />I made the mistake of trying a couple of other designs (Shark killed my back! and another one that was definitely made in China...both of the ones shipped to me never worked right).  I was so happy when I went back to the internet and saw the Enviro Steamer was available again.<br /><br />I told my husband I actually felt like dancing I was so happy to be steam mopping with my Enviro Steamer.  I have about 800 sf of tile, I just fill and go, it covers the whole area.  To move into another room, I simply unplug it, move, plug it back in and keep going.  The weight is where it should be, on top of the pad.  It cleans so well, for tougher stains just keep it steaming on that spot.  In fact, it's cleaning the spots up that the others couldn't get!  The pads are thick and easily tossed in the wash.  The floor is clean, not wet which is great since I have two dogs.  My white tile floor just sparkles and I know its clean because of the steam.  I also like that fact that there are no chemicals.  <br /><br />Just vacuum, then use the Enviro Steamer.  You'll never buy any other type of mop again, EVER!  I promise!  This is the best product for steam cleaning floors at a great price.  (I paid $100 ten years ago for this.) <br />TRY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!<br />

Look no further for a easy way to clean hardwood, tile or laminate
This is a well built product. It's structure and tank are similar to my professional garment steamer.  I have no doubt that this product will last a long time due to the simplicity of construction. I have 1800 sq ft of hardwood, tile and laminate.  It does great on all 3. My floors haven't been this clean since they were installed. I have a 3 year old boy and here is a list of things the steamer has gotten off my floor easily.  I don't know what this says about our cleanliness, but here goes: <br />* dried soda pop<br />* partially eaten candy peppermint dried to the floor in a puddle of what must have been saliva, that previously would only have come off with a scraper or hours of soaking in standing water (not good for hardwood)<br />* smashed and dried brownies<br />* smashed and dried Reese's peanut butter cups<br />* overspray from acrylic airbrush paint that has been there for at least 5 years<br />* dripped candle wax, a total surprise, it took about 10 seconds<br />* a host of various other unidentified sticky and gooey spots<br />Things it took more effort to remove:<br />* glue residue from items such as bandaids, duct tape and double sided foam sticky tape<br />Things it will not remove no matter how much you try:<br />* hot glue<br />* dried paint, it will get thin swipes, but not drips<br /><br />PRO's: light weight, all of the weight is on the floor, pads are thick and clean larger area than Swiffer products and do a better job of it, which makes it more economical and environmentally friendly,  EASY to use, less scrubbing, will fit underneath bed, work on/off switch with your foot, stands by itself, <br /><br />CON's: only 15 minutes of steam per fill up, head is too big to fit under toe kick of cabinets or sofa, but I had to move it before so no loss there<br /><br />If I had known these things were this easy, I would have gotten one years ago.  The only thing that would make it more perfect would be if someone else would do it for me.

Finally, a great little steam mop!
I have been reading about all the different steam mops and their pros and cons.  I decided on the enviro and I am so glad I did.  First... no whimpy pad here, this baby is thick and durable and really easy to put on and take off. It didn't 'soak' the floor as long as you keep it moving.  I did a kitchen, family room laundry and 3 bathrooms with 2 refills and without changing the pad.  It heats up in 3 minutes, the cord is fine, I just unplugged and plugged it in from room to room.  The cloth really picks up dirt and I just threw it in the wash with some car towels and let it air dry.  This cloth is so heavy duty, you will not need to buy replacements.  The machine will wear out before the pads do. Buy this one, it's a great price and you will not be disappointed. <br />E. Coniglio, Tamp, FL

A great appliance
I've thought about getting a steam mop for awhile but whenever I read up on them, there were more complaints than raves.  Read about this one on several sites and it seemed univerally loved.  I can see why: it does a great job and does it quickly.  The floors get really clean; you can see it on the pad.  This is prob. the best feature: large,heavy duty, thick, waffle weave pads.  It came with two and I ordered an extra.  I have about 1000 sq. feet of wood floors and 3 tiled baths/laundry room.   With three kids and three pets, my floors get really dirty.  A great product.

Best floor cleaner ever!
I am so happy with this product! I have vinyl floors and I never really felt that I could get them clean. We have 3 young kids so we have lots of spills, muddy footprints, etc. Over the years there has been dirt buildup and in our bathroom, hair product build up on the floors. I have a Hoover Floor Mate which was heavy, messy, and didn't seem to get the sticky spots up without a lot of work on my part. I then got a Swiffer Wet Jet and I liked this because it was light weight and easy to use. But I was still scrubbing the tough spots by hand. And- the chemicals left the floor sticky. I like the idea that the Enviro Steamer only used water and the pads were reuseable. I had it put together and working in minutes and boy, did it work well! For the bad spots, I just left it steam over those areas a little longer and my floors never looked so clean!! And for the hairspray buildup in the bathroom- this is the first thing I have used that could even touch it- it took a couple of times of going over the floors to get the years of build up off. But it did the job. I am so happy that I got this. It is sooooo worth the money!!!

The BEST steamer!!
This is a great way to clean hard floors! I've used the Shark steamer before, and I was pretty happy with it. Then, I used this Eureka steamer and had a whole new appreciation for steaming. Here are some great points:<br /><br />1. It has a larger water well. I only had to stop to add water once and steamed my large front room, kitchen, and bath. Our kitchen is medium-sized, but that is still an impressive amount of cleaning on only two tanks of water.<br />2. The head of the steamer swivels so you can go through intricate alcoves and corners and gather any dirt deposits that form under the steam.<br />3. It has constant steam and doesn't leave water spots. It is essential to let the steamer warm up (~3 minutes.) You'll know when it's ready because of all the steam that starts coming out of it when it's still in the holding mat.<br />4. You can hold it on a tough spot for ~15 seconds and it will be instantly gone. The shark is designed so that you push down on the long handle to get spurts of steam. Whereas, Eureka is constantly steaming. So, instead of spurts of steam, you just hold it in one place to really work out the stains or dirt marks - this is just as, if not MORE effective!<br /><br />Like I said, I'm hooked on steaming. NO CHEMICALS and my hard wood has never shined like this. And, I'm someone who before is on hands and knees cleaning with Murphy's Oil.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT!

Great Steam Mop!!
I just got my new Enviro Steamer and I really love it!  I have been looking on-line comparing steam mops for the past 6 months and I finally decided on this one because of the reviews and price.  It hasn't disappointed me!  The steam works great and the mop pads are really heavy duty.  Because it's so easy to attach the mop pads to the base, if I ever needed another mop pad to finish up a job I could easily just attach one of my own wash cloths or towels.  The swivel handle works great and the base fits under all of my cabinets.  I have a 4 year old house and there was putty and other stuff stuck on my tile floor since I moved in and I have never been able to remove it.  Today it is gone thanks to the Enviro Steamer!  The steam softened it up and I was able to easily scrape it off with a knife blade.  The hair spray build-up in the bathroom is gone and the floors are shiny clean.  I am very happy!  You can trust the 5 star reviews!  This is great!

glad the Enviro Steamer is back!
Many years ago, I owned an Enviro Steamer when it was actually made by Eureka and adored it! Best appliance I ever owned. By the time mine finally wore out, however, it was no longer on the market hence I couldn't get a replacement.  So I was thrilled to find it back in production via Electrolux and bought it immediately.  My first "outing" with the new Enviro Steamer was a disaster, however, with bubbling, leaking and painfully slow drying!  Then I realized that the culprit was ME...not the Steamer.  I had over-filled the tank, something I regularly did on my original appliance without ill effect, but which one CANNOT do with the new Enviro Steamer.  I now fill the tank only to the prescribed level and it works like a dream.   Happy to recommend the Enviro Steamer to anyone who wants super-clean tile with minimum effort.

Eureka Magic Pads?
I have only one complaint about this product, I have spent several hours trying to purchase extra magic pads. after hours on line I only found one place to purchase these pads with out paying an outrageous price. You can purchase them directly from eureka at a price of 19.00 for two pads plus 7.00 shipping. The part # is 60978, I would suggest ordering 2 sets because the shipping is the same either way. Here is the contact enfo: <br />Customer Service Department at 1-800-282-2886 (8 a.m. - 7:30 CST Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.- 6:30 p.m. CST Saturday-Sunday). <br /><br />Happy steaming

I love this thing!
I just received my mop today but I already know I am going to love it as long as it works like it did today and I have NO reason to believe it won't do so for time to come.<br /><br />Let's see.... the pads are great like others have said. It works JUST like other steam cleaning products I have been used but has been smartly reconfigured to work best on floors, go figure.<br /><br />The handle is comfortable.  The unit isn't heavy and is easy to push around on the floor.  I didn't feel like I needed to scrub or put lots of pressure ever.  Knowing it was coming I had purposely NOT cleaned many spills and just let them dry on the floor.<br /><br />I have SIX kids so the floor was absolutely FILTHY when I opened the box, assembled the unit (that took all of about two minutes, really) and mopped.  That poor pad was filthy by the time I was done and my floor was pretty.<br /><br />Someone else complained that you need to hold the mop in one place for a full 15 seconds to sanitize... not true.  The instructions say to hold 8 seconds but no more than 15.  I have 12" tiles and used this in my combo kitchen/dining about 200+ sq ft.  Took me under 15 mins to do the entire floor.  Grout was never sealed after the home was built and I haven't had a chance to really clean it after moving in but I am definitely SOLD on this mop and can't imagine ever going back to another way of cleaning floors.  I am happy I chose this over the Shark as it is much better made.... to last.

The best solution I've tried
I've owned the older white model for over a year now - the old terry pads didn't bother me as far as shrinking went, but I sure wore holes in them.   The new microfiber pads are a nice improvement, easier to get on and off, and appear to be more durable.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of this product and was very disappointed when Bissell appeared to discontinue it - I've wanted to purchase one for my mother and mother in law.<br /><br />So, for the review:<br /><br />Nothing cleans your floor better than good old fashioned Cinderella-style scrubbing.  But given that I have around 1800 square feet of hard flooring, three kids, and four dogs - my knees just can't take that kind of torture cleaning something that is just going to be spilled on, puked on, or smeared with banana in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />I have tried all the other leading brands of hard floor cleaners, and this one is by far the simplest to use and does a decent enough job that it's a regular in my household cleaning routine.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Uses nothing but water.  No chemicals, no expensive solutions.  I do purchase distilled since we have hard well water and the filter on my old model hasn't needed replacing.<br /><br />- Cleans my ceramic tile and bamboo floor quickly and effectively.  The water dries very quickly.  My tile never looks streaky, but the bamboo flooring does a bit.<br /><br />- Piece of cake clean up.  Toss the mop head pad into the laundry, wrap the cord up and you're done.  Small and compact, easy to store.<br /><br />- It's very quiet.  I can clean after my kids are in bed and the soft steaming noise wouldn't bother even the lightest sleeper.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The cord really is too darn short, but I've remedied that with an extension cord.<br /><br />- It's a little short for me.  This gripe isn't very fair because EVERY mop, broom, and vacuum are too short for me (except for the Dyson) - I'm tall.  But I will mention here that short women aren't the only people who clean!  My 5'10" self and my 6'3" husband both have to hunch over to mop the floor with this.  It'd be lovely if the handle could extend.<br /><br />- Doesn't do a great job on grout - but nothing does.  I've decided I just hate tile and grout period.<br /><br />- It does take some effort to push, but cleans overall more quickly than the Powered Floormate.<br /><br />- Like any machine it can't get right up close to the walls and though it's mophead fits under the cabinets, it simply cannot clean right in the crack where the floor meets.  So every so often I have to get down and hand scrub those areas.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Highly, highly recommend for regular use.  Does a great job at steaming the dried on grime and gunk my kids regularly paste the house with.  <br /><br />

Throw your old mop away!
The cleaning power of this mop can't be beat.  The swivel head makes it easy to get around table legs and toilets, and it gives you the peace of mind that the floor is not just clean, it's sanitized with no chemicals.<br /><br />It's ready almost immediately once plugged in, and you have steam control at the touch of a finger.  At first, I was surprised that there was no on/off switch, but the unit is essentially "off" until you call for steam.  Pressing the steam button turns it "on."<br /><br />The easy to fill reservoir slides effortlessly into place, and the thick, absorbent mop heads are easy to attach.  Just throw them in the wash, and they clean up like new.  Also, you don't have to move in slow motion like with some steam mops, as the entire mop head stays firmly planted on the floor, even with some speed.<br /><br />This is the best steam mop I have found.  I have had no problem with my sealed hardwood oak floors, and it did great on my tile.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />[Update 4/20/08: The cord on this mop has turned out to be rather short.  However, this is a minor annoyance as we are still more than satisfied with its cleaning power.  Tip for keeping the mop heads coming out of the wash like new: order several extra mop heads, and don't let them get overly soiled before changing to a fresh one.  Several would be needed to do an entire house.]

A great time saver
I purchased this item a couple months ago when I moved into a new residence. The floors throughout are Pergo wood grain. I was surprised at the dirt that came off of a floor that was supposed to have been cleaned when I moved in. I am able to get right to the base boards and the mop head rotates all the way around to get into tight spaces. I still have to wipe the corners by hand...but that's minor compared to the hands and knees scrubbing I'd be doing otherwise. I haven't had a problem with the floors getting too wet and they dry in minutes. A major plus - the steam mop uses no chemicals to clean so I don't have to worry about my pets ingesting anything harmful.<br /><br />The mop came with two pads that wash up easily enough, but I would recommend getting an extra set or two. I'd like to see the pads a bit thicker as the texture of the floor has worn holes in a couple of them, but I'm guessing they will last a lot longer on a smooth surface.<br /><br />P.S. - I've found that adding a little vinegar to the water once in a while also freshens the air as it cleans and helps eliminate streaking.<br /><br />*Update: After two years of almost weekly use the mop died. It stopped emitting steam. I performed all of the trouble shooting suggestions, but nothing worked. I contacted Bissell Customer Service, which was useless as the people I spoke with didn't understand and spoke very poor English.<br /><br />Overall I still think this is a great product and ordered a replacement unit. I was spending as much money on cleaning products over two years as this item costs on Amazon, so it evens out. The weekend hours alone that I've saved using this product make a second purchase worth it.

The last mop you ever have to buy...
Ok,  I admit I'm a neat freak already...but honestly I was tired of spending so much money on refills dry and wet for Swiffers...and regular mops were so much work and just mopped the dirt back and forth, I couldn't win either way.  Finally I tried this....no chemicals - great for you and the economy (and if you have kids!), it's done quick (after one mop thru), it drys quick (no waiting), and it's ULTRA-CLEAN afterwards!  Squeaky clean.  Seriously you could eat off your floor.  <br />Keep in mind however, this will not work as good if you hardly ever clean your floor and have dust and debris sitting all over it.  You have to be somewhat clean and pick up normal stuff (don't expect it to suck up anything as that's not what it's meant to do).  But this works great....you try it once, it almost becomes addicting to clean your floors.  I definitely recommend to everyone!

Great floor cleaner
I have linoleum flooring that never looked really clean - even after I would get down on my hands and knees and scrub. This mop totally got rid of the residue/buildup and the flooring looks new. I highly recommend it!

I really like this product.
Great product.  It does take 2 or 3 times before it functions all the way perfectly - don't give up on it too soon, try it again, and then again a few days later.  I think the water has to get all through the channels.  After the second time it really worked great.  Yay.

I love this steam mop!
I've had my Bissell Steam Mop for about a month, now, and I truly love it.  I have 11 cats and 1 dog, plus I live in the Sierra Foothills.  Needless to say, the animals and the humans in the household can track in a lot of dirt, especially during the winter months.  This product is so easy to use, and because the steam is so hot, the moisture dries very quickly, leaving no residue or streaks.  A reviewer who wrote a one-star review had mentioned that the water took forever to dry.  I have never found that to be the case at all.  For me, it's been quite the opposite.<br /><br />I think the strongest asset of this product is that the steam penetrates the dirt and grunge on the floor, and loosens it, unlike a regular sponge or string mop.  This makes for a very easy clean-up.  <br /><br />I used to absolutely hate having to get the mop out and go through the constant wiping/wringing process.  Using this steam mop has made the job so much easier.  I know this may sound a little crazy, but I don't mind washing the hard-floor surfaces in my house, now.  I actually kind of enjoy it.<br /><br />The only down side to this steam mop is that I think the cord is too short.  However, moving the plug to a more convenient location is a small price to pay, compared to the overall results.  I honestly can't complain.

Pleasantly surprised
I relay heavily on other's opinions and thought that the bissell steam mop had the highest user ratings.  However, I was still skeptical at how well it would actually work.  My entire house is tile, except for the bedrooms, and I bemoan the fact that I must vacuum then mop the floor every week.  It usually takes over an hour - time I don't have.  So, I am always looking for an easier way. <br /><br />Well, I found it.  The system is so easy!  Really!  All you have to do is put the water in - wait 15 second and presto you're on your way to a clean floor.  No buckets, no wringing the mop, no dirty water to be changed.  Now granted I have three kids under five and a dog so my floors are never, ever clean.  So for the first cleaning I held down the steam button for the entire floor.  And then dried it with a towel.  But, the second cleaning I only used the steam about half the time and the floor dried quickly and relatively streak free.  <br /><br />Now the mop cloth does become saturated if you have a large area to clean, so you might want to switch it out half way through.  I ordered extra mop cloths for this very reason.  However, they are very easy to put on - you just have to wait for them to cool off a little.<br /><br />Pros - easy to use, much quicker than mopping, can easily get under cabinets and other low furniture, chemical free, does an amazing job cleaning, quiet enough to use when the kids are sleeping, easy to use for quick clean up jobs<br /><br />Cons -  it probably cleans almost too well - now I can see where the grout wasn't cleaned off well enough when the tile was laid.  Also, the mop cloths could be a little more durable.  There are several small holes in the one (it might be because I pushed down on the mop too hard the first time I used it, because there are only holes in that one mop cloth - I've since found that it cleans just as well without pushing down on it)<br />However, it still cleans like a champ! <br />Highly recommend!

Great Bissell Steam Mop!
This mop is FABULOUS on ceramic tile.  It cleans and dries with no spots or streaks.  I ordered an extra set of mop covers so I can keep cleaning until the job is complete.  With only one carpeted room in the house, this is a timesaver!  Thanks!

Absolutely amazing!!!
Wow!!!  It makes such a difference!  We ordered this item because it is perfect for the environment as well as great because we have mostly hard floors (laminate & tile)  We were tired of sticky cleaners & mops that left streaks & footprints but never really got the floor clean.  <br /><br />It's so easy to do & it worked wonders on our floors.  I will say you should vacuum/swift very well beforehand, but we have only used the Bissell once (It just arrived yesterday).  It's great that it comes with 2 pads, but they get dirty really quick, I'm sure the more we steam the less dirty the floor will be, but maybe getting more pads would be a good idea.  I believe they suggest 1 pad per room, which would have made it easier.  As others have stated the cord is a bit on the short side, but thats what extension cords are for.  Other than that we love it!  We'll probably have to replace the filter more often as we have really hard water, I do try to use the fridges filtered water.  We love it's a great replacement for those old dirt collecting mops.

Bissell 1867-7 Steam Mop
This mop is absolutely wonderful! I've never cared for mops because they don't get the corners and edges to my satisfaction, so I've spent a lifetime on hands and knees.  The Bissell mop is unlike any other.  It does an excellent job...even in tight corners in the bathroom! The terry cloth mop cover wraps up and around the mop head, so even the edges get clean. The mop cover is sturdy and durable...just toss it in the laundry and it's fresh and clean for the next use. They even include a spare! Unlike other mops that use disposable mop covers, future costs on this one are minimal.  These are heavy duty mop covers, so I suspect they'll last at least a year.  Nearly my entire first floor is ceramic tile, so I used to spend 30-45 minutes washing the floor.  I can now sail through it in 10 minutes...making it easy to do a quick clean mid-week if I want to.  I would not recommend this for wood floors; it would get too wet and would result in warping the wood over time. Ideal for ceramic, marble, or vinyl, though. This was the best investment I've made in a long time! It's constructed of good quality materials (not flimsy and breakable), yet very lightweight so that using it is not a chore. This is my first Bissell product, so I'm very impressed.

wonderful
I have used the bissell steam mops for 3 years now.  I upgraded to this one because of the hard water we have here in Florida, which destroyed the older version.  The microfiber pads are also a huge improvement.  You will love this mop! I never have to use chemicals.  I used to use it to clean my laminate floors, now I have tile floors throughout my house and it works great on both.

If you have tile, throw your mops away
I have a TON of tile in my house.  Mopping takes forever and is, quite frankly, just gross.  The Swiffer Wet Jet goes through too many pads and solution.  Both are a task and a half, and the floors are left streaky and dull.<br /><br />This item was on back order when I placed my order.  First it was for 3-4 weeks, then 5-6.  I almost canceled, but realized that Amazon.com had the best price going, and since I was still Swiffering and mopping, I wasn't going to do anything different if I did cancel because ordering it any other place would cost me more than double without the cost of shipping.<br /><br />It arrived a week ago and I am so impressed.  I had read the reviews about the "short cord", and have to say that it isn't that short, but not quite long.  No big deal.  Invest in a grounded extension cord and this will not be a problem at all.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends distilled water for most efficient steam production, and better filter performance.  We have very hard water, so I decided to spend the buck on a gallon of distilled water.  Given how much you spend on cleaners in general, it's not much.  You will be surprised at the size of the water tank on the Green Tea.  You will also be surprised at how far that small tank of water goes.  It doesn't take much to do a lot - I've yet to use a full tank on my entire downstairs floor (this includes 2 regular bathrooms, a master suite bathroom, kitchen, dining, entry, foyer and laundry room).  I am most happy about the fact that I will never have to buy or smell Mr. Clean, Pine Sol, and/or Lysol again.  Oh, the savings =)  A gallon of water will last well over a month, if not 6 weeks.<br /><br />This little thing heats up in minutes, and goes the distance.  No streaks, no chemicals, and no headache.  The chenille pads are soft, absorbent and easy to change.  The steam is uber-hot and dissolves grime, dirt and all the other sticky stuff that finds itself onto a kitchen floor in seconds.  Best of all, it weighs next to nothing, and pivots well (it reaches behind my toilets with ease).  When I mop now, it literally takes 15 minutes or less, and there's no mess to clean up when I am done.  I just remove the pad, wrap the cord and store the steam mop.<br /><br />This has been a blessing.  This task is no longer a chore for me, and I don't mind "mopping" a few times a week now.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has lots of tile (I already have), and not a lot of time to mop.  If you have kids and dogs, this is a dream.  (Did I mention how quiet it is?)<br /><br /><br />P.S.  You can order the replacement filters and chenille pads directly from Bissell.  The cost (and the shipping) is far less than any e-tailer, even the one who sells through amazon.com. If you have  a lot to mop, you will need to change the pad when it accumulates enough dirt and gets too wet, or it will begin to streak.  Again, it takes seconds and is easy and painless.  (All other parts and accessories for this machine are also at bissel.com for much less, too.)<br />

40 years of floor cleaning, and now Steam!!
OK, I am a 60+ Grandma! I have been obsessed with clean floors thru 40 years of marriage and two kids, three grandkids, and innumerable dogs!! I have no back left after all the mopping and scubbing all those years. I finally tried the Steam Mop after my daughter raved about it, but I was leary. Well, I am finally off my knees, have thrown my dirty wet mop (and swiffers) away and even sent my electric floor cleaner to the Goodwill. This is a wonderful invention. You should feel the squeaky, clean under your bare feet when you are done. This requires no more "mopping" than a floor mop, but glides over the floor with no effort, very light-weight (ask my back) and quiet, heats up quickly, and cleans and sanitizes. The dirty cover goes in the washer and comes out like new. It actually made me want more hard floors insead of carpet to clean! The only cons, which are insignificant compared to old mopping woes, is that you will need to run a paper towel along the joint between the wall and the floor once in awhile (which I can do with my toes, standing up!) and sometimes water marks will show up if you steam too aggressively in one place (again, a paper towel with your toes dries it up). <br />Young homemakers, take if from Mom (Grandma) this is a great invention. I might look ten years younger if I'd had this when I was your age!!

Best Cleaner Ever
This is honestly the best cleaner ever.  I hate washing the floor.  It is quick and easy.  You will see once you use if for the first time how well it works.  I am always shocked how black the pad is after using.  It gets down in the tiles.  LOVE it.  I highly recommend it.

A Monster Cleaner
This little cleaner is awesome!!  And I mean awesome!  I only use it on tile, so keep that in mind, but it does a WONDERFUL job.  The steam powerfully removes dirt and dried on stuff.  I was so impressed the first time I used it and that feeling continues.  There's very little "scrubbing" involved, just pushing - and that's not too hard, though a little harder than a regular mop.  The beauty is that you don't feel like you're pushing dirt around the floor like you do with a regular mop.  It really seems to come up and stick to the microfiber cloth (I always vacuum before mopping too).  I even did a paper towel test on a section of tile that I'd mopped with the Monster - no dirt on the paper towel.  Now that's impressive.  It does take about 5 minutes to heat up when filled with cold water, the handle is a little flimsy for my taste, and yes, it doesn't reach all the way under cabinets because of the way it's designed, but the cleaning power outweighs any of these issues.  Hope this helps someone make a great decision.  A clean floor with little effort and no choking chemicals.  You can't beat that.

Monster EZ1 Steam Mop Review

<!-- BOUNDARY -->
4.5 stars - A great hard floor steamer
This is the 3rd floor steamer I have owned.  The first was a Eureka Enviro-steamer - had it for several years and loved it - then it broke.  They don't seem to make them anymore.  Next I bought a  Lysol steam-mop.  Don't bother.  It's a glorified Swiffer.  Flimsy, water us barely hot - not really steam, very short cord, and every time I filled it it would promptly relieve itself on the floor.  Junk.<br /><br />Then I bought the Monster.  It's very much like the Enviro-steamer.  Light comes on when steam is ready.  Cool feature is that the steam only comes out when you lower the handle.  Steam is hot and does a great job on my tile floors.  The cord is longer than most other steamers.  The water heats in just a few minutes and I can steam about 1500 sf of tile in 2 fills of the tank - and steaming is way faster than mopping.  Yes - you do have to vacuum or sweep first.  This isn't meant to pick up debris.  And yes - there is a 'steamy' scent as you mop - but it goes away pretty quickly.  <br /><br />The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is supposed to do light steam cleaning on carpets too (with the sledge) but it did nothing on my carpets and it doesn't get under the cabinets too well due to the height of the boiler.  Oh well.  Minor stuff for an overall great floor cleaner.

Iffy purchase
UPDATE: Below is my original review to which I assigned a 5 star rating. Since then, the 1 yr old mop has gone on the fritz and now has stopped working completely. I always used distilled water (as recommended by the manual), but after about 6 months or so I started experiencing issues that usually occur when you've used hard water -- i.e., the mope would heat up, but no steam would come out. I read the manual, which very technically explained that I needed to fill up the mop with water (not plug it in), shake the mop violently, and then dump out the water out. I did this, and gray water came pouring out. I repeated the process and then the mop worked like new....until a couple months later when the same phenomenon happened - I remedied it again. I emailed customer service and they never replied. Now, about 1 yr after the purchase my steam mop heats up but no steam comes out and the violent shaking of yesteryear does not work. I'm frustrated and wish I would have gone with a more recognizable brand. I borrowed my mother-in-law's Shark and think I will get one of those. While the water chamber is about half the size of the Monster, the chamber is plastic and you can see if you are getting any funky buildup. Also, the Shark is about half the weight and allows more steam to come out. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I researched for weeks online and in stores for a steam mop, as most of my house is wood or tile. I could not be happier with my purchase. Here are the reasons why i finally chose the Euroflex Monster:<br /><br />1) It was actually designed to be used on hardwood floors - this was important to me b/c I didn't want to ruin the floors in our house<br />2) It has 2 different steam levels, which makes it safer and more effective at cleaning tile and hardwood. i could not find any other steam mop w/ 2 different steam levels.<br />3) it has a good sized water chamber. i can mop the whole house on one filling if i don't press the trigger too much to get extra steam to come out the front.<br />4) steam jets on the bottom AND front. i don't remember seeing this in any other brand.<br />5) it heats up hotter than most steam mops - to 240 degrees F. Other steam mops don't get as hot so to actually sanitize you are supposed to hold the mop in one spot for 15 seconds, which would make mopping a house an all day event. <br />6) it also has an attachment for steam cleaning carpets - i have not tried this yet, but liked the feature.<br /><br />It has been great at cleaning well and quickly. It really does wipe away grime... even grime that's been there for a while. The pads are machine washable and come out clean every time. Be sure to use distilled water so that you don't get any build up in the chamber (that goes for all steam mops). My only complaint is that if you do have to refill the water chamber mid-cleaning session, you have to wait to 5 mins unscrew the cap (b/c of steam escaping when you unscrew the cap)and then another 5 mins for the mop to heat up after you put more water in the chamber.

Very happy with my purchase!
I'd been wanting to purchase a steam mop for over a year, and I finally plunked down the money for this one.  I'm very pleased with it!  I was amazed at the amount of dirt that it removed from my kitchen floor, especially.  That floor is textured linoleum stick-on tiles that are supposed to look like slate.  Anyway, dirt tends to get trapped in the grooves, and it's very hard to remove.  I was a little worried that the high level of heat would ruin the adhesive and lift the tiles, but that hasn't happened after several moppings.  I had even scrubbed that floor on hands and knees with a magic eraser about a week before I bought my Monster, and yet there was more dirt remaining than I thought possible.  Now, I can even walk around barefoot and my feet stay clean.  My other floors are made of ceramic tiles, laminate, and linoleum.  It has cleaned all of them equally well.  I was a little leery about using the Monster on the laminate floors, but I just put it on the lowest setting and they are spotless and no worse for the wear.  It should be noted though, that my laminate floors are glueless, so your mileage may vary if yours are glued together.  This mop is super easy to use and what's more, it's fun!  I've never had such clean floors, period.  And with relatively little effort!  Even my six year old had to try it out.  Picking up her toys is another matter, but who wouldn't want to try blasting a floor clean with this thing?  I also like the trigger on the handle that sends out a blast of steam--it's nice to blast around the base of the toilets, under the fridge, in corners, etc.  I feel like this mop will be pretty durable too--there doesn't seem to be a whole lot that could go wrong with it.  After all, steam irons last forever (my mom still uses one she inherited from her mother, daily, because she sews) and this is basically an iron on a stick.  Overall, just a great, chemical free way to get your home really clean.

MONSTER STEAM MOP
I love this steam mop!  After watching an infomercial for another steam mop, I started researching reviews and after watching a video on how to operate this one I chose it.  This one does not seem to have the problems of others.  It does not leave the floor soaking wet, and it heats up quickly.  It also has a very long cord.  I have marble, granite, hardwood, and laminate floors, and it did a great job on all of them.  It does not make them "shine" but does clean them well.  I found it even removed gum and paint.  I have 3 teenagers and 2 dogs and this is the first mop that actually cleaned all the grim and dirt away. Get this mop, you will not be disappointed!!!  I bought mine from GOvacuum and got free shipping for around $106 and received it in a couple of days from placing my order with Amazon.

Better than I expected
This product is great.  I researched steam mops for weeks and finally decided on this one.  I've had it for about a month and am very satisfied.  It is very easy to use and does a great job cleaning up everyday dirt and also gunk stuck to the floor from 3 small children who spill everywhere!  I am using this mop about 2 times a week and I just feel that my house is so much cleaner.  I don't have time to spend 2 hours on my hands and knees cleaning my floor all the time, so I would let it go.  This thing takes about 20 minutes to clean my hardwood floors.  I find that it does not leave streaks on my wood floors either (they are lighter in color).  I have to stop and fill the tank again in order to clean my whole first floor, but it still only takes 20 minutes and it is a fairly large space that I am cleaning.

Love the Monster
I received my refurbished Monster EZ1 by UPS three days ago. It was shipped promptly and in new condition. I have only tile floors and they were very dirty because we live on a farm. I have two kids under two so I hate to use chemicals.  I love this steamer. It appears to be made very well. Nothing is flimsy.  I turned the steam on high and it easily cleaned up everything: dried on food, dirt and even black mold that was growing under the toy box. Now my whole floor is cleaner than it ever got with a mop and bucket. The best part is that it is so quiet I can clean while my husband is working and the kids are sleeping. The floor dries almost instantly so I don't have to mop and then leave the house. I find it far easier to push than my mop and I don't have to carry around a bucket of water. I am 5'8" and the handle is plenty long. I have a very bad back and this is not a problem for me to use this mop. I would highly recommend this steam mop.

Monster EZ1 Steam Mop Review
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZHIW2">Monster Floor EZ1 Steam Mop and Floor Cleaner, 1000W</a><br />This is the 3rd steam mop that I have purchased.  1st purchased the Haan which was good, but the cord was not long enough so I gave it to my daughter who lives in an apartment.  2nd was the Bissell steam mop which put out way to much steam creating too much water on the floor.  It also started leaking and I didn't like the cleaning pads.  The Monster Steam Mop is just perfect to me.  Nice long cord and the water heats very quickly and just the right amount of steam which allows the floors to dry very quickly.  I love it and would highly recommend it.

OMG - what a fantastic product
Throw away your mops - wow = this is a superior product.  <br /><br />I tried the Bissel Steam Mop "Green Tea" - which left the kitchen floor so wet,it couldn't be walked on for an hour. It was returned the next day!<br /><br />The Monster Floor EZ1 Steam Mop and Floor Cleaner is POWERFUL - press the handle trigger/lever and it emits steam through the front nozzles.  I don't think there is another brand of steam mop that provides both bottom and front steam emission. <br /><br />The "Monster" heats up quickly (less than 5 minutes). It does not emit steam unless you tilt the handle downwards toward you.  The cord is extra long with "hooks" on the handle for winding it.  The only thing better would be a "retractable" cord - (I'm dreaming!) <br /><br />The Monster Customer Service folks are top notch, with a wealth of knowledge about their products. <br /><br />Select this above the others on the market and you will be glad you did.<br /><br /><br /> <br />

Works well!
I purchased this steamer about 8 months ago. I does a good a job. I have a lot of hardwood floors, including in the kitchen and it cleans up the typical stuff around the stove, dishwasher and sink. Works well on hard surfaces like tile or laminate flooring. It does not clean the mortar on tile. Have not really tried it on carpet. On hardwood some effort is required as the damp pad tends have more resistance on wood than with tile or other surfaces. The steamer takes about 5 minutes to heat up.<br /><br />I bought the Monster unit over others based on reviews and what appears to be better overall construction, except as noted below.<br /><br />The handle on the unit I purchased broke in the middle this weekend. It was very difficult to keep the top and bottom parts screwes together tightly. I called the customer service number - 888-896-8786 - and they offered to send a new, redesigned handle. Apparently if the lower part of your handle is curved it is more prone to snapping in the middle. They explained they have had numerous complaints like mine. The new handle with instructions is suppose to arrive later this week, free of charge.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the new handle today, one week from the dat I call the distributor. Unlike the original handle which was curved and screwed together in the middle, the new handle is straight and is a telescoping "one piece" design. The metal used seems to be a little heavier as well. I tried it out briefly and the new design seems to overcome the problem with the original which was screwed together in the middle. The old one would become loose where it came together and eventually snapped from the back and forth movement and pressure. The new one does not become "loose" and doesn't flex. Much better. If you have the old handle and it hasn't broken yet do yourself a favor and call to get the new one.

I'm in love....
We moved into a house with lots of tile and wood, and after a year of avoiding cleaning my floors because of the time and effort involved and being embarrassed by the dirt on my feet and socks, I decided it was time to look for a solution. I started researching steam mops, largely because we have also started going green and it seemed the perfect solution. I started with the Shark, and the reviews were awful regarding the sturdiness of the handle. Then I looked at some of the cheaper models available in the big box stores, and again, reviews were not that great. Reviews were best for the Haan and the Monster, so I started focusing there. Coincidentally, my neighbor called to tell me that Big Lots had Sharks on sale and she was getting one for her daughter in law because she loved hers, did I want one? I said "no", but can I give yours a test run? Being a good neighbor, she said yes. I must tell you, I loved that stinking mop. It made my floors so clean and took a fraction of the time. I wavered between going ahead with the Shark (she'd had hers a year with no problems) and the Monster, but I found a good deal here on Amazon and opted to go with the Monster. I am so happy I did! The Monster is SOOOOOOOO much easier to push than the Shark. Also, the pad, hence cleaning surface, is much bigger. I also liked the steam jets for use around the toilet and shower alot. The psychological thrill I get about that super hot steam blasting my 2 boys toilet is significant.... The steam jets are also good for getting stuck items off. The aim takes a little practice, but a couple of blasts have been all I needed for most problem areas. Shark heats up much faster, but doesn't hold as much water or get as hot as the Monster. I wouldn't say that the handle is rock solid on the Monster, but all the reviews I've read on many sites seem to indicate that it's not nearly the problem it is with the Shark. I've only found one that said it actually broke whereas the Shark reviews I read complained consistently about it breaking. The Haan seems to be a good brand too, but I liked the look of the Monster better, so that's the direction I went. Honestly, if I'd never heard of the Monster and had only used the Shark, I would have been totally happy to use it over mopping. However, now that I've used both, I have to say the Monster beats the Shark hands down. I do not plan to use this on carpets as it does not seem to be a good solution. Why would I steam my carpets with no suction? Maybe it's a European thing. However, as a solution for hard surfaces, and in reference to my 2 kids, I yell from the mountaintops.....I LOVE THIS MONSTER!<br />

Good Bye Mop!
I love my new Monster.  I have about 2000sq ft of tile in my house and used to spend 2 or more hours mopping my floors.  Now my floor cleaning time is cut in half, plus my back does not kill me afterwards.  <br />I had been looking at buying a steam mop when a friend of mine said she had bought the Monster and loved it.  So I looked at the reviews on Amazon and decided to go ahead and purchase the Monster.  The Monster does all the work for you.  The steam does a great job of cleaning.  The first time I used the Monster I thought this was too easy and must not being doing that great of a job.  When I finished I took a Clorox wipe and wiped it over a tile to see if it was clean.  The wipe came up clean.  The Monster really works.  <br />For the reviews that say the handle is flimsy, the first piece of paper that you see in the box has a big X over someone pushing down on the Monster handle and says let the Monster do the work for you.  So if you follow the instructions your handle should not break.  <br />

Great Little Steamer
Was hesitant about steam floor cleaners but gave this one a try and am I glad I did!  It is a no-brainer to use and does a fantastic job.  My Airedale dog seems to have 12 legs with footprints all over and this steamer gets the job done on the first try on my Solarium, tile and hardwood floors.  Sounds weird, but the floors seem to stay cleaner longer.  I love it and have recommended it to all my friends.

Major upgrade for Office
While Office 2003 offered a refreshed look and some improvements in functionality, the basic structure remained the same.  While veteran users were able to easily navigate the familiar menus, it had become increasingly difficult to locate some features (for instance, in Word, would you find "insert new rows" to a table in the "insert" or "table" menu?).  <br /><br />With Office 2007, Microsoft offers the "ribbon", a new and more intuitive way to access features that we used to find in the menus.  While the features are basically the same, they are now grouped together according to when and how you would normally use them.  These groupings are accessed by clicking on tabs, which are organized in the order you'd use them.  The best way to get a better understanding of this change is to check out the screenshots, or download a free trial version of Office from Microsoft.  While Office 2007 was released at the same time as Vista, you do not need Vista in order to run it.  The program ran fine on my Windows XP laptop, which only had 512 MB of RAM, and it runs even better on my Vista laptop with 2 GB of RAM.  <br /><br />As for which version of Office to buy, this is the third time I've opted for the Home and Student version (which has had other names in previous releases, but is still being sold for $149).  I need Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and this is the most cost-effective way to get those programs.  I was disappointed that Microsoft dropped Outlook from the Home and Student version.  In order to continue to use Outlook, I installed Outlook 2003 and haven't had any problems.  <br /><br />Instead of Outlook, you get OneNote, a program that uses notebooks and tabs to save and organize all sorts of files and documents.  I haven't had much time to play with OneNote yet, but the more I use it, the more impressed I am with it.  It looks like one of those programs that you can personalize to meet your own needs and not have to fight with it to get it to do what you want.<br /><br />This is a significant upgrade and should allow all users, new and experienced, to work more efficiently and quickly.

Let's reconcile all those good and bad reviews...
Well, it's been a week now, and while I still have Office 2002 (virtually identical to 2003) and Office 2007 on my laptop, I've pretty much stopped using 2002.  I give '07 a thumbs up.<br /><br />I have used Office since 1994 for just simple letters and spreadsheets until the last year, where I started becoming a heavy user of some really odd features, like non-standard line spacing, different headers within the same document, embedded Excel sheets in a Word doc, embedding images in headers and footers, charting, tables, etc.  I was worried if all these newly discovered features that I just learned would suddenly disappear in the changing ribbon that everyone was talking about.<br /><br />Despite using weird features, or maybe because of it, I am a little more tolerant of looking up how to do things.  But I didn't want to relearn everything, and I haven't had to.  The default blank document has tabs for Home, Insert, Page Layout, References, etc, which really are not much different than the categories in the classic drop-down menus.  Once clicking on these tabs, you are offered the same choices as before...charts, insert picture, bookmarks, wordart, etc., and a few new ones, like references, balloons and highlighting, footnotes, and more.  It IS a different layout, but to this point, I don't think it ever took me more than 10 seconds to find something.<br /><br />I'm surprised no one is talking about the ability to save documents in .pdf (what was once exclusive to Adobe).  I know other software has allowed this for sometime, but the ability to make a document that will launch in Adobe Reader with all the functionality of Word or Excel is something I've been waiting for.  In 2 years, we'll all wonder how we did without it.  This is important to me because once in .pdf, the formatting is locked in, and won't change depending on how it's previewed or printed.<br /><br />Another thing that is important is the new, modern looking charts and tables.  This isn't just the 'pretty' factor, but more effective to understanding lots of data more easily.  Office 2000/2002/2003 just looked old and unimpressive.  It's true that Microsoft is just catching up to Apple, Adobe and others, but they've at least done it.  Equally important is the ability to instantly see changes to formatting before you've committed it to the whole document.  I've probably wasted a month's time over the course of the last year reformatting documents to do it a better way.  If only I authored them in 2007, which was available a year ago, I would have saved so much time.<br /><br />One reviewer said his Home/Student version "did not have all the features as the full version".  I've tried to investigate this, and as far as I can tell, Home/Student's versions of Word/Excel/Powerpoint are no different than any other version.<br /><br />I don't want to get too personal here, but all the reviewers who are angry that their saved homework or important business document was saved in .docx and therefore was not readable by anyone else really are just wanting to be victims.  Office 2007 makes it abundantly clear that you will be saving in .docx, and if you don't want to, you don't have to.  It tells you how and where to save it as a compatible .doc file (or .xls, etc.) and whether you want this as your default setting.  I'm sorry, but if you're a student and you ignore all those messages, I think you're going to have more problems in school than using this version of Office.<br /><br />The Grammar check seems to be improved, catching problems that my Office 2002 did not.  Hot keys like Ctrl K for hyperlinks or Ctrl C to copy all still work.  I'm not sure if they removed others as some reviewers have said, but so far it has not affected me.  The concept of Add-Ins (plugins) is a little bit annoying, as to get certain features like the ability to save .pdf requires you go online and install the add-in.  Then again, this gives Microsoft the ability to add features from time to time (hopefully they'll use it that way - I think a big reason for add-ins is to give Microsoft a way of periodically checking your software to ensure it's legal).  I also like the always-on word count, something that Amazon probably wishes I would use in my reviews.<br /><br />I'm at day 7 and counting, and I don't feel much reason to ever open my Office 2002 again.

Once you get used to it, you'll love Microsoft Office 07
This student edition of Microsoft Office 07 comes with four programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.  Unless you specifically have a need for another Microsoft Office program, this will be more than enough for the average Office user.  You've got all the essentials: a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet (Excel), a slide show creator (PowerPoint), and even a nice program to put all your notes (OneNote).  Home and Student Office 07 version gives you the basic programs at a cheaper price than the other versions of Office.<br /><br />The main difference you'll find between this 07 version and the Microsoft Office 03 is that all the programs now have the "ribbon" instead of being menu-driven.  The ribbon is a much more visual representation of all the features you can use.  All the different tasks are grouped into ribbons; which are divided up into different tabs you can click on.  For example, if you clicked on the "Insert" tab in Word you would find tasks such as "inserting" a header or "inserting" a table.  What this means is that instead of being hidden in menus and submenus, most features now can be found simply by being in the right tab.  This allows you to find some useful features that you might otherwise not have known existed.<br /><br />Everything from Microsoft 03 is there, it just might take awhile to get used to the new layout of things.  There are also a lot of cool new features added in this version, such as easily being able to write complex math equations in Word (it was such a pain in Word 03) and being provided with an easy format to create a bibliography in APA, MLA, Chicago style etc.<br /><br />Perhaps the only drawback of Office 07 is that it's such a drastic change from Office 03 that it will take awhile to get used to.  After years of knowing all the complex menus you'll have to learn where everything is all over again, which can be frustrating for vetrans of Office 03.  However, if you just give it some time, you'll fall in love with just how well everything is set up and appreciate the new visual style this version implements.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The new visual style allows easy access to all the various features<br />* You can still save files in Office 97-03 format (Example .doc)<br /><br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* You must relearn where everything is because of the Ribbon<br />* Not all websites/ programs recognize the new 07 files<br /><br />Final Recommendation: Buy it, get used to it, and love it!

Not what I expected
I'm a computer tech with a general disdain for Microsoft, although because I'm heavily invested in windows compatible software, my OS of choice is Windows XP.  I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend and then only because the price was reasonable.<br /><br />I have to say Microsoft hit a home-run with this release.  It's full-featured, easy on the eyes, and loaded with readily accessible templates.  True, if you're used to older versions of Office, the orientation is different, but not displeasing.<br /><br />Maybe this is the beginning of a kinder, gentler Microsoft ?

Like it says, &quot;Technology Advice You Can Trust&quot;...
PC World has a Top 100 section which rates and highlights the best home computers, scanners, digicams, power pcs, monitors and laptops and the like for those who make a mental wish list and who love window shopping. It does stories and features like who has the best CD-RW drives and what's included on them, and like which computer store or electronics company has the best customer<br>services...all so the consumer can get the best deals for the best price. The design and graphics are attractive. It also has a nice How To Section, tips on working software and games, internet downloads which make life easier and fuller, and other upgrade info. PC World is a magazine which definitely holds my interest with it's easy to follow reports and down to earth writing style: it also has enough of the technical lingo for those who are 'really' into the technical lingo stuff. However, when the lingo gets a little dense and specific, a thumbnail glossary pops up now and then to help the reader out. It is a good mag if you love your computer, you love anything to do with computers or you want to learn more about computers....

Always relevant; always entertaining and informative
Great magazine for those who are not tech professionals, or who have just started in a tech field, who want to stay on top of the latest products, ideas, and technology news. Good troubleshooting tips for your computer, software programs, and other electronics as well. Loved it so much I decided to order a year's subscription. ***DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON. I ORDERED THE MAG SEPT 7TH AND AS OF DEC 3RD I AM STILL WAITING FOR IT. Amazon is a reliable party, however the subscriptions are outsourced to others. If you have a problem with a subscription order, it is not handled through Amazon.*** UPDATE: Finally received 1st issue in late December and the subscription was backdated to continue through Nov 2006. However, if you want quicker delivery, order a subscription elsewhere.

Excellent magazine for novices and advanced users alike
When I bought PC World at a store, the cover looked appealing. It had an advice on how to surf the Internet trouble free. So I brought it home and started reading it. I was amazed! I have never read a magazine cover to cover before, but I read this one word for word. This mag is filled with tons of reviews of best software and new gadgets. It also has unbiased articles written in a balanced simple English and technical language on computing in general. Perhaps the best part about the magazine is the CD they include with it. iT is filled with PC World recommended software that will make your life much easier.<br /> IF you never heard of PC World, you don't know what you're missing. Go to the nearest store and ask for the copy. You'll be glad you did

Take a look -- a nice resource
PC World is targeted towards the day-to-day Windows user, most likely someone using multiple machines or someone encountering different systems. This is not the best choice to help educate a first-time computer user.<p>However, PC World is a great resource. I've found numerous tips that have saved me time and money, and I find that they offer a nice blend of covering cool gadgets vs. noting the freeware or shareware that you may not hear of elsewhere.<p>I'm a long-time buyer, and now a new subscriber to the magazine--and will be for years to come.

Good quality magazine for the business minded!
For those who have their own business or operate within a company might have some connection with using computers on the job. I own my own web design company and hope to expand to include video production as well. Both job fields include computers to design the websites and to edit the videos or type of the video scripts. The tasks involved are endless and the computer is a time saverr. This magazine helps me stay on top of things with information on the last computer gadgets for the workplace. Such as information about computers that fit my needs in my business. To me this magazine works like a newspaper that informs a citizen of the day's news. Very helpful. I even posted, with permission, some articles from the magazine on my website for refrence purposes of those who visit the site.

Great Magazine!
PC World is my favorite computer magazine. It offers a nice variety of computer related information, product reviews, solutions to problems, helpful tips, and other useful information. It's no wonder why it's one of the few surviving computer magazines still being offered in a printed format. The price is very reasonable so if you happen to encounter an issue that has nothing of interest to you, you aren't likely to complain! I usually read mine and reread it over the course of several months. Much of the advice is helpful when I make a decision regarding the purchase of a new item... often saving much more than the magazine's cost.

Better than all the rest!
I've read a few other gaming magazines but this one is my all time favorite.  I don't want to mention any names, but some magazines read like infomercials written by the company that makes the gaming platform.  Others are just plain boring and dry and they put me to sleep.  PC Gamer is fun and witty and I enjoy reading it from cover to cover.  I've heard others complain that it isn't the magazine it once was, but I have only been a subscriber for about 2 years now and I'm very happy with the quality of the magazine and the writing in general.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:MUCH TO MY DISMAY, PC GAMER IS UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP AND FOR SOME CRAZY REASON, THEY HAVE REMOVED ALL THE WIT, HUMOR AND SARCASAM FROM THE MAGAZINE.  PC GAMER IS NOW AS EXCITING AS STALE WHITE BREAD AND AS ENJOYABLE AS A ROOT CANAL.  I WON'T BE RENEWING MY SUBSCRIPTION AND IF I COULD REVISE MY RATING I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS!  SAVE YOUR MONEY, THERE ARE BETTER GAMING MAGAZINES OUT THERE NOW THAT PC GAMER HAS HAD IT'S SOUL RIPPED OUT!

Everything you expected - plus a bonus
PC Gamer Magazine has been around for many years and continues to maintain currency on all news of interest to gamers.  There are interesting news articles and reviews on current games, plus useful look-aheads at what is coming up in the gaming industry - from technology trends to specific game releases.<br /><br />The bonus is the free disk included with every issue.  Each disk provides free trial versions of current (and often not-yet-released) PC games.  Content sometimes includes additional artwork, videos, and screenshots.<br /><br />My son loved receiving PC Gamer Magazine when he was an early teenager.  It got him up-to-speed on everything his gaming friends wanted to know about.  Now he's a collge graduate working in the computer industry, and he still enjoys this magazine.  My recommended audience for PC Gamer goes beyond the hardcore gaming devotee.  Casual PC gamers interested in knowing what's coming or just talking intelligently with their gaming friends will love this magazine also.  It's worth it just for the bonus disk!

PC Gamer Review
I have been reading this mag for many years now and it never gets old. The reviews save money on game rentals and purchases.  As well, the writers are well versed in gaming and gaming history for the PC.

Solid magazine
I have been reading this mag for 2 years or so.  With it being the only true PC game magazine left I am glad they are keeping it real.  Reviews are always sketchy in any venue.  But I find their opinions interesting.  Even when I don't agree.  They do a fantastic job on keeping me up to date on new hardware.  Don't expect much from the discs.  I have never really gotten anything out of them. But then again I am almost exclusively into FPS.  So that does limit me.

PC Gamer - Best Choice for Gaming News and Reviews
I have been a subscriber to PC Gamer for at least 5 years now.  It is the one magazine I look forward to every month.  I also have gotten Computer Gaming World (now Games for Windows Mag) and in my opinion, it doesn't compare.  <br /><br />Bottom line.... If you are a PC gaming enthusiast, this is a must have!

Concise and well written
This magazine has been on newstands since the days of the PS1.  Now the PS3 has arrove and it is rolling towards the next generation of game play.  I enjoy this magazine quite a bit.  It's not an official Playstation Magazine but that generally keeps the writers from being biased.  I know in general I can always get an honest answer and a good review.  The magazine is a decent price compared to the official magazine which costs twice as much at newsstands just because it offers a demo disc.  I will stay with this magazine to get my news and pics.

Must Have Magazine for PS3 Owners
I have subscribed to Playstation the Official Magazine (PTOM) for nearly a year now.  The writing is solid, the reviews are honest and for the most part unbiased, and there is a wide range of topics to interest almost every type of PS3 owner.  Some examples:<br /><br />Featured Games:  Each month select games are profiled, which includes interviews with the developers, screen shots, ect.<br /><br />Game Reviews:  Games currently available are reviewed and given a rating.  This is extremely helpful it you are undecided about a game or are wondering what to expect.<br /><br />Letters:  Each issues contains a section for reader letters.  Each letter, often containing questions, are answered by the staff.<br /><br />Contests:  Each month there are several contests which can be entered for small prizes.  I entered the contest from the first issue I received and won!  <br /><br />The overall tone of the magazine is one of fun and love of gaming.  If you enjoy your PS3, are interested in upcoming games, or want more information on the latest equipment available, this magazine is a must have!  It is at an affordable subscription price and the money I have saved from avoiding "bust" games means it has already paid for itself.

Great magazine for PS2
This is definately a must buy for every PS2 fan. Great reviews on popular current games, giving strong points and weak points for each reviewed game, previews on popular upcoming games, and some very helpful tips for your more popular games. <br /><br />Note the word "popular" as this magazine will not cover every single game out there. <br /><br />Comical captions here and there also make it a pleasure to read. Throw in the annual swimsuit issue which the previous reviewer mentioned, opinion pages and fan art, and there should be nothing stopping a serious PS2 gamer from subscribing to this magazine.

WICKED FOR HARDCORE GAMERS
this magazine is the best one out there. if your a hardcore ps2 gamer, get this for a year or two. ive gotten this since it was still psone magazine and i have never seen one bad issue. they give you reviews that are %97.9 of the time helpful. you know the're serious 'cause they write down entire levels! PLUS THEY GOT SWIMSUIT ISSUES! a must for the gamer.<br />-XESX

One of the Best Official Video Game Magazines
The PS3 has a very tight knit gaming community.  While the 360 has more people, the PS3 has more devoted fans.  So, it goes without saying that their official magazine will share the same type of close knit community.  The magazine itself is a monthly publication that has what you would expect, reviews, previews, blu-ray movie reviews, etc.  The presentation though is where the magazine really shines.  High glossy pictures, big pages, it looks nice.  Compared to the 360's official magazine (which is also pretty good), it's miles ahead.

If you have a PS3 and a teenager...
I have two PS3s and a teenager so buying this magazine was a no-brainer.  I've been a subscriber since the old days (i.e. PS1).  If you're a parent, you may notice that young people these days don't read too much.  My son reads magazines recreationally.  With PS3 games at $60 each, this is a good investment to see what might intrest you.  BTW: I hate everything made by Ubisoft or Unreal.  (Sorry for the mini rant.)

Item is great. When you get it
This magazine is awesome. I love it. And its cheap.<br /><br />My problem is i ordered this in the middle of july 08 its now middle of october and i have only got 1 magazine. It takes forever to get your first one. My g/f ordered a seperate magazine subscription same time with the same wait time and she got her 3rd one already. So if you can handle waiting a few months to get your first one and just pick up the mag's inbetween at your local store then go for it. <br /><br />when you do get it its soooo worth the wait!

Great magazine
As a PS3 owner, this magazine is awesome. Spot-on reviews, numerous first peeks at upcoming games, and good writing to top it all off. The reviews and previews are very in depth with pictures of things you actually want to see from the game. This magazine covers all aspects of Playstation gaming, from PS2, PSP, PS3, and Playstation Network. It really helps you see every game you can buy for your system.<br /><br />Another perk is that the writers include things other than just games. You can also read interesting reviews of upcoming blu-ray movies and various gadgets.<br /><br />All in all, a perfect magazine for the Playstation gamer. At $1.50 an issue, you can't pass this up.

Hail to the king of playstation magazines
Alrightly. Folks it doesn't get any better than this. This magazine blends humor with serious reviewing. They will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite - like me! Anyhow, I've read this magazine for a while and I've never been disappointed. The "Ask the 800 lbs. Gorilla" section is a riot. The Bottomline gamer this is an unbiased, not corporatly owned (like OPM, and XBOX magazine) and a pleasing magazine to read. Anyone "hooked" on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a PSM and get a subscription.

Humor, beautifiul girls, and strangeness
Maxim aims itself straight at what the straight male psyche likes: laughter, girls, and bizarre subjects (such as "How to Survive Torture", a topic in the September 2001 issue).<p>... this magazine is not just about sex and bad taste.  It celebrates male life, and it does this without apology.  Men have apologized far too much; the people who seem to think maleness needs to be "fixed" are maladjusted [people] who would never cut men any slack anyway, no matter how "sensitive" or politically correct men pretend to be, so men might as well party.  Maxim is the technical journal of this attitude!<p>Maxim and some other men's magazines (like Men's Health) have discovered a formula that works to keep men reading: To-the-point articles thoroughly interleaved with humor and banter; lots of photographs and descriptive drawings; and topics ranging from sex and seduction to war and first aid.  Lots of practical information and lots of truly excellent photos of sexy women that are not raunchy.<p>If I could only read one men's magazine, this would be it.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Is Maxim worth the time?
I honestly can't find a better magazine for men.  Maxim takes into account the third-grade like attention span of most men, and combines it with the imaturity of what seems to be an all-men publishing force. While it may seem Maxim is marketed to the single man, I've found that most girlfriends and wives enjoy this magazine as well.  The pictorials are decent enough not to embarass you on and airplane, and the articles contain enough substance to make you laugh, and intrigue you.  In reality, if your life consists of middle-management, beer, and an interest in the pursuit of meaningless information, this magazine is for you!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
From a woman's point of view...
As a female reader, I've always thoroughly enjoyed Maxim. Sure I have to get past the loads of pictures of half-nude women (although I must admit they're hard to ignore), but there's lots of funny, interesting, if not always useful and profound, content. As a guy's girl, I always get alot of laughs out of Maxim, it's sense of humor is right up my alley, and the type of humor I'll never see in a women's magazine! Not only that, knowing men like I do, it's funny to read these articles that are geared toward you guys. Take heart, losers everywhere, there's hope; there's Maxim.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
What every guy needs to know...
Always interesting, MAXIM delivers information and humor aimed squarely at the male audience. MAXIM is a hip cross between MAD Magazine (off-the-wall humor), and a censored version of Playboy (lots of bare skin, but no naughty bits showing). The results are always side-splitting, if not informative.<p>Part of the humor comes from how dumbed-down some of the information is, just to make sure men everywhere can understand what the editors are trying to say (and they flat-out tell you, &quot;Hey, we dumbed this down so you'd get the point, stupid!&quot;). Anything real in the way of education or enlightenment comes sprinkled with jokes, and photos of scantily clad beauties to ensure capturing the attention of the male reader.<p>Besides humor, articles talk about exercise, fashion, electronics, cars, and sex. <p>A men's magazine for the over-18 age group, one can expect spicy pictures, a few naughty words, and other adult-slanted humor and commentary throughout. Probably not recommended for the conservative crowd.

5 Stars for Maxim
First off I will state I'm a female.  I enjoy reading Maxim.  I don't care one way or the other for the females.  The subscription is not mine but my male partners.  I always look forward to him finishing a Maxim magazine so I can get my hands on it.<br /><br />Maxim does not conform to the same humdrum boring articles that can be found in most any magazine.  There is humor, wit, insight, and intelligence.  Granted, most of it is dumbed down a bit so that anyone of reasonable intelligence should be able to comprehend and understand.  <br /><br />I won't deny that Penthouse and Playboy have some good articles.  On occasion I can overlook the naked women to read a bit of one of those.  Quite honestly if I wanted to see T&A I'd look in a mirror.  As others have mentioned the women in this magazine may show some flesh but their "naughty bits" are usually covered.  <br /><br />I realize the "target audience" for this magazine is men.  However I think there is a lot that women can learn from this magazine as well.  Probably even many women who can appreciate Maxim magazine.  While it may not show "naughty bits" articles many times are of an adult nature.  Can't say I'd recommend letting children getting their hands on it.

You dont have to be male to enjoy this magazine
I constantly stole this from my ex, and he would get upset with me, but I couldnt help it, I thought it was great.. Very funny, a plethora of topic. Chicks. get it.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
I swear I read it for the articles.
I'm an 18 year old girl at college and my roommate bought me for Christmas a subscription to Maxim because I like it so much.  Sure, it can seem degrading, but it really is all in jest.  This magazine is full of interesting articles, funny jokes, fair and educated reviews, and useful/useless trivia.  You can easily read it from cover to cover and stay amused the entire time.  Sure, there are some scantily-clad women in it, but even as a straight female I can appreciate a beautiful woman's body.  Maxim doesn't mind mixing seriousness with fun, which is something that women's magazines have yet to discover.  People say that Cosmo is essentially the women's equivalent of Maxim, but it's humor level is nowhere near that of Maxim.  It prints funny jokes, hilarious Beat-This-Captions (my favorite feature), and isn't afraid to superimpose a beanie atop President Bush's head.  It goes where truly no magazine has before; it's fascinating.  Until another magazine can have such a fun-loving, yet level-headed perspective on the world, Maxim will definitely be my favorite.

Girls find this magazine a fun read, too
As a secondhand Maxim reader (various male coworkers and friends always have it around), I have found Maxim to be nothing short of hilarious in each and every issue.  If you want to kill a few hours and laugh a lot, this is the magazine for you.  Yes, there are scantily clad women in it, but so what?  You see the same nudity in most women's fashion magazines-especailly in the ads.  This magazine is a great gift for the men in your life.

The Jack-of-All-Trades Magazine
Popular Mechanics is a Jack-of-All-Trades Magazine.  I have been an avid reader since high school picking up every other issue or so at local newsstands.  I only recently finally got smart and picked up a subscription.  For the price you can't go wrong.  PM is filled with informative articles on everything ranging from new technology, world events, woodworking tips, car care, automotive design, and computers.  PM does not delve to deep into any particular subject, rather it gives you a broad view of all of them.  <p>In each issue your likely to find tips on how to change and fix a flat tire on your car, plans on how to build wood furniture, reviews on new cars, and reports on upcoming technology.  The articles are always interesting and provide enough information to let you do a little more digging if the subject matter sparks your interest.  Jay Leno even writes an automotive section that is always enjoyable to read.  <p>The product reviews are informative and have helped me with numerous purchases ranging from new cars, snow blowers, power tools, dirt bikes and the like.  I would recommend this magazine to anyone interested in any of the mentioned subjects but can't afford 40 different subscriptions to cover them all.

Covers all the bases
For me, this magazine has it all: technology, automotive, aviation, boats, home repair, and much more. It gives a great overview of what is happening in many industries and hobbies. I have generally read the entire issue two days after I have received it, and I don't have a lot of free time for reading.<p>One of the best aspects of this magazine is that is does not take itself too seriously. It does a great job creating articles that are informative and detailed, but leaves room for fun and offbeat topics too.<p>Last year Popular Mechanics readers got to follow a PM sponsored NASCAR car. This year they have switched to a top fuel dragster. These articles give you a good behind the sense look at what it takes to race these impressive vehicles.<p>If racing is not your style, checkout the woodworking section where a myriad of woodworking projects are presented. Don't forget their annual woodworkers special with a whole host of plans in a single issue.<p>Got a leaky water heater? Check the home repair section. Car on the fritz? Check the auto repair section. Wondering what is new in the military? Watch for the frequent special articles on the Special Forces and their hardware. This magazine has a great deal to offer!<p>For an all around look at technology and all things mechanical, you can't beat Popular Mechanics!

Chock-Full of Information
I took a chance on this magazine approximately 1yr. ago and I am not sorry I did.  It has a wealth of information covering almost anything mechanical and electrical.  The how-to section is always informative and helpful, as well as, educational.  I will continue this subscription indefinately.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Tyrone

I've been reading PM for over 55 years ... and it's still an excellent read!
When I was a little guy my bedtime reading included Winny the Pooh, The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Brave New World, and four "How-To" magazines including Popular Mechanics. Three of the magazines changed direction (and/or failed) over the years, but Popular Mechanics stayed true to its Do-It-Yourself-type readers and is still worth reading cover-to-cover.<br />No I'm not interested in selling my Popular Mechanics collection; I'm still using them.

Popular Mech. review
As a kid I loved reading this magazine,it was fascinating and wonderous to see new inventions,auto mechanics know how and possibly soon to be released new products. It fired up my imagination in studying to become a mechanical engineer. Today I love it just as I did years ago as a kid.<br />I would highly recommend it to anyone with a love of wanting to know how things work and like repairing things themselves.

Popular Mechanics - Great magazine!!!
I remember my uncle used to have these at his home in the 60s.  I thought they were great then.  The magazine has changed it's focus a bit but I LOVE IT.  Great magazine.

Popular Mechanics Mag - a winner
A monthly magazine, aimed at hobbyists and           do-it-yourselfers. Deep enough to appeal to engineers, but written well enough to be readable for others.

While many magazines today are full of gimicky tricks of the trade, PM does away with much of that. The mag is filled with great DIY and many fascinating articles.

tech background not necessary to enjoy
You don't have to have a Ph.D. in computers, math, or engineering in order to enjoy this magazine:  I don't possess such credentials, and I think Wired is outrageously good.  The appeal of Wired is information on cutting-edge technology, delivered in a highly visual, understandable, and often entertaining format.  A subtle sense of humor pervades the magazine with features such as "Return to Sender" - a contest in which Wired readers attempt to send the weirdest possible item in the mail to the magazine's San Francisco headquarters; or "Japanese Schoolgirl Watch" - which tracks the latest trendy gadgets favored by one of the world's most trend-obsessed demographic groups.  Wired endlessly scrutinizes and ponders on the intersection of technology, humans, and society in its terrific articles.  The articles are always interesting, and well-written, with topics such as artificial sight research, or the shenanigans of MIT's Blackjack Team in Las Vegas (9/02 issue); parents of extremely ill children, united via the Internet in their challenges to the medical industry (9/01); or a profile of the Ibot Transporter "inventrepreneur," Dean Kamen (9/00).  Wired is a beautifully presented, outstanding magazine.  Try one issue - you might get hooked!

Read about the future before it arrives!
I have been a consequent Wired reader since 1994. Subscribing on and off, depending on the quality of the content (the design has almost always being impeccable), I find Wired has been going through one of its best times in the course of the past year or so. Since they've always been ahead of the curve, presenting the future 'now' by means of a thoughtful combination of to-the-point introductions to a topic or piece of gear with lengthy interviews or articles dealing with the hottest topics in technology and our lives at large in the years and decades to come, it could be argued that the world -at the fast pace it is going- is providing them with an overabundance of content ideas. But as a publication, you could very well, take a very interesting topic and put together a lame writing around it, so there is great merit in what the Wired team is doing.<p>As an example, let me share the general layout of November 2003's issue:<br>-Big focus on Open Source (remember Linux and its creator, Linus Torvalds?), and how it's beginning to permeate all areas, beyond software.<br>-A feature on the latest on studies about sleep and wake-up drugs.<br>-Quite a few interesting articles on copyright infringement and what a famous media powerhouse is doing, by going in the oposite direction, becoming a P2P freedom fighter.<br>-The future of batteries and the electrical grid.<br>-Politics and how they are getting deeply affected by... blogs!<br>-The big bang... and why it never stopped.<p>And the interesting topics go on and on, written by some amazing contributors, ranging from Wired's long standing collaborators, such as Bruce Sterling, or some recently incorporated &quot;talent&quot;, such as technology columnist Dan Gillmor or Stanford Law Professor Lawrence Lessig.<p>Some of you might be wondering: what's the point in subscribing to a magazine like Wired, when I can get their content online a few weeks after the magazine is out. First of all, the subscription is SO unexpensive ($1/issue) that you shouldn't be questioning it. And second, and most important, this is a magazine (like I mentioned before) that you just don't like for its content (which is indeed available online shortly after publication), but also for its splendid layout and access to advertising for last minute products, the type that a typical Wired reader would love to learn about before they become a part of the mainstream. So get going and subscribe to Wired, so you can read about the future before it arrives!

Hands down, my favorite magazine!
I value my time, and, probably like you, get news and information from multiple sources (internet, magazines, newspapers, and TV being the principle venues).  As far as magazines go, Wired is my favorite by far; I still look forward to getting it after 5 years, and on the off chance it doesn't arrive in the mail on time, I slap around my mailbox in dissapointment.  <br /><br />It's impossible to not be intrigued by whatever cutting-edge technology they're following, the stories of the pioneers who are developing it, and the social implications of their deployment.<br /><br />But Wired is about much more than new and interesting technology, for me, it's about perspective.  Wired always takes an adventurous and unorthodox view on todays social, scientific, and political topography.  But most refreshingly, they observe the world optimistically.<br /><br />How rare is that!<br /><br />I'm abundantly aware of the misery of this planet, and in case I momentarily forget, I can cycle through any of the 10 news channels I have on TV for a stinging dose of painful reality.  Wired doesn't keep you immune to the challenges of our day, but rather than "objectively" explore them, they help me view the news through a lens of productive possibility.  <br /><br />Valuable indeed.<br /><br />In addition, every issue contains a "radar update of cool"; cool music, movies, books...cool gadgets for home and lifestyle; Wired is - aside from being my favorite magazine - also, in my humble opinion, the coolest.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br />Santa Barbara, California <br /><br /><br /><br />

Be in the Know
I'm a 30-something female who is NOT a techie geek. However, I've been a subscriber to Wired magazine for several years now, and I love it (and so does my husband)! <br /><br />Obviously, there are some articles I don't relate to at ALL (nor do I understand them). However, the majority of articles are engaging and downright fascinating. For example, the most current issue (Jul. 2007) features a cover story of Transformers (the movie). But what I DIDN'T realize (until I read this issue) is that many fans were concerned about the choice for director ("Please God, don't let Michael Bay screw this up.") because many children of the 80's (of which I am one) saw Optimus Prime as a father figure, especially for the latch key kids. <br /><br />These fans were concerned that Bay, known for his blow-em-up action flicks, would disregard the emotional component of Transformers--which is (apparently) important to many. <br /><br />Let me share a few of the stories from the current issue to show you the kind of goodies you get in each issue: <br /><br />* Sail of the Century - Venture capitalist Tom Perkins wanted a new boat, so he built the biggest, riskiest, most technologically advanced sailing machine on the planet <br /><br />* The Whole Earth, Catalogued - How Google Maps is changing the way we see the world <br /><br />* The Human Advantage - Computers are great at crunching numbers. But when it comes to tasks like translating languages or identifying beauty, the cortex still beats the CPU <br /><br />* The Trials of Hans Reiser - A brilliant but irascible coder. A missing wife. Incriminating blood. And a host of questions. How a Linux geek became a murder suspect. <br /><br />Of course, there's also must-have gears and gadget profiles as well as reviews. Rants from readers are featured, as well as thought-provoking essays. (This month's essay? Why the U.S. needs a high-speed rail system.) <br /><br />Perhaps my favorite monthly feature, though, is Artifacts from the Future. These faux "ads" from the future are clever--and slick as spit. You'd never know they were jokes at first glance! <br /><br />So if you're interested in trends involving computers, religion/spirituality, art, music, transportation, the environment, gaming, pop culture, medicine, journalism, sports, psychology and more...you'll probably enjoy Wired. The interviews are utterly intriguing (this month, Wired did a mini-interview with Nicole Lapin, one of the youngest anchors in CNN's history), and the graphics are smart and appealing. Even the ads are (usually) fresh and compelling (well, when they're not aimed at twenty-something corporate males...)!

Still a great magazine
My favorite magazine is probably still Wired magazine.<p>I have been a subscriber almost continuously from around 1994 or so.<p>Despite a history of excessive advertising and embarrassing flag waving about the glory of the internet economy Wired has consistently informed and entertained me with quality articles about the things that I enjoy:  internet, software, business, technology, politics, travel, etc.<p>It has also been a major innovator in terms of the visual style of magazines.  Their style was as new and different at its introduction as was MTV when it first appeared in the 80s.<p>The articles are largely targeted to 20 - 40 year old upper-middle-class, liberal technology industry oriented people, although I doubt there is anything in its content that conservatives or non-tech people would find offensive.<p>My issue goes straight into the toiletside magazine rack every month when it arrives.

Wired
I purchased this magazine for my son ( a 14 yr old science mind).  He loves it!  He educates me after reading each issue.  It is difficult to find magazines to enhance or go beyond classroom instruction.  When this one arrives, we do not see him for hours.  I bought Wired for him a year ago and will happily keep renewing his subscription.<br /><br />It would make a great gift. <br /><br />It is now April 13, 2008; this magazine is still going strong in our house.  I still highly recommend this magazine.<br /><br />It is now March 24, 2009; several years have passed and we still are still enjoying this magazine!

I miss wired
*Design*<br>This magazine is beautiful. I've still got their 2nd issue from way back then and their designs used to be outrageous up until completely unreadable. Fortunately Wired's current design is still (somewhat) cool, but readable. They've won all the prices: that alone is a reason to check it out.<p>*Content*<br>Wired is often wrong, very wrong even. Anybody remember &quot;push technology&quot;? (they dedicated a significant part of an issue declaring that the browser your still using was obselete), Wired Fund?. There are many examples where Wired makes *big* mistakes . However, its counter-culture meets business meets high tech stile is unmatched. A visionary that produces a new vision every month can't be right every time. That's why I am taking a subscription again. <p>Buy a newsstand issue, love it, and get a subscription too.

They really can keep it interesting
What I like about wired:  it's simple, they forget about rules and guidelines and push boundaries where they can be pushed, write stories nobody else wants to touch on, say what they want about products that others won't dare.  It's what this magazine is known for.  They keep things interesting every month and they are quite diverse that you can always find a way to spend an hour or two going through the magazine.  <p>How many other magazines out there will write a FIFTY page article about the DOJ vs Microsoft and not give a hoot about how much space that took.  <p>Or write a aritcle after article that on some pages are just nothing but text, no pictures, no cheat sheets, just text.  <p>Or that review products givng them a bad name while the advertiser is staring you in the face on the next page.  <p>They have a cult following and a very talented staff....please, check this out...it's so cheap you owe it to yourself to get a subscription!!

The best technology magazine out there
Wired magazine is probably the best US magazine that covers the latest trends in technology and the way that they impact the society. It was started in 1993 during the early days of the internet revolution, and unlike many other technology trends from the 90s it has proven to have a staying power. In terms of both the content and design it is one of the most interesting magazines out there. It regularly features reviews and comparisons of new products, and that feature alone is worth the cover price. Wired is also well known for its in-depth coverage of major new technological trends, oftentimes well before they reach the perception of the general public. It critically evaluates those trends, and it is far less susceptible to hype and grandiose overstatements than many other technological news sources. You are not very likely to find a corporate fluff-piece in Wired, and you know that its journalists are professionals with integrity. The articles that deal with the impact of technology on society are written mostly from a left-leaning perspective, but they are overall well written and argued. In fact, Wired is not beyond being a contrarian in many of its analyses, even when they challenge some of the most cherished presumptions of whatever ideology. The case I point is the issue of a few years ago where they debunked many of the environmentalists' favorite dogmas. (For instance, it is more environmentally friendly to run an AC than a heater; housing in Arizona is better for the environment than the housing in Vermont.)<br /><br />If you want to know what are the best and the coolest new technological trends, and how they may impact your life, there is probably no better magazine out there than Wired.

Wired
I have loved Wired since I first picked it up 5 years ago. It felt like, finally, someone made a magazine for ME. Technology applied to culture, trends, daily life, medicine, fashion, and much more!

AWESOME
This is an awesome read. Great topics, great writing. Wired is always a couple of months ahead of the game. Watching the topics that are covered in prime time TV, I often wonder if they take their cues, and get their inspiration from the social issues covered here.  Wired also offers great insight into technology and the businesses that surround it, profiles design trends, and occasionally covers cutting edge sports too! I loved their recent article on kite-surfing.

Coolest Magazine Ever
I do not consider myself a computer/tech geek by any stretch of the imagination - however - I am amazed at the things I've learned and are fascinated by when reading WIRED.  Can't say enough good things about the magazine that covers topics from global warming to what stuff really goes into your pet's food.  Covers video games that I can talk to my sons about and things that make me feel smart - like about the human anatomy, etc.  READ IT!

What a BLAST !!!
Okay, I've read the other reviews that call this publication shallow, lacking in depth, geared toward young teenagers, etc.  I guess if you are looking for twenty page, in-depth technical articles that delve into every minute neutron of a particular subject, then yes, this publication might not be what you're looking for.<br /><br />But, if you're a regular, average, ordinary guy like me (who would not understand those deep, brainy articles anyway) and you are looking for an entertaining, informative view onto what's new and what's cool, I think you'll be pleased.  Very pleased! <br /><br />Take, for example, a couple of recent issues (see the date of when this review was written).  Last month was focused on the future of personal aviation and the people behind the effort to make personal flight more available and affordable, and about the aircrafts they are inventing.  Fascinating!  Now, can I run out and build myself a prototype after reading the articles?  Ummm, no.  Do I know a whole lot more about an incredibly fun subject then I did before?  Yes!<br /><br />This month's issue focuses on similar theme: The future of personal space travel and the idea of a space-hotel.  When you're done reading it will you be able to build a rocket and fly to the moon?  Of course not.  But it's informative and educational to the exact level I would want it to be... just enough to make me aware, enlightened, and entertained.<br /><br />So to all the non-nerds, non-rocket scientists, and non-brainiacs who want a scientific publication by the people, for the people, I think your yearly subscription money will be well spent.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Wonderful magazine for the inquisitive mind!
I ordered this magazine for my husband, knowing it was up his alley, but had no idea I would like reading the magazine as well. I couldn't believe the latest edition with the prizes given to students/people who came up with great scientific ideas or products. Most were amazing, but a couple were eye-opening and made me think &quot;why don't we have that already??&quot; Plus this magazine had tidbits of electronics, many many ebay ads (haha, I love ebay too), and overall is quite interesting. Wonderful graphics that help you understand the scientific ideas. A great gift for an inquisitive person!!! A+++!!! Will reorder next year!

A Must For The Scientific Mind
Popular Science focuses on a broad range of scientific topics. Without being overly technical, it discusses topics from new and upcoming products to theoretical ideas: topics like new suspension systems in next years line of sport utility vehicles, to the latest intelligence networks, to NASA's latest flying machine. It is very reader friendly and will appeal to anyone intrigued by the sciences, regardless of education. It makes a great, low cost gift, or great coffee table material that will be impossible to put down. You can also subscribe directly from their web site at popsci.com.

How to get a boy to read
This is it--the surefire way to get relunctant boy readers engrossed in cool and educational reading.  My teenage son can usually find anything to do except read, but he reads this cover to cover and is always reading the highlights to me.  The perfect gift for boys who are fascinated with science, flight, or interesting stuff such as the account of a couple of chemists who use liquid nitrogen to make ice cream in 30 seconds--OK so you don't want them to try that at home, but get this mag for your young scientists.  They will love it.

Best Mag
For me this magazine is good for learning what the newest gadget out there is.  Alot of fun to see the new inventions in it.  Also there is lots to read on subjects like NASA's progress on light speed, this was a good article and very imformative.  I'd say for your money's worth this is a good magazine not just for you but for your children as well.  I've been reading Popular Science since I was in junior high.  I've also gotten ideas for projects in school and have used it for information many times.

A wonderful discovery
Popular Science entered my household during the past year via our resident seventh grader. I must admit that I had not picked up a copy of the magazine in a few decades (since I was a seventh grader?), but it has quickly become one of my favorites (no fights yet over who gets to read it first, however). I can't say enough about the magazine itself: In short, it has adapted its content to a Men's Health-influenced architechture, editorial sensibility and pace. Great writing ranging from two sentence &quot;cool gadet&quot; finds to indepth investigative journalism offer the reader plenty of pleasurable surprises in each issue.

I love it!!!
I have been getting this magazine for 2 years now and it is a lot of fun to read.  I would recomened this magazine to anyone with an interest in science, technoogy, or just likes to read about really cool stuff!!!

A Guide to non-Virtual Reality
I started reading PopSci when I was working as a full time computer consultant and tech. Byte and other industry magazines might be in the know as to the most essoteric of developments in research (expressed in jargon heavy terminology), but nothing surpassed PopSci when it came to identifying relavent scientific developments and tracking them through research, development, and eventural implimentation. From my point of view, if I wanted to know the possible computer developments two or three years down the road, I'd read Byte--if I wanted to know what was going on the market in a month or two (as well as further down the road) I read PopSci.

I'm certain that I was still in grade school when my dad subscribed to Popular Science. I remember gathering the mail and if there was a new isssue, I would go to the big green recliner and read the magazine from cover to cover without pause.

Verizon's best phone, and a worthy competitor to the iPhone
UPDATED 5/14/2010 WITH COMPARISON TO NEW HTC DROID INCREDIBLE<br /><br />If you're considering getting a Droid with Verizon, you should probably also consider the HTC Droid Incredible.  I have one now and can tell you how they compare.  (My wife's new-every-two came up and she kindly took my 6-month-old Droid off my hands so I could use her discount to get an Incredible.  Is that true love or what??)<br /><br />The first difference you notice is that the Droid has a physical slide-out keyboard while the Incredible does not.  This makes the Incredible thinner and lighter (4.6 ounces compared to the Droid's 6 ounces).  The weight difference doesn't look like much on paper, but it feels significant.  <br /><br />Other differences:  <br /><br />- The Droid's battery lasts a couple hours longer than the stock battery that comes with the Incredible.  <br /><br />- The Incredible's MP3 player has better sound quality when using good earphones or plugged into the car stereo.  The Droid's sound quality isn't bad at all, but it's not up to par with the iPhone or iPod touch.  The Incredible's sound quality is similar to iPhone / iPod touch.    <br /><br />- The Droid has 3 customizable home screens, the Incredible has 7, plus a cool way to navigate among them by seeing a thumbnail of all 7 at the same time.  (I can't imagine filling up all 7, I've only filled up 2 of the 7.)<br /><br />- Multitouch pinch and zoom is implemented better on the Incredible than on the Droid, though the new 2.1 Android software update that all Droids should have now has improved it substantially on the Droid. <br /><br />- The Droid comes with a 16gb micro SD card, the Incredible either comes with none or with a 2gb card (mine came with none, but Verizon sometimes includes one).  However, the Incredible has 8gb of internal flash memory, which is plenty to get started, and you can add a micro SD card later if you want. <br /><br />- The Droid's camera is definitely not below average, and sometimes takes really good pictures.  The Incredible's camera takes better pictures indoors and similar or slightly better pictures outdoors.  The Incredible's camera has 8 megapixels, the Droid's has only 5.  But 5 is as good or better than the vast majority of camera phones, and besides, if you set your camera at the maximum resolution, your pictures will take up more memory.  With any camera, 3 megapixels is plenty enough for most purposes, including getting sharp 4" prints if you want them.  <br /><br />- The Droid's speakerphone is a bit louder than the Incredible's.  The difference is not huge, but it's noticeable.  <br /><br />- The Droid runs the standard Android operating system, version 2.l.  The Incredible includes that plus includes HTC Sense, which adds a few nice tweaks to the basic Android software.  I don't think the difference is enough to influence most people's purchase decision.  <br /><br />- On paper, the Incredible's internal processor is faster than the Droid's.  But I do not notice any difference in performance when running the same apps on both phones side by side.  And the Droid's processor is faster than almost every other smart phone.  <br /><br />Overall, both phones are really really excellent, both are very fast, both have huge beautiful displays, and both have tons of great features.  You can't go wrong with either phone.  <br /><br />I think the choice for most people will come down to the physical keyboard vs. thinness/weight issue, and possibly the camera if you like using your phone to take a lot of pictures.  <br /><br />That's the end of my update.  Here's my original review of the Droid (sorry for the length!):<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I wanted an iPhone bad, and finally gave up waiting for it to come to Verizon.  Got a Droid and am very happy with it.  <br /><br />The screen is awesome - bigger than an iPhone's and more dense with pixels, so images are very sharp.  The colors are great, and the screen is nice and bright.  I had a Samsung Rogue for about 10 days.  Everyone raved about the Rogue's screen.  The Droid's screen blows it away.  The touch screen is accurate and responsive, and very intuitive to use.  About as good as the iPhone but much better than every other touchscreen phone I've tried and better than a few cameras with touchscreen controls.  <br /><br />The Droid's display is sharp enough and wide enough to view most web pages - including those not specifically formatted for mobile phone browsers.  Because of this screen and because of the way that the Android OS implements the browser, surfing the internet is very easy, intuitive, and pleasant.  Much less horizontal scrolling/panning.  Much better than most phones I've tried, including the Samsung Rogue and Blackberry.  The iPhone's browser is also a pleasure to use, but the Droid's screen is better at displaying full web pages.  <br /><br />Email is very well-implemented in the Droid.  I was already a Gmail and Google calendar user before getting my Droid, and the level of integration is amazing, thanks to the Google Android OS.  But any Android phone will also handle most other popular webmail, like hotmail, and also can sync with Microsoft Outlook and similar programs.  <br /><br />The Droid's call quality is good, and the speakerphone is loud and clear enough to be useful in most places.  I get slightly better reception with the Droid than with my previous Verizon phones, especially in places with poor network coverage.   <br /><br />The Droid's built-in Facebook app is good, but is not as full-featured as the iPhone's FB app, which has been around longer and had more time to be improved.  Yet, the Droid's FB app is as good as or better than FB access I've seen on most smartphones, including Blackberry and especially the new Samsung Rogue. <br /><br />One extremely cool thing is you can easily import the contact info from all your Facebook friends into the Droid's contact manager, including their profile photo, email, phone, birthday, etc.  Then, from your contact list, you can tap on any of their names and with one touch either call, email, or jump to their FB page.  This is very well-implemented and easy to use, and makes the Droid's contact manager highly useful.  <br /><br />The Droid has pretty good voice recognition.  I can tap the microphone icon in the upper right corner of the screen and say "Starbucks" and the Droid will show a list of the nearest Starbucks - and then I can pick one and either touch the phone number and Droid will call it, or I can touch the address and Droid will show its location on a map and give me driving directions.  <br /><br />Droid like all Android phones has Google maps built in, including satellite view, and Droid can give you directions (from your current location or any location) just like Google maps on a computer.  <br /><br />What's more, Droid has built-in GPS functionality and can give spoken directions, just like a Garmin GPS.  I tried it and it works pretty well.  <br /><br />Loading music and photos onto the Droid is as easy as dragging and dropping files from your computer to a thumb drive.  Droid's music player is not as refined as iPod/iPhone, but it is easy to use and works great.  If you have an iPod, you probably have lots of music tracks in AAC format.  The Droid will play them no problem, as long as they don't have DRM copy protection (and most don't nowadays).  The Droid also plays MP3 and other formats.  <br /><br />The Droid has the standard 3.5" headphone jack so you can use it with any earphones, unlike some phones that have a non-standard jack.  To judge the sound quality, I listened to the same track on the Droid and on an iPhone.  Using $100+ headphones, the sound quality was better on the iPhone, but the difference was harder to notice with cheaper earphones or through my car stereo.  Yet, the Droid's sound quality is as good or better than other music-playing wireless phones, and I've tried quite a few.   <br /><br />I have not yet loaded videos on the Droid.  But I have watched streaming video, and it is very smooth, studder-free, and looks really great, best I've ever seen on any phone, including the iPhone and iPod touch. <br /><br />The Droid comes with a 16GB microSD card.  These normally go for 40 to 50 bucks at least, so I'm really grateful that Verizon and Motorola included it with the phone.  It can hold a ton of music, video, and photos.  For comparison, the highest-capacity iPod Nano also has 16gb of storage.  <br /><br />Plus, the Droid has internal memory for apps and its own operating system, so your phone will still work in the unlikely event the SD card ever fails. (My Droid worked fine even though the Verizon store guy didn't insert the SD card correctly when he set up my phone and the phone didn't recognize it.  I reinserted it later and all was fine.) <br /><br />The Droid's interface and OS (Android) is not quite as polished as the iPhone's.  But it is still excellent, VERY easy to learn, and very easy to navigate around and use.  Like most phones, the Droid is highly customizable (ringtones, wallpapers, placement of your favorite widgets and icons on your home screens), and the Android OS makes it super easy to do so.  <br /><br />The Droid has one-touch access to the Android app market, which has 10,000 apps so far.  I've downloaded a couple dozen.  There are lots of good ones, but overall the Android app market lags the iTunes app store in selection and quality, and specific apps available for both platforms tend to be a little better on the iPhone/iPod touch than on Android. <br /><br />However, the Android app market is much younger than iTunes app store and is growing very quickly.  Until the Droid, there were only a few phones running Android.  That number will at least double over the next few months, and the number of people who use phones running Android will more than double, according to industry projections, because of the increasing quality and selection of Android phones on most major carriers.  All this will fuel even more rapid growth in the Android app market.  But even in its present state, you can find a lot of really useful and fun apps for the Droid, many of which are free.   <br /><br />The physical QWERTY keyboard is not as good as it could be.  The keys are flat with no space between them.  Still, I'm not a big texter and I find the keyboard fairly easy and pleasant to use.  I also find the 5-way rocker button on the keyboard to be very useful.  But if I were a big texter, I might not like the keyboard as much.  So, my advice is to go to your local Verizon store and try out their demo unit. <br /><br />The 5 megapixel camera has a built-in LED flash.  I have taken a couple dozen pictures inside and out, and find the photos to be acceptable, good for a camera phone, but nowhere near as good as a dedicated digital camera, and maybe slightly inferior to the iPhone's picture quality.  The flash is better than nothing, but causes the colors to be off.  I have posted 6 pictures I took with the Droid to the "customer images" area so you can see for yourself the quality of photos you get with Droid.  Once you snap a picture, you have to wait a couple seconds before Droid will let you take another; this lag is common on camera phones and cheap digital cameras, but seems slightly worse on the Droid.  <br /><br />I have not yet shot any video clips with the Droid, so can't comment on their quality. <br /><br />The Droid is 1.5 to 2 ounces heavier than most other smart phones I've used or tried.  Doesn't sound like much, but you can definitely notice it.  For me, having the bigger screen and keyboard easily justifies the weight, but for some folks, the weight could be an issue.  This is another reason why I wouldn't suggest ordering it online without first seeing it and holding it at your local retailer. <br /><br />Everyone has different tastes, but I think the Droid is not the most stylish phone.  It has kind of a masculine, industrial look to it, which I can tolerate but I'm not crazy about it.  But, it is easy to change the wallpaper, and there are a variety of cases for the Droid - more coming out every week - so you can customize the look any way you want.  <br /><br />The only other thing I'm not crazy about is no physical dedicated call button.  To use the phone, you have to press the phone icon on the home screen.  This is a very minor inconvenience, and I got over it pretty quickly.  But it'll bug some people.  <br /><br />I really like that the Droid has WiFi, and I've used it to connect to wireless networks at home, work and a Panera cafe.  It's easy and works great.   <br /><br />If you've taken the time to read all this, then you're probably interested enough to justify a trip to your local Verizon store or Best Buy and play with their demo unit.  Try the keyboard, try the browser, play around with the pre-installed apps or maps.  Take a picture or video clip.  See how the weight feels in your hand.  I think you'll really like the Droid, especially if you'd been wanting an iPhone but didn't want to leave Verizon to get one.

Best Verizon Smart Phone Ever!
I've own many of the Verizon smart phones including the Treo, Moto Q, XV6700, Sage, Omnia, Touch Pro, Blackberry Curve, Storm1, etc.  The Droid is the best VZW smart phone I've ever used.<br /><br />LIKES<br /><br />- Nice, big screen.  The touch interface is will done.<br />- Full exchange email support including calendar, contact sync, and email folders.  Separate corporate calendar is cool too.<br />- Voice search is the bomb. I searched "McDonalds", "home depot", and "gas station" and found the closest ones to my location.  I searched on "Phone John Smith Mobile" and droid made the phone call.  I even searched "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and got the wiki page. lol<br />-  The free GPS is excellent.  The satellite layer is awesome.  I was going to buy a GPS so the Droid saved me a couple bucks.<br />- Facebook contact integration is nice.<br />- Tethering is available via the PDANet app.<br />- Battery life is surprisingly decent.  I returned many good windows mobile phones simply because of the lack luster battery life.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br /><br />- No Send or End Buttons.  I'd much prefer initiating and terminating a call with dedicated buttons<br />- Flat keyboard causes some typos. The top row of keys are too close to the bottom of the screen.<br />- I don't like the window shade motion for notifications.  I'd prefer a simple button press.<br />- When viewing emails in landscape mode, the on-screen Delete button is right next to the back button.  I deleted 2 emails already. :-P<br />- I've observed some button press glitches when switching between landscape and portrait mode.<br />- No pitch and zoom in the browser.  Browser seems a bit slower than with the iPhone and the Palm Pre.<br />- Many operations require a couple extra button presses compared to my old Blackberry.<br />- Right now, I'd only recommend the Droid to people with a bit of geek in them.<br /><br />VS IPHONE<br /><br />The Droid is a worthy alternative but it doesn't sniff the iPhone's total user experience.  Syncing media with your iPhone is much easier.  The iPhones web browser is still the best on any phone.  The Droid's customization capability, voice search, awesome free gps, and comparable development platform does put it on the same playing field with the iphone.  The Droid however still has to make the UI a little more polished and take steps to make syncing with your computer more seamless.  Right now, I'd only recommend the Droid for people that have a slightly higher geek meter.<br /><br />VS BLACKBERRY<br /><br />Cha... I never asked my Blackberry to do much more than send messages and make calls.  And to date, it still does it better than any other device I have ever used.  The sleep case, keyboard, trackball, and typing short cuts makes the BB the most efficient device you will use for messaging.  The Droid (and the iPhone) will require extra button presses to complete the same tasks.  Heck, the sleep case alone allows you to check a message without pressing a button. ;-)<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />This is a great Verizon smart phone, possibly the best.  The voice search works brilliantly.  It's unbelievably good.  The GPS is great.  The Droid development platform seems decent.  I especially like the Droid's full exchange support.  The Droid's battery seems decent but I'll find out for sure after a couple weeks at work.  It's certainly not as bad as the launch Palm Pre-  the Pre's battery life would count down in front of your eyes. :-P <br /><br />One major gripe I have with the device is the lack of Send and End buttons.  I would never ship a phone that doesn't have Send and End buttons.  I prefer to locate these buttons by feel rather than locating them on the touch screen.<br /><br />Another gripe is that many functions on the Droid requires several extra button presses to accomplish the same task versus my old BlackBerry.  I just have to wonder if phone manufacturers ever have business people test their phone. (I'm available, Motorola! ;-)<br /><br />Should you try the Droid? Absolutely!  BlackBerry users should hang on to their receipts however.  You will give up some efficiencies in exchange for the Droid's advanced features.

An ambivalent new Droid owner...
I was so excited about this phone I bought it the first day it came out, even though I have 7 months left on my TMo BlackBerry 8900. It was everyting I've ever wanted in a smartphone, at least in theory. So, why do I say "ambivalent" in a 5 star review? Well, the only time I feel conflicted about it is when I am reading about it, or thinking about it. But when I have it in my hands, all that melts away. <br /><br />THE AWESOME:<br />* The screen, the screen, the screen. Everyone raves about it for good reason. It's just gorgeous. <br />* No need to jailbreak if all you want to do is run non-Android Marketplace apps. There's a switch for that, it's under settings / applications. It's the top option on that menu: "Allow install of non-market applications". That's it, just check a box.  <br />* The GPS - wow. Really glad I didn't invest in a "real" GPS, which I'd been intending to do. The Droid's voice navigation is everything you could ask for, without having to ever buy map updates. Ooh - and get the Google Sky app (it's free) - awesomeness in stargazing. <br />* Google! This, to me, is the biggest advantage -- the power of Google's development. This is the first few days with a major upgrade of an OS, so, everything that is "not quite there" yet about it will improve. People say it's not as polished as the iPhone, but with an open development platform on Android as opposed to Apple's walled-garden approach, it's only a matter of time. This is the first Android-based phone that Google's devs were closely involved in every step, and it's a good partnership.<br />* The network - again, wow. coming from TMo, where my area didn't get 3G until a few months ago, and with dead zones galore, this is just such a relief. <br />* Call quality - again, wow. I have never, ever experienced this sort of clarity, I was at a point where I liked smartphones mostly because I hated trying to hear & be heard on them, so it was easier to communicate via text, email, etc. Also, a very impressive speaker.<br />* Tight integration with several of Google's services, with more to come -- how nice to set up my gmail ID, go to YouTube on the phone, and just be logged in. Expect good things with Google Docs and even Wave in the future. <br /><br />THE NOT-QUITE-THERE-YET<br />* The camera takes awesome pictures in full daylight, but struggles with focus. Good news is, developers are aware of this, and a leaked memo indicates there will be an over-the-air update on or around 12/11 which will address the focus issues.<br />* The apps -- the reason there are not as many huge, shiny apps like some of the more elaborate iPhone games is that app executables can't be stored on the memory card, just in the phone's memory, so this severely limits the amount of space for larger, more elaborate apps[correction]. The good news this is also fixable by software, and you know Google will work towards this in order to compete. However there are still plenty of awesome apps, and considering how Apple tends to reject and censor apps while Google welcomes them, there will eventually be a much broader selection. (update: Facebook's iPhone app developer just quit the project because he couldn't deal with Apple's controlling tendencies.)<br /><br />THE MEH<br />* Well, the physical keyboard isn't the greatest. A bit flat, not enough key travel. However it was so easy to get good at the onscreen keyboard that this doesn't matter too much, and the real keyboard IS better (and quite adequate) for times you need to do more than a little typing. <br />* It's heavy! The night I got it, I played with it for like, 8 hours straight, and my hands were *sore*. Um, well, maybe just don't play with a phone for 8 hours straight, your hands should be fine?  <br />* Battery life, what can you expect? A device of this magnitude needs power. I carry a charger & have a power inverter in my car, and I like powerful devices so I don't mind, really. <br /><br />The other reviewers here have done a great job of going into deep detail on all the various features, these were just a couple things I wanted to point out, most especially, that almost everything brought up as a flaw is actually just an area in which Google's Android shows much potential. <br /><br />I'll be getting that media dock too, that seems like a wonderful addition. Also, I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDTXDA">Motorola S805 Bluetooth 2.0 (DJ Style) Stereo Headphones</a> and they get along with the Droid very well. It's really, really helpful to have bluetooth controls when listening to music, because it's a pain in the rear when the screen goes to sleep and all you wanted to do was skip songs or pause. <br /><br />All in all, I'm thrilled with the Droid, not just for what it is, but for what it will be - I have gone through *so* many phones in the past few years, finagling upgrades approx. every 9 months, but I believe this one will last me until I qualify for "new every 2" with Verizon - and by then, they'll have 4G. 4G!

Road Warrior's Dream
The very best cell phone for use on the road that I have ever used. And I have used a lot of them. <br />Why?<br />  1. Great telephone sound -- hugely important when you make calls all day and night.<br />  2. Great email management -- integration with both gmail and Microsoft Outlook really works and keeps it all coming.<br />  3. Great Verizon network -- puts ATT/iPhone to shame; and even better than my prior Verizon Palm in difficult locations.<br />  4. Great music system -- I put in really nice headphones because it's 3.5 mm and my good cans go in easily. And provide great sound.<br />  5. Great maps -- in each town, it tells me where I am, and navigates me to where I'm going...no bumps in the road so far.<br />  6. Great keyboards -- the on screen keyboard is actually easier and less error prone than iPhone, and the flat slide-out keyboard backlighting actually helps in dark areas, and I find it as easy to use as the Blackberry and Palm 'bump' keyboards<br />  7. Great bright screen for youtube movies when I'm bored and need a break.<br />What I'm saying is that it may be a geek's delight because it will do so much, and it may be incredibly versatile for people who want to play with app after app after app, but what I like is that it is so totally practical, so totally useful, so right for just taking care of business.<br />  8 Great extra batteries --- lasts most of the day, lot of juice in its battery, but best of all, can change batteries. Worst thing about iPhone is when it's dead, you're dead. Not so with this one.<br />THIS PHONE TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS.

Will the Google Phone replace this?
That was the question for me - should I just wait for Google's phone? I mean, it has nearly twice the processing power (1GHz, vs. 556 MHz). I'll explain below why I went ahead and picked up the Droid. (Likes/Dislikes/Contrast with what others have said/Etc). (Btw, sorry for the long review, but I do think you'll find the information helpful. :) )<br /><br />LIKES:<br /><br />- I LOVE the screen. It's mentioned in the description of the product that it can take DVD quality video - it also displays that video on an incredibly glossy and surprisingly large screen. I don't want to sound melodramatic, but it even feels amazing to the touch. Also, contrasting with my recent HTC Touch, when you make a call, and bring the phone to your cheek, it blanks the screen. That's fantastic because... well, it saves power, which is nice, but more importantly, you don't start making random phone commands because your face is touching the screen! ARGH that used to drive me crazy on the HTC. Not sure if the Eris does this or not, but it was enough to keep me from ever looking at an HTC again. <br /><br />Additionally, when you bring the phone away from your face, the screen on the Droid turns on again, so that you can hang up the phone. Very intuitive, and such a relief! I used to have to manually turn the HTC back on again (it would blank after 60 seconds) and by then, I could never tell if I was hanging up, or what. <br /><br />- Intuitive interface. Without using a manual (and I'm a huge manual reader!) I was able to navigate, check my email, make phone calls, open up the GPS, all within about the first three minutes of having the phone in my possession. The GPS is gorgeous, btw.  I'm still learning things about the phone, as I've only had it for two days. I'll be updating this review at a later date.<br /><br />- Apps. No, it doesn't have 140k apps and 3 billion downloads like the Iphone. But, as mentioned by others, it's not locked down like other Verizon phones. I've worked for a government agency that has been struggling with Verizon for YEARS to get a GPS on their BlackBerries. And now, voila, here it is. I imagine it would take someone with the leverage of Google to insist with Verizon to allow this type of functionality. Also, the Marketplace (where you find apps for the Android OS) is easy to find, navigate and purchase from, if you desire any non-free applications. It's right on your home page, and you'll be downloading and installing apps within seconds.<br /><br />Recommended Apps. There is one called KeyRing, which is free, (with a link to a Youtube video with surprisingly succinct instructions on that beautiful screen!) that holds all those plastic UPC things that various stores want you to carry around with your car keys. The camera takes the picture, identifies the UPC code and gives you the choice of over 650 retailers to choose who the UPC code works with. Very neat!<br /><br />There are also apps to lock down files (I am using one called Hide and Seek). If you want to show off your Droid, you may not want to let kids/friends/family see every last thing on your phone. An app allows you to expand your desktop from three screens to nine. (That's a big desktop! And extremely easy to navigate.)<br /><br />- Keyboard. Okay, I know it's flat, it's small, and may take some getting used to, but it's a friggin keyboard! The new Google phone doesn't have one, neither does the Iphone. I guess I'm just one of those people who have to have the tactile keyboard to type efficiently. The keys (as well as other buttons) are a rather classy looking gold color. The keyboard itself has a very easy to read and intutive layout. I do have to admit that I couldn't find the "?" key for a while. ;) On this keyboard, you don't need a shift or the alt/function button to find it. The /, ?, @ are all standard buttons, requiring no shift or additional keypress. <br /><br />The mouse thingy (for lack of a better term) looks like a fingerprint authentication device on the side of the keyboard. (If you're looking at pictures of the Droid, it's that gold square on the right side of the keyboard.) Also, very easy to use, very handy to have there (beats the heck out of arrow keys on so many other keyboards) and you can press the gold center to select items.<br /><br />- Durability. Also, something I haven't seen mentioned, and perhaps I'm more sensitive to the fact since my last phone was the recently reduced in price HTC Touch Diamond (or Pro). For whatever reason, the last two HTC phones I had (I tried the Ozone for several days as well) both seemed SO FLIMSY. The back (very cheap feeling) covers on the phones would just fly right off. When I'd slide the top on the HTC up to start typing on the keyboard, it was just so slippery. And while I'm on the HTC - that was the first phone I ever had that I would make multiple accidental calls per day. Drove me crazy! More a function of the screen, but still.<br /><br />Well, the Droid just feels tough. I mean, when you slide the top up to reveal the keyboard, it feels like you'd have to really struggle to break it and it snaps in place with an encouraging click. People have commented on the weight, but like others, I feel like I'm carrying around a computer in the palm of my hand; I can handle the extra ounce or two. I even use a belt clip (body glove case) and it works great. Very well balanced on my hip; hasn't fallen off yet.<br /><br />- Sound quality. Fantastic. I had an ENV2 from Verizon in the past, and it actually had stereo speakers which gave great sound. Well, this (over?) two inch bar on the back of the phone delivers surprisingly loud sound. I'm glad for that, since (sorry HTC!) but the HTC Touch Pro - you could barely hear someone on speaker phone. We all know how important that can be while driving without a headset. Also, the 3.5MM jack is convenient.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br /><br />There are few, since I gave it five stars.<br /><br />- Manual. There isn't one enclosed! It's a good thing it's easy to get going on this phone, as that would have been enough to make me bring it back. I've yet to actually need one, but I'm sure there is a lot of functionality on this phone that I'm still missing. <br /><br />- Phone button. I too wish there had been a hard-wired phone button. Not a big deal, as it's easy to navigate to, and if the phone's ringing, it's right there, but still.<br /><br />- Customizable buttons. There aren't any, that I've found. Externally, you have volume, camera, on/off, home, search, back, and menu. On a BlackBerry, there are several buttons you can define for yourself, which is very handy on a PDA. Allows you to pull up email, your desktop, or whatever you like with one external press of a button. I miss that. Having said that, this isn't a BlackBerry. ;)<br /><br />- No Itunes. Yet. Someone's working on an app already, though. Based on Steve Jobs' recent Google rant, I doubt Apple will make the app, despite it making business sense.<br /><br />- Picture Gallery. Not thrilled with it. There's an app that will hide the folders for you, but as it stands, it's not particularly intuitive on how they organize it as shipped.<br /><br />Contrast with what some others have said:<br /><br />- I mentioned the keyboard. I actually am ecstatic that it has one! Could be better, but sheesh! You should see the size of this thing. It's actually a surprisingly slim phone for what it offers. Frankly, I find the phone to be quite elegant.<br /><br />- The Camera. I like it. 5MP? Yowza. Very easy to use, and faster (though not stand-alone-camera-like) than any other phone I've used. <br /><br />- Google vs. Apple. I haven't read all 100 reviews, but I haven't heard the companies themselves brought up yet. Fact is, Google has a tradition (if you call a ten-something year old company as having traditions) of giving things away for free. Apple does not. I think it's important to note that Apple put the same OS on their new tablet - which gives them a bottleneck for charging for every little bit of content on their device. Essentially, it's a computer set up to be a closed-end device. Google's "marketplace" is almost a misnomer, since so many apps are available for free. As much as Google may be the next "Big Brother" - so far, they give most of their stuff away.<br /><br />- Google vs. Microsoft. One of my beefs with the HTC I just ditched was that it used Windows Mobile 6.1. I thought after seeing my wife's Omnia that I'd love it. BOY was I wrong. It crashed all the time, was slow as mollasses and was the case-book example of being a lot harder to use than other competing OSs, just like Microsoft has been since the days of DOS vs. the Macintosh. (Sorry to geek out, but have been a Microsoft user since 1991ish.)<br /><br />I've already added more applications in two days with the Android OS than I did with 6 months on Windows Mobile. Oh, and I've already updated the Android OS. You can't even go from Windows Mobile 6.1 to 6.5 w/out changing phones. OUCH.<br /><br />ETC:<br /><br />Love how much memory is shipped with this thing. 16GB? WOW.<br /><br />Video looks awesome. Can't wait to try streaming music with Pandora. (Yep, there's an app for that. And programming DirecTV? Yep, there's an app for that too. With apologies to IPhone. ;) )<br /><br />Hey, it's Verizon's network, which is just plain awesome. <br /><br />The Iphone isn't due out on Verizon until Summer, from what I understand, and who knows when Verizon will get Google's phone. <br /><br />I love Gmail and I love the integration (which is to be expected) between Android and Google's apps (like Google Docs, etc). Gmail looks plain awesome on this phone.<br /><br />Long story short: If you were looking for an Iphone with a keyboard, this will do the trick. If you want a great phone that runs the Android OS, this is what you want.<br /><br />To answer the question I posed in the title: No, I don't think it will. Here's why: Motorola has been making phones for a long, long time. I believe Motorola's expertise in the field and their consciousness of features, durability, battery life, touch screen technology, WiFi and all the rest - will simply outshine Google, at least in their first rendition. Keep in mind, even when Apple first put out the Iphone, it was hardly ideal. The 4GB IPhone was discontinued after less than 3 months.<br /><br />Plus, the Google Phone doesn't ship with a QWERTY keyboard. ;)<br /><br />2/9/10 Update:<br /><br />Okay, a few things I've learned. One, the location of the manual. :) Thanks to a commenter, not sure if links are allowed, but look to the first comment reply to this post to find it.<br /><br />Second - the screen that I love so much - well, I went looking for a protector. I'm a big suspicious of them, since I know you lose some sensitivity and have to press harder on a screen to get your phone to do what you want. Well, in Amazon's review section of one of the pricer screen protectors, several commenters mention you don't need one. I tend to agree. It looks better, feels better, and most importantly, do a google search on "Gorilla Glass" and do a Youtube search on "Droid Scratch", etc. There's a video that shows a guy using a key on his screen and it doesn't scratch. This is the same material they use to protect helicopter blades! It's amazing. This phone doesn't cease to amaze me.<br /><br />Third - I discovered voice search! Oh, this is neat. Without "learning" my voice, there's a mic next to the omnipresent Google search bar. So, I pressed the mic button, spoke "Olive Garden" into the phone and voila, it listed Olive Garden and about the 4th link down even had the one that was closest to my location! How amazing is that?! Okay, geeking out a bit, but it was very cool. Also, you can just touch the phone number that's listed right there in the Google search listing. Say goodbye to paying 411 information fees! Nice.<br /><br />Fourth - A couple of neat tricks:<br />--you press and hold an icon to move it around or toss it off your screen again. <br />--You can easily add applications to the keypad and you access them by simultaneously pressing Search and the letter. Several default options are search+B brings up your browser and search+C brings up your contacts.<br />--Pressing and holding your Home button brings up your six most recently used Apps.<br /><br />Fifth - Look out for the new Android 2.1 coming out this week! Will come back with some details. The upgrades so far have been completely painless. Basically just accept the download and it downloads and installs in the background. I believe it requires a reboot.<br /><br />Six - A couple of must-have apps:<br />--dockrunnner - is essentially the app that you use that is the same as having the doc station. Turns your Droid into an extremely serviceable alarm clock. :) With the weather!, and you have a button for turning your gallery into one of those stationary electronic picture frames (like I bought for my wife that cost me 100 bucks, though, admittedly it was about twice the size, but still...) - oh, one word of warning, some people, when they use this app can't "turn it off" and the screen "stays in landscape mode" - it's actually easy to turn off. Hold the home button down to bring up the list of six apps, and then press and hold the dockrunner button to turn it off.<br /><br />--Screen Mode - oh man, I like this app. Essentially, it puts a 3 button bar on your desktop. One for keeping the desktop on all the time without blanking to save energy. Very useful when you have your wife emailing you a shopping list before a snow storm and you need to walk through CVS without having to try to keep the screen on :) Another button makes it so that it sleeps normally, but it removes the annoying unlock button. You can also use the camera button to wake the phone back up. And finally, the last button  that makes it so that when the phone sleeps, it behaves normally (back to the unlock button being there). <br /><br />Seven - found a really, REALLY good community site out there. Again, don't know Amazon's policy on links, but heck, there's even a Verizon support rep who posts there (and that thread has 150 pages of posts since November?!). Just do a Google search on "droid forum". Extremely helpful for help, apps, tips, etc. <br /><br />Can you tell I love this phone? :P<br /><br />March 02, 2010 Update -<br /><br />Still loving the phone! Also, referring to the screen protector, etc. above - still no protector, still no scratches. It's not like I throw the phone around or anything, but I DO use a belt clip (still hasn't jumped off my hip with the Body Glove protector) and the phone still looks like it's brand new.<br /><br />A note on battery life. One thing I've done this go round that I've never done with any other phone, is I religiously let the battery die all the way down to nothing. If I'm down to 10% or less (there's an App for that! called appropriately enough "Battery Indicator" - just do a search on the marketplace for it - it's free) - I turn on my screen and let it completely discharge and then start charging again.<br /><br />This is completely anecdotal, but I'd swear that the battery actually lasts longer each time I do that. In the manual, it says to do that "a few times" if you find your battery life getting shorter - but I now go 3-5 days without a charge, despite heavy data usage. If there's one piece of advice I'd give any phone user, it's try to let your phone discharge completely for every charge to get the most out of your battery.<br /><br />Also, I've learned a lot more about Google's phone. It has had a TON of issues, starting with Google's support. Get this - it was initially only via email! No phone support whatsoever, and T-Mobile wasn't supporting the phone either. It also had a number of issues, apparently. Also, Google had initially been charging some ginormous fees if you wanted to return the phone. The FCC even did an inquiry about it - it was a whopping $350 dollars initially. This was in addition to T-Mobile's $200 early cancellation fee! Google has since dropped the price of their equipment return fee to $150 (free if within the first 14 days), but still. From articles I've read, it definitely impacted sales. It also gave me no small measure of re-assurance that I went with the right choice.

No more iPhone envy...
Ever since getting the iPod Touch, I've had an extreme case of iPhone envy; the Touch's intuitive interface, sleek design, and overall pleasant experience made me wish I could use it on the go, and not be tied down to Wi-Fi networks. As a happy Verizon customer, however, I was not going to switch providers just to get a new phone (although the thought crossed my mind more than once!). After a long wait, I finally got my hands on an iPhone competitor, the Motorola Droid. While it might not be the "iPhone Killer" that people have claimed it to be, it's a great phone in its own right.<br /><br />CALL QUALITY<br />For some reason, I get fewer service bars/seemingly weaker reception compared to my LG Dare. In the same spot, holding both phones, I get 5 bars on my Dare (which I've since given ), while I only get 2 bars on my Droid. Weird, but fortunately I haven't actually noticed any decline in call quality or reliability; it's been superb!<br /><br />SPEAKER<br />Loud, and good quality! This is important, because whether you're listening for driving directions using the built-in GPS, streaming music through Pandora, or talking, the speaker is very loud and clear.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE<br />Decent. Yes, the battery can run out quickly, but that's just because you'll find yourself using the phone so much! Some of the biggest battery drainers I've noticed have been screen brightness, GPS, and streaming radio. These problems can be resolved by turning down screen brightness (even at its lowest setting, still bright and crisp), turning off the GPS when it's not in use (through the Power Control widget), and not relying exclusively on streaming radio for music (with the included 16GB card you can store plenty!)<br /><br />DISPLAY<br />Gorgeous, crisp, and very bright display that makes other phones pale in comparison. I love it, and highly recommend those considering this phone to take a look at one in their local Verizon store. Even at its darkest setting, its very good. The high-resolution display also allows for text to appear much more detailed and crisp, a plus for those with glasses.<br /><br />CAMERA<br />The Droid packs a 5 Megapixel camera, as well as video-recording at roughly DVD-quality. The camera is a bit slow to auto-focus, but pictures come out fine. Not great, but decent for a cell phone, especially at night using the flash. While its still pictures don't come out great, the Droid's videos come out really well. The audio recorded on videos is also really good.<br /><br />LOOK AND FEEL<br />The phone isn't light, but it also isn't as heavy as I feared based on initial reviews. The only criticism is that there are no dedicated call/end buttons...instead, you have to rely on the phone application, which means you can't feel around for the call/end buttons, say you get a phone call in the middle of the night. Still, that's just a minor gripe. The phone feels sturdy, not cheap, and is pretty slim considering it packs a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard.<br /><br />KEYBOARD<br />One of the major selling points of this phone was that it has a physical keyboard. The keyboard isn't perfect - keys are shallow, too close to one another, and there isn't a dedicated row for numbers. Also, the top row of keys is inconveniently located too high to the top of the phone. Still, despite these shortcomings, I would not use this phone without the physical keyboard. After a year with the touchscreen-only LG Dare, I still had difficulty with typing, and even after 2 years with an iPod Touch - which has a much better touchscreen keyboard than the Dare - I have difficulty with typing on that, as well. While the touchscreen keyboard on the Droid is very good, I still make many fewer mistakes with the physical keyboard than with the touchscreen one. While I'd say this is largely a matter of personal preference, I'd like to emphasize that the physical keyboard isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers online made it out to be.<br /><br />Android Market<br />As it stands now, the Android Market has over 10,000 apps, while the Apple App store has over 100,000. As a result, some reviewers have said - wrongly, I believe - that the Droid is somehow more limited. One should remember that while the iPhone/Touch had a headstart in developing its application market, many new developers have flocked to Android as more phones have come to market. There already is a strong selection of apps, and this will only grow over time.<br /><br />SHORTCOMINGS<br />The two major shortcomings of this phone - especially when compared to the iPhone - are that:<br />1. Not as intuitive as the iPhone. I think this phone is great for many users, but others might find it to be a little complicated. This phone is very capable, but sometimes to find things you have to dig around a bit more than might be convenient (I don't mind this too much).<br />2. No widespread and easily available alternative to iTunes. I use DoubleTwist, but without a doubt iTunes is a much easier way to transfer media to the phone than dragging and dropping or using iTunes alternatives, for most people at least. While I don't buy MP3s online, others have also pointed to the iTunes store offering much more selection than Amazon's MP3 store.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Who should get this phone? If this is your first smartphone, you might find things to be a little difficult at first, but well worth the patience. While this phone isn't for everybody, if you are already on/hope to switch to Verizon, this is without a doubt one of the strongest offerings. I don't know if I would necessarily dump my iPhone if I were an AT&T Customer, but I think that this phone will be a very useful tool for many people who have considered an iPhone but wanted a physical keyboard, more customizability, or more Google integration. While there are a few shortcomings in design and media integration, I can now say I've found the cure to my iPhone envy!<br /><br /><br />**UPDATE 2.22.10** <br />I wanted to say that while I'm still very happy with my Droid, one problem has arisen. For some reason, text messages I compose are not always going through...after minutes of trying, the phone simply notifies me saying that the text message was not sent. I have no clue why this is happening, but must say it is a bit frustrating. Fortunately, it doesn't happen too often, but it has happened enough to notice. This has happened to text messages I've sent to people on different carriers, so I'm assuming the problem is from my end on not the recipients'. Either way, a small price to pay for an otherwise amazing phone.

Hooray
This phone is pretty great. I've been waiting for a decent smartphone to hit Verizon, and here we go.<br /><br />THINGS YOU WILL LIKE<br /><br />The screen is brilliant, and the touch interface is responsive. I expected to want the multitouch (which is disabled in the US on this device) but it's unnecessary here. You can still use it on apps, and on the browser you're not going to need it (you can tap to zoom, but unless you have trouble reading screens, you'll rarely need to zoom in. The resolution is very good, the text is crisp even in the smallest occurrences).<br /><br />Lots of apps. I'm sure the quality and variety have yet to threaten the iPhone's, but I'm impressed with what's available, and for free. <br /><br />Google maps is great. Last night on the walk home from a bar I called up a map of the area, located a pizza shop, hit the dial button on the map, and placed an order I could pick up. I've tested navigation once and it worked flawlessly. Quicker than my girlfriend's two year-old Garmin.<br /><br />Keyboard is okay. I prefer not to use it, and it's thin enough that you don't even notice it's there unless you want to pull it out. (A friend had a different slider that was fat as a cheeseburger, but here the device is very nearly as slim as the Razr.)<br /><br />THINGS YOU WILL DISLIKE<br /><br />Takes a while to charge (1-2 hours). Battery life is good, if you can come home to your charger every night. (I get 20-36 hours depending on usage.)<br /><br />No dedicated phone buttons. It's nice being able to back out of the call screen entirely if you want to look at a map or something, but if you want to hang up you still have to bring back the phone screen, touch the button to return to the call, and then hang up.<br /><br />Overall this phone is great. I figured anything I got on Verizon would be a sort of good-enough-for-now alternative to the iPhone, but this device does everything I want and I wouldn't trade it.

Best overall Phone with the largest Wireless Network.
This phone is amazing. I've been waiting for Verizon to come up with a phone that can match up to the all mighty I-phone from AT&T or Black Berry Storm 2 and did Motorola fulfill those wishes. I never like the service I received from AT&T so I didn't want to go back to them nor was I very impressed with the first Storm. Several of my friends owned the I-phone and I always loved playing with their phones as it was a easy to use and just so many options you could do with it vs. my old LG Voyager. So when my 2 year contract ended with my old LG phone I began to research what phone was out. I was amazed on the reviews and features the Droid had so I decided to head down to my local Best Buy to have a look for my self. I wasn't too impressed with the phone as BB had only a dummy phone so I couldn't turn on the phone but I decided to purchase the phone anyways with my company rep and received the phone the following day. I wasn't happy when my rep told me about the $30 data plan charge but it's worth the $ for unlimited web and email features and with my 20% corp discount it wont impact too much. When I first turned on the phone I was amazed on how the picture quality was far better over the I-phone and much superior over the Storm 2, I love how the red eye introduces the start up menu (nice job Motorola). <br /><br />Web browsing is super fast and picture quality is amazing; <br />Plenty of apps not as many as the I-phone but a decent amount and growing; <br />The phone is very responsive and fast similar to the I-phone; <br />Plenty of customization to ones personal preference an advantage over the I-phone as it is very limited to what customization you can perform to its layout; <br />All my emails easily accessible from my personal Yahoo, G mail account to my GroupWise account; <br />Music player is decent but can't compare to the I-phone; <br />Free navigation feature that really works like a Garmin with Google maps; <br />Phone service on the Verizon networks out performs AT&T, no drop calls or static with Verizon vs AT&T.  <br /><br />If I had to choose a phone today I would totally get the Motorola Droid again over the I-phone or Black Berry and I'm very satisfied with my purchase and recommend this phone to anyone who is thinking about getting a I-phone who does not want AT&T service or a Black Berry Storm who is not to crazy about the issues they had with the Storm 1. <br /><br />Web Browsing 5 out 5<br />App Store 4 out 5<br />Processor/Response time 5 out 5<br />Customization 5 out 5<br />E-mail 5 out 5<br />Music player 4 out 5<br />Navigation 5 out 5<br />Phone Service 5 out 5<br />Overall score 4.75<br />

iPhone better watch out. Droid is here!
It seems inevitable to review the phone without comparing this unit to iPhone. First off I want to say that I am not iPhone owner but my family owns them so I get to play with device a lot. So here we go.<br /><br />Look/Design/Appearance:<br />I like iPhone more with its round corner and friendlier look, it's also lighter. Droid looks industrial but a bit outdated and bulky, although the dimension is about the same considering Droid has physical keyboard.<br />The Winner - iPhone<br /><br />Display:<br />Droid's screen is simply amazing due to much better resolution. Lets just say that I am okay with no pinch-zooming feature (on iPhone) as the detail is already fine as it is, worst case I only need to zoom in once. Text and graphic is much clearer.<br />The Winner - Droid<br /><br />Keyboard:<br />Virtual + physical keyboard = win for me. Yes, the directional pad looks goofy but is still useful when typing. The keyboard itself is not as bad as some people claim to be once you get used to it. In fact I have no problem at all. Each key is not completely flat so you can feel the difference.<br />The Winner - Droid<br /><br />User Interface:<br />iPhone is easier to learn how to use. It is simple yet effective. There is no dedicated call button on Droid which I prefer. However, I do like notification system on Droid more with a slide-out drawer that you can pull out instead of in-your-face notification. <br />The Winner - iPhone by a little<br /><br />Navigation (GPS):<br />Droid seems to have more dedicated GPS with turn-by-turn direction and voice recognition (Google Maps duh). iPhone has Apps with turn-by-turn direction but you have to pay for it while this feature comes with Droid.<br />The Winner - Droid<br /><br />Processor:<br />Video and graphics look better and faster on Droid due to its dedicated graphics processor. iPhones clock rate is higher but does not matter as it lacks a dedicated graphics processor.<br />The Winner - Droid<br /><br />Browser:<br />iPhone is faster for page loads and web browsing. On both phones, you don't have to wait for full page to load before navigating. Multitouch is a neat feature for zooming on iPhone. For Droid, you have double tap zooming or button for zooming in and out.<br />The Winner - iPhone<br /><br />Customization<br />Droid is more open-source and allows more flexibility. Customization on the iPhone is almost nonexistant with only wallpaper and ringtone change. <br />The Winner - Droid<br /><br />Apps:<br />Apple carries much more apps than Google (100,000 vs 10,000). However, quantity does not always equal quality, majority of applications are plain crap or junk. Both do have great applications however. The strength of the Android market to me is its openness. In the end, iPhone has a tremendous lead in term of apps with the product being out for quite some time. <br />The Winner - iPhone<br /><br />Camera<br />Droid's auto focusing sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. The user interface is more messy on Droid and there is a lag between shot. After taking pictures for comparison, they are both average.<br />The Winner - iPhone<br /><br />Storage/Memory:<br />Droid comes with 16GB removable and expandable SD card while 3GS has either a fixed 16GB or 32GB. However, Droid can only store 256MB of apps as it runs through internal memory instead of SD. Then again, I am not much into gaming on the phone.<br />The Winner - Tie<br /><br />Mutitasking:<br />Droid easily win as iPhone can only multitask within Apple apps unless you jailbreak the iPhone. However, this may lead to other problems (virus, warranty etc). Not to mention that Apple is actively trying (and failing) to subvert jailbreaking attempts.<br />The Winner - Droid<br /><br />Mobile Standard:<br />CDMA cannot support phone calls + internet browsing at the same time unless there is Wi-Fi connection. GSM networks also dominate the world market.<br />The Winner - AT&T and thus iPhone.<br /><br />Call quality<br />This is a bit subjective as it depends on where you live. One service may get you better coverage than the other. For me I live and travel frequently in Northeast (Washington DC, NYC, Boston, Philly) and Verizon seems to work best. I had AT&T for several years and I have had lots of dropped calls. The voice/data plan with apple to apple comparison is also cheaper for Verizon.<br />The Winner - Verizon and thus Droid<br /><br />So far I'm impressed and very pleased with Motorola Droid.

A fantastic smartphone with minor issues
The Droid takes the already strong Android platform and matches it with hardware worthy of the system.  Android has been around over a year now.  There are some very nice Android phones - the G1 & the Hero by HTC most notably.  Droid blows them all away.<br /><br />First and foremost, Droid has a beautiful screen.  Its large (3.7"), high resolution (854x480, true 16:9 widescreen).  The capacitive touch is very responsive.  When you pick up the phone, you'll immediately notice two things - 1) the build quality is fantastic 2) the phone is rather heavy.  The extra weight is likely caused by the higher quality materials used to construct the phone, and considering how remarkably thin it is for a qwerty-slider, that's really not a bid deal, in my opinion.  The sliding mechanism is simple and feels solid, with no side-to-side play.  The keyboard itself is not the best - other HTC phones like the G1 and Touch Pro 2 have superior keyboards.  The keys are flat, which is necessary to make the phone so thin, but the layout is not ideal - they are aligned in a perfect grid, not offset like a standard keyboard.  However, it is still far superior to a touch screen keyboard.  Droid is also powered by a beefy Cortex A8 processor - the same architecture that runs the iPhone 3GS and Palm Pre.  It is considerably faster than the older ARM11 processor in other Android/HTC/Motorola phones.  Don't be fooled - the ARM11 528MHz processor is not even in the same realm is the A8 550MHz processor.  MHz numbers don't tell the whole story.<br /><br />The software in the Droid is also very strong.  It is the first Android 2.0 device on the market.  Android is really an underrated platform - it is very powerful, very easy to use, and has a huge number of apps on the Android Market.  No, the total does not come close to the Apple app store - but how many variations of the fart app do you really need?  When it comes down to it, with somewhere around 10-20k apps on the Market, there really is an app for just about everything you'd want to do.  Also worth noting, most of those apps are from the pre-Droid era - now that we've got a mass-marketed Android device on the largest network, the Market will likely see an explosion of even more.  The apps really are useful too, not just gimmicky - a brief list of useful apps is listed before.  I've seen complaints over apps being stored in-memory and not on the memory card - this is less of an issue than you think.  The core executable is stored in the 200MB or so of onboard storage - images, media, and other, bigger parts of an app are downloaded directly to the 16GB SD card.  I have dozens of apps on my Droid and I still have 175MB free.<br /><br />Call quality on the Droid is very good.  I used the Touch Pro 2 on Verizon for about a month prior to the Droid, and reception was considerably better.  In areas where I'd only get 1 bar of service, the Touch Pro 2 would cut out and drop calls, whereas the Droid is strong and clear pretty much everywhere.  Also worth noting, I have never had a phone that obtained a GPS fix faster than Droid - fire up Google Maps and almost immediately your location is pinpointed.  Data service over the Verizon EV-DO network is snappy, and I get 3G coverage everywhere I go.<br /><br />On the subject of Google Maps - along with Android 2.0, Droid is also the first phone to have Google's free turn-by-turn navigation system.  This is a great addition, although it should filter its way to other systems with time - in fact, Google has already released this update for Android 1.6 devices.  The voice-guided navigation is not perfect, and does not rival a dedicated system, but for the price, it really is a great product, and it will only improve with time.<br /><br />The included camera is not perfect.  I have not had the autofocus issues others have complained about, but picture quality is definitely a little washed out - I was spoiled by the great Carl Zeiss 5MP camera on the N95, I haven't had a cell phone rival it yet.  Video recording, on the other hand, is very good.  Sharp, smooth video with rich color reproduction.  Its amazing that they were taken by the same lens.<br /><br />Battery life is actually decent with Droid.  One thing you must realize, if you haven't used a smartphone before, is that ALL data-enabled smartphones have poor battery life.  That said, Droid is slightly above average here.  I almost always can go the entire day without charging, which is pretty good considering I run gmail, exchange, facebook, twitter, weather, sports, stocks, and more in the background all day.  Android includes a useful tool that shows you what is using the battery (by %).  So far, it seems that the 3G radio is actually very battery-efficient.  I can run Pandora for hours and hardly dent my battery.  However, wifi drains it pretty hard, and the big screen is a HUGE battery guzzler, even with the brightness turned down. <br /><br />There are also some cool accessories for Droid.  The car dock holds the phone (very securely I might add) onto your dashboard, and brings you into "car home" mode, with easy access to voice search (which works great), maps, navigation, contacts, etc.  Combine the car dock with the standard headphone jack in your car to Navigate while streaming Pandora to your car's stereo system simultaneously.  Get a call?  Pandora cuts out, your car speakers become a speakerphone.  Works great.  There's also the multimedia dock, which turns Droid into an alarm clock/multimedia/weather station.  Both are nice. <br /><br />In summary, the Droid is a great smartphone on a great network.  It is not perfect - the keyboard and camera could both be a little better, battery life is good but not great, but you won't find a better smartphone on Verizon - and depending on what you look for in a phone, you may not find a better phone on any network.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Big, sharp screen<br />-Blazingly fast processor<br />-Android 2.0<br />-Good browsing experience<br />-Free turn-by-turn voice navigation<br />-Huge number of apps on the Android Market<br />-Decent battery life<br />-Very solidly built<br />-Physical keyboard<br />-Very thin for a phone with slide out keyboard<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Keyboard could be improved<br />-Camera shots are somewhat washed out<br />-No multitouch in native apps (although apps downloaded from the Market do have Multitouch - its a software thing, not a Droid thing)<br />-A bit heavy<br /><br />Some of my favorite apps:<br />-Better Keyboard, a replacement for the on screen keyboard.  WAY better than the stock Android keyboard<br />-AppSwipe, Slightly more powerful task manager than included<br />-Dolphin Browser, Adds multitouch, gestures, and some nice interface touches to the default browser<br />-Twidroid, by far the best Twitter app on Android<br />-Key Ring Rewards, stores all of your store cards (Safeway, QFC, Petco, Blockbuster, etc).  Don't carry around a dozen cards, just pop open Key Ring Rewards and it displays the scannable UPC<br />-Listen, made by Google, downloads/finds/plays podcasts<br />-My Tracks, also made by Google, works with Google Maps & GPS, tracks information about runs/walks/drives with speed, distance, etc<br />-MotoTorch LED, uses the camera's LED flash as a flashlight<br />-Quote Pro, the best stock app on Android<br />-Pandora, free streaming music<br />-Pure Grid Calendar, a nice home screen widgit for your calendar<br />-Shazam, listens to music playing and tells you what song it is<br />-SportsTap, the best sports scores/stats app on Android<br />-TasKiller, kills all running apps to free up memory<br />-Weather Widgits, gives you an HTC Sense-style weather flip clock widgit

I swtiched from AT&T/iPhone...and LOVE the Droid!!!!!!!!!!!
I went over to AT&T about 13 months ago to get the iPhone. I was so excited at the time, thinking the iPhone was the next best thing. It was everything I wanted for a while, until I realized how horrible AT&T's service is. Dropped called, poor service and poor customer service were just some of the problems I encountered. Not only that, but Apple is not the best when it comes to open development of their products and software. We have all heard horror stories about Apple preventing apps from being placed on the market for absolutely stupid reasons. Well, have no worries, because Google and Motorola are hear to save you.<br /><br />I was in New York this past week and while I had full bars in the city, none of my calls would through on my iPhone and the calls that did go through, dropped after a few seconds. Needless to say, it was time to switch. I walked into the Verizon store two days ago and got the Droid. The people couldn't have been nicer. The phone is amazing. Sure, the Android OS is not as polished as the iPhone's OS, but it definitely still gets high marks in my book. There are great apps for the Droid and there are even widgets that you can put on your home screens. The screen is incredible, probably the nicest screen on the market. The phone is fast too and I love that it can run more than one application at a time. Just by holding down the Home button, you can move to one of your most six recent apps. <br /><br />The internet browser is awesome. The phone has the ability to handle multiple browser pages (tabs..sort of) and has incredibly fast load times. Also, Android will be getting Flash support soon (something that Apple has not allowed for the iPhone). <br /><br />This is the best phone I've had yet and it's on the best network. I would highly recommend this to those people who are fed up with AT&T and Apple, or those Verizon customers who have been waiting for an iPhone worthy competitor.

Outstanding!!!!
This is my first Smartphone, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess if you are used to using something else, of course you will not like anything that is different.  I love the design.  It stays in my hands.  My friends are constantly dropping their curvy iphones.  The rubberized back, weight of the phone and the lip at the bottom allow me to use this phone with one hand, with the keyboard open or closed.  I love the keyboard, but again, I have never had a phone with a keyboard, so I can't compare it to others.  The design of this phone may not be stylish, but it is totally more functional than the curvy lightweight phones.  I hope they don't change the design.<br /><br />I see people complain about not having the the multi-touch pinch zoom. (this is actually available if you want it)  The one tap zoom is awesome and easy to use!  Pinch zoom is very awkward if you happen to have fingernails.<br /><br />The reception on this phone is amazing!  I live in the mountains and rarely got reception with my LG phone.  I had to hook it up to amplifiers & antennas to get a usable signal.  I don't have to hook this Droid up to my antennas to access the internet or make calls!  The signal is not great, but it's usable most of the time and it gets great reception hooked up to the antennas.<br /><br />This phone has eliminated my need for a net book.  It does everything my laptop does.  I have an internet business and always need to be checking up on things, answering emails, etc.  I no longer have to fire up my desktop or drag my laptop everywhere I go.  The droid is like a pocket laptop, a phone, a mp3 player, a GPS and more, I love it!<br /><br />The battery life is no different than my LG that had an extended battery.<br /><br />I have had no problems at all with this phone.<br /><br />It comes with a home charger, that has a USB data cable that plugs into it.  So you can also use the cable to hook up to your computer.  The cable also charges the phone when it is hooked up to your computer.  I can also use the cable with my ZEN car charger that has the same USB plug in design.  Thanks Motorola!

Finally, a Fully-Featured Phone for Verizon
Let me preface by saying that I've been on Verizon for about 4 years now and was seriously considering switching to another carrier simply because of Verizon's practice of crippling their devices.  While I can't complain about their coverage, call quality, or dropped calls, I was miffed by the fact that for almost 2 years, I had a Blackberry 8830 that had no GPS, no WiFi, and no MMS.  No GPS because Verizon wants to charge you $10/mo for VZ Navigator.  No WiFi because they want you to use their data services.  No MMS because no on-board camera must obviously mean that I wouldn't want to receive picture messages if I can't take pictures of my own.<br /><br />Enter the Motorola Droid. It not only has GPS, it has turn-by-turn text-to-speech navigation through Google Maps Navigation.  It is WiFi-capable.  And, it has a camera that can take 5MP stills and capture NTSC-resolution video.  Ok, fills the 8830 voids, so does it have its own?  Well, the 8830 was GSM-capable and the Droid isn't, but unless you travel internationally, a lot, then this shouldn't be a problem.  Also, tethering isn't available yet, but should be in 2010.<br /><br />Transitioning from a Blackberry?  Chances are you are concerned about 3 things: email, calendar, and contacts.  <br />- If you already use Gmail for email, then there's nothing you have to do for that.<br />- Use Outlook for your calendar?  Google has a sync utility that you can install to your computer running Outlook.  It's capable of doing 2-way sync or 1-way (either Google -> Outlook or Outlook -> Google).<br />- Sync contacts?  This took some work.  I had several contacts in Google via Gmail and several contacts on my Blackberry.  I used Blackberry Desktop Manager to export my contacts to a CSV (you might need to search around to find out how, it's not very intuitive and varies by Desktop Manager version).  I merged that CSV in with my exiting contacts in Google Contacts and went through a process of manually merging duplicate contacts and having to move data to the appropriate fields because there was a mismatch in field names.  Most of the phone numbers and emails that I had stored in my Blackberry wound up in the Notes section of each contact.  For the 150 or so contacts that I imported, it took maybe an hour to clean everything up.  Not too bad for a one-time thing.  If you have contacts in Outlook, it might be easier to merge since, at the very least, Google allows you to export to a format readable by Outlook.<br /><br />Since I had already synced my calendar and contacts ahead of time, I linked it to my Google account with all of my email, contacts, and calendar entries and within 5 minutes of activation, I never had to turn my Blackberry on again.<br /><br />Other stuff (not a comprehensive list by any means):<br />- The WebKit HTML5 Browser is gorgeous and fast.  When viewing pages in landscape mode, most sites are readable and look as they would on a computer.  Navigation and image pop-ups function very well, and even online shopping is doable.  For example, while amazon.com defaults to their mobile page, there's a link to their main site.  If you follow it, it should look very familiar.  I went to the Gold Box deal page and was amazed to see that the Lightning Deals were there and the counter was counting down.<br />- GPS/Navigation is the best I've seen from a phone.  Direction recalculation was quick.  If you're listening to music, it will pause to give the next step in the directions.<br />- App interaction is slick.  You can look up a pizza place on Google Maps and add it as a contact, then make it your destination in Navigation.<br />- There's an app called "Car Home" that puts everything you would need while driving available for fast access: Voice Search, Navigation, Map View, Contacts, and Search<br />- The home screen is actually 3-wide.  It's like having 3 separate desktops for shortcuts and widgets.<br />- The audio player is pretty basic, which is fine with me.  No EQ (This is a good thing. As a music/audio production nut, I would recommend buying good headphones as opposed to coloring the sound with EQ settings).  There is a player widget that you can put on your home screen, which is good for use in the car.<br />- I tried Google Docs in the browser and it worked.<br />- No Google Wave yet.<br />- Webmail is OK.  I linked my basic Hotmail account.  It pulls new messages but does not do any reconciliation of deletions or read messages from phone -> account.<br />- I've gotten used to the virtual keyboard to the point where I don't use the physical one for anything.<br />- Battery life is great.  After heavy use (playing music, browsing the web, demoing the apps a couple times, making a few calls) almost nonstop for 8 hours, I had 60% of the battery left.  If you can't figure out where your battery life is going, you can go into the phone info menu and it shows you power consumption by app.  In most cases, the screen will be about half of your total battery consumption.<br />- For those interested in writing apps, I downloaded the SDK and Eclipse plugin with ease.  Java is the flavor.  There are emulators for the different releases of Android.<br /><br />For the wow effect, I would recommend Google Sky Map, Google Goggles, and Compass.  All of which are free.<br /><br />How does it compare to the iPhone?  Is it an iPhone killer?  Who cares?  After using this phone for 72 hours, I haven't found much that it can't do.  It's intuitive and lets me leave the netbook and a dedicated mp3 player at home.<br />

The Droid Experience
After looking through the many Droid reviews on Amazon, I saw a lot of talk about customizability but not enough examples.  This review is intended to illustrate exactly why customizability is so important to many of us happy Droid owners.  I also want to give people who are new to both smart phones and the Google experience an idea of what it was like to transition to that world.  But mostly, I just want to add my perspective to the mix.<br /><br />Life Before Droid:<br /><br />I had a Verizon Moto Razr.  Loved the light weight, hated the battery life (having to charge the phone every other day).  Loved the voice and reception quality (at first, but reception deteriorated over the years).  Hated the Verizon calendar and the lack of a useful home screen appointment reminder feature (and the fact that appointments would shift on their own by one hour--a bug Verizon never fixed).  Hated the call reminder beep every five minutes (but refused to disable it because I needed that reminder).  Liked notes but hated the limited notes features and most of all, hated the lack of backup of all my contacts and notes (My Verizon services came late to the game, and in any case I wanted better portability).  Oh yeah--loved the voice dial.<br /><br />What I Wanted:<br /><br />My background is in IT and Windows, so I was a heavy user of Outlook.  I wanted a "Today" screen.  I also needed to be able to share emails with my work Outlook, but not all of them.  I did, however, want all of my personal emails to go to my phone.  Here were my priorities:<br /><br />1) Better than average voice, speaker, and reception quality.<br /><br />2) Synch of all contacts data with an external, portable data storage area.<br /><br />3) A satisfying internet browsing experience.<br /><br />4) Emails and calendar with a Today screen.<br /><br />5) Better than average battery life for a smart phone.<br /><br />6) A decent notes app, a voice recorder, a password keeper, etc.<br /><br />7) A decent photo and video camera.<br /><br />What I Got:<br /><br />I tried the iPhone just long enough to determine that it failed my expectations for voice quality.  I am a stickler that a smart phone is primarily a phone, so it better perform well as a phone!<br /><br />I also saw a friend's Palm Pre and the interface was annoyingly slow, so add snappy performance to the list.<br /><br />Finally bought the Droid.  At first, I was annoyed by the physical keyboard.  The weight didn't bother me at all (until I picked up a Droid Eris).  The touch-lag on the screen was never an issue, as I found that the Droid was actually pretty snappy compared to other touch phones (until I compared it with an iPhone).<br /><br />With the Droid, I initially met all of the above objectives, except 6 and 7.  That is, I would have to find the apps and customizations I needed and the photo camera was not great (videos looked ok, though).<br /><br />A Google calendar Today widget came already installed on the Droid.  It only showed the next appointment, so I thought I might want to find a better widget from the app store (turns out later the stock widget was my preference after all).  Clicking on the widget took me to my calendar or my task list, so I was pretty happy with it.<br /><br />After seeing how Blackberry phones were an absolute failure when it came to browsing, I was extremely happy with the Droid's Google Chrome browser.  I know the phone is not as fast as the iPhone, but it has better overall speed and quality than just about anything else.  The Droid display is second to none, and really adds to your browsing experience.  In comparison with my friend's iPhone, you could easily read fine print on my display that you would have to zoom on his.  The iPhone also had a strong blueish tint to its screen.  My friend said my Droid had a yellowish tint, but it looks all white to me. ;-)<br /><br />Speaking of zooming, Droid handles automatic zooming and formatting of the text column very well (others say better than iPhone), and with Android v2.1, it has multi-touch.  That's not to say there aren't some bonehead omissions on Google's part, such as the lack of zoom when reading emails.  I hope they fix that soon.<br /><br />As for battery life... I had adjusted my expectations that I would need to plug-in the Droid every night and possibly during the day if I used some of its features (ahem, games) heavily.<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />I knew from the reviews that synching with Outlook was problematic to impossible, so I opened a gmail account instead and setup my home Outlook client to download but not delete emails (my phone would be where I permanently deleted my mail).  I then altered my email router settings  (You don't use an email router service?  You should!) so that my mail would transparently go to my gmail account instead of my ISP account.<br /><br />I exported all my personal Outlook contacts and imported them into Google.  It was a piece of cake!  I had used many Outlook folders before, so I had to find the equivalent in Google.  Eventually, I managed to categorize all of my contacts.  After backing-up my Outlook contacts, I then deleted them from Outlook and imported the ones from Google.  It was seamless and, apart from some very minor data issues, proved to me that I could rely on Google as my main contact database and import them into Outlook whenever I needed to update my local computer.<br /><br />So now I was ready to setup my phone.  After entering my gmail account in the phone, everything synched fine.  All of my Google emails were pushed to the Droid and when I deleted them on the Droid, they were deleted on the Google database.  All of my contacts, with thumbnail pictures, showed up on my phone.  There, too, modifying a contact would propagate the change to the Google database, so the change was permanent.<br /><br />I tried forwarding an Outlook calendar appointment from my work computer to my Google account.  The Droid received the email and I promptly deleted it.  And within a few seconds I would see the appointment in my calendar and on my Today widget.<br /><br />Now I tried to setup the wireless interface.  My wireless router uses encryption and I had a lot of problems getting everything working, but eventually I figured out that there is a flaw in my router when I use both wireless G/N (I have a D-Link router).  I simply set it to G only and the Droid had no problem connecting.  On the many public wireless sites, the Droid connects easily and performance is of course fantastic on wireless (although with a good 3G signal, performance is not too bad either).<br /><br />Life After Droid:<br /><br />Sometimes my Droid shows a koi pond as its wallpaper, with a realistic water animation--the rocks and koi waver and ripple as if it was a video.  Other times it will show a stretch of wet sand at the beach, with a foamy wave that ripples up and down.  It also randomly shows several other scenes that I found to work well with the animated water effect.  This is thanks to an app I downloaded that runs on Android 2.1 [Waterpaper Live Wallpaper].  At one point however, I found the app to run a little choppy.  And after adding Google Earth, I started to experience some serious home screen freezing and refresh delays of many seconds.  But then I realized my Droid was starved for internal memory and was spending too much time clearing space to run the home screen.  So I removed Google Earth and a few other apps, bringing my free internal memory up from 60MB to 100MB.  That resolved the home issues and made everything perform snappier than ever.  It really is too bad they don't store the apps on the SD card, as that would address this problem.<br /><br />When I want to voice-dial, I just hold down the camera button and it works (albeit a little slowly) the same as on my Moto Razr--but with deadly accuracy.  The stock Droid was an epic fail when it came to voice dial, but I found a much more accurate voice dial app [Voice Dialer HF] and another app [Button Shortcut] to link any function to my camera button, and tadaaa!--one-click voice dial.<br /><br />When I miss a phone call or email, the LED light blinks (pink for phone call, green for email) and I get the notification ringtone alert once every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours, after which it shuts up.  Niiiiice.  This customizability was thanks to yet another app [Missed Reminder].<br /><br />I'm making a call to an acquaintance in China.  As soon as I've dialed the number, the display assures me that the Google Voice service will be used for the international call instead of direct dial (which is the default action for all U.S. calls).  I'm saving money and I didn't have to dial the Google Voice number first or use a special app interface to dial out--the feature worked transparently as soon as I configured the Google Voice app.  And I don't ever worry about my phone going on standby during the call and having to unlock my screen just to get back to the dialer, even though I set the screen timeout to 30 secs.  That's because the KeepScreen app prevents the timeout for any set of apps I specify (including the phone app).<br /><br />I'm stepping outside my car and need to quickly note the parking location in this huge parking garage.  On my Droid, I just touch a widget and I'm instantly recording a voice note.  The same app that does voice recording also keeps my text notes, drawings, checklists, and AES 128-bit encrypted passwords, in a tree-structured folder system.  I highly recommend this app [Note Everything]!<br /><br />Oh, and I got used to the keyboard.  ***Addendum 3/12 *** But I also downloaded a new keyboard app.  It's a port of the HTC touch keyboard, and is available from several of the Android app library sites, but you may not find it in the official app store.  It not only does calibration so you make fewer fat finger mistakes, but it allows voice-to-text input at any time in the middle of typing.  In fact, I used it now to complete this paragraph.  Actually, voice-to-text is now a standard keyboard feature in Android 2.1, but I still prefer this alternate keyboard.<br /><br />There's more--a lot more.  I'll stop now.  I love my Droid.

Best Phone I have ever used
I have been in the wireless industry for the last 12 years.  I actually sold the old school bag phones that you had to plug into your car.  Through the years I have had phones that I like, phones that I hate, and phones that I love.  The Droid is definetly one of the phones that I love.  Usually with smart phones you get a really good PDA or a really good phone. The really great smart phones meld the two together to make it a truly special device.  This phone has made my life easier by combining tasks that I normaly used several differant devices for into one handy device.  Whne I went back to my iPod Touch I found that the sceen seemed dim and not as easy to look at.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Battery life is very good for smart a phone<br />* Wonderfuly bright and vibrant screen<br />* Excellent audio quality both incoming and outgoing<br />* Mobile web browser that is great(yes even without multitouch)<br />* Android 2.1 and all the feats that come with it especially the Navigation and Google Maps<br />* Simple to us Music Player<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Keyboard is too small<br />* Bluetooth seems to be finicky<br />* Charging port is too small<br />* Heavey (my arm actually gets tired holding this to my head all day)<br /><br />If you are ready to make the leap to a smart phone and are ready to pay extra for the monthly service this is by far the best phone that Verizon currently offers.

Significantly Awesome with ongoing promise
I finally traded in my Samsung SCH-i760 for this phone, and I can honestly tell you that I will never look back.  I have never owned an iphone, so I cannot provide that comparison, but if you have already sold your soul to Verizon but are using a non-3G or (especially) an old 3G device, go buy this one now.  I am actually still trying to break the habit of closing apps to free up space - because on this phone it's been totally unnecessary thus far.  The quality of the applications are very good, and the android market make it easy to determine (by using customer reviews) which solutions are the best for you.  <br /><br />A few of my favorite things I can do with this device (So far...): <br />-Enjoy an very crisp screen with excellent touch performance<br />-Speak rather than type text messages, search terms, and anything else! (TalktoMe Keyboard for $0.99 USD)<br />-Use Google Voice an/or Visual Voicemail (FREE)<br />-Excellent email & Calendar syncing/management<br />-Listen to the radio, news shows, and podcasts<br />-Use FREE GPS Navigation with traffic that is constantly updated<br />-Read e-books (Aldiko application (FREE))<br />-Keep all of my shopper/discount cards (CVS, grocery, etc) logged in my phone rather than carrying or forgetting all of them (Key Ring FREE)<br />-Scan barcodes to conduct price comparisons, read reviews, and find coupons while shopping (Shopsavvy FREE and Mycoupons FREE)<br />-If I lose my phone, I can send it a text and it will turn up the volume and ring for a specified duration while I search for it! (Where's my droid FREE)<br /><br />Other positive notes: <br />-The battery charges quickly (~1.5-2 hours from fully drained)<br />-5mp camera, while it won't compete with a real camera (with bigger lens, etc), is pretty good for a thin/small phone camera<br />-The 3G connection seems to work much faster than my older phone<br /><br /><br />The Cons <br />- The keyboard is not very good, but it's not terrible.  The touch keyboard actually works well, swype has a beta version out for andriod, and with the TalktoMe application, I don't type much anyway!<br />- The phone has so many uses, I do have to keep my USB cable handy for a quick charge  <br />-If you are a slingbox user, there is not yet a slingbox application for android

My DROID Story and complete review
Hello and thanks for checking out my review on the Motorola Droid.  Let me begin by setting the stage.  I was a 10 year T-Mobile customer with a Sony Ericsson K700i up until four days ago.  The K700 was pretty beat up and I was paying an arm and a leg for my service because I was on the basic plan.  I didn't want to upgrade my plan with T Mobile because that would mean I would create a contract extension.  Knowing I was going to jump ship at some point I didn't want to do that.  Having the basic plan was not good because with all of the text messaging I was doing my monthly bill would add up.  I really wanted to wait for the HTC HD2 and then saw the Sony Ericsson X10 (Rachel) and fell in love.  However, at the time there was no indication as to when these two phones would come out in the States and what carrier they would go with (if any).  ALL my friends have the iPhone.  It is an amazing phone and has all of the features that I want in a device.  I just didn't want to be a sheep - Follow the crowd.  I am 39 years old and have never been like that so why start now.  I find it so interesting how defensive iPhone owners are of their phone especially when a potential competitor appears.  While visiting Best Buy I saw the Droid. I had heard about the open platform Android OS and really didn't know what it was all about.  I really liked the feel of the phone in the store but at that time moved on.<br />Some time after my two year old daughter was playing with my K700 and she threw it.  It cracked the screen and the joystick wouldn't work so great after that.  However the phone still worked - it was just a pain to operate. I then decided it was time - I needed a new phone. <br /><br />I ordered the Droid with a one year contract because I figured in a year if I didn't like the phone I can just change it.  I was able to port my T Mobile number to Verizon and order the phone with ease.  Ordering through Verizon online was very easy and I did it that way because I knew I would have to set up an online account at some point anyway.  Along with the phone I got the docking station which I will discuss later.  When my phone arrived two days later I was amazed!  Here is why:<br /><br />The design:<br />The phone is all metal with just the battery cover plastic.  Because of this the phone has some nice weight to it and feels solid in your hands.  The screen is gorilla glass and is smooth and tough.  At first I wished they went with silver or chrome instead of the gold trim but you really get used to it and only three items are this color -> The speaker grille, shutter button for the camera and the directional pad on the keyboard.  There is a 5MP camera with dual LED flash and a nice sliding out keyboard.  The phone is only 1mm thicker than the iPhone yet has a bigger 3.7 inch screen rather than the 3.5 incher on the iPhone.  Also, it's resolution is higher at over 800x400.  The phone has a lot of sensors: accelerator, ambient light, proximity, ect.  It knows when it's up to your ear and shuts the screen off to conserve battery.  Equiped with WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and 3G - you will always be connected and Verizon's service has been amazingly good - coverage everywhere!  Pre-loaded with a 16GB micro SD card (upgradeable to 32 GB) is so nice.  Removable battery is sweet too.  I like the shape and design - it's simple yet very sci-fi-ish and really looks like an Android - hard to explain in words.  A word about the processor: it is clocked down from 600 to 500 but this thing smokes through whatever you throw at it.  Very nice to have since I really wanted that 1ghz snapdragon on the X10 and HD2.  Feew!<br /><br />Keyboard:<br />The sliding keyboard isn't as great as I would like it to be.  Sliding it isn't hard but there is not any spring mechanism to assist - it's all manual.  The keys are a bit cramped, flat and typing on it isn't so great but it is nice to have the keyboard. With my finger nails I can type but with finger tips I tend to misspell words.  The Droid offers two other options though - on screen keyboards in both portrait and landscape and both give you prediction text options which is nice.  I can type very fast using the on screen keyboards and that is just great for texting and replying to emails or searching on the internet. I should note this is the thinnest phone to have a full qwerty keyboard.  I say it is nice to have the keyboard because there is always potential for it even if it isn't the greatest to use.  Kinda like having a gun, better to have one and not need it than to need it and not have it.  <br /><br />Screen:<br />It's beautiful!  Whether surfing the internet, viewing photos or videos the screen alone is worth the price.  I have the Zune HD and love the AMOLED.  However this Droid is perfect with what it has and I am sure the next version will have an AMOLED and will be just as good.  Fast too!  Switching from screen to screen and running apps and checking emails and SMS's fast fast fast!  No lag. There is a green light that will flash intermittently when you have a message either SMS or email or voice.  Very nice touch.  Switching from portrait to landscape transitions smoothly and quickly. As I said earlier Motorola used gorilla glass for the Droid and it is smooth and tough.  This is a capacitive touch screen.  It is so sensitive, the slightest touch will activate whatever you are pressing - very nice and strong. Also, it will not accidentally activate something you touch like if you are swiping screens.  It highlights it, kinda like the Storm but not, and then carry's out you swipe.  There are three quick launch screens: imagine the home screen with a screen to the left of it and a screen to the right.  You can customize backgrounds and the apps posted here.  Anything you don't get on these three screens can be found on the Android launcher tab.  You just pull it up with a swipe and the icons appear.  You can now just scroll through and find whatever you are looking for.  I have to say the touch screen is a pleasure to use.  Also, there are four capacitive buttons on the bottom of the screen.  A back button, menu button, home button and search/magnify.  I find them easy to use and they have haptic feedback which is cool. You feel a slight vibration when you touch any of these buttons.  Some find that they are in the way - I have not found this to be a problem nor have I accidentally pressed them. <br /><br />Android Market and APPS:<br />The iPhone has over 200,000+ apps.  They say Android only has about 16,000+.  BIG DEAL!  Click the market app on the screen and spend a few hours browsing - its incredible!  I have downloaded so many apps many are the same apps the iPhone has - many are some the iPhone will NEVER have because Android is open source not restricted like Apple enforces on the iPhone.  I LOVE IT!  You can even BUMP with an iPhone if you want.  I have Shazzam, UTube, Twitter, Pandora, Facebook, Google maps, Lightsaber, Compass, the lighter app thing, fart app, ect ect ect - anything the iPhone can do Droid can do and more!  It's that good.  I have customized my phone to suit my liking and it is just wonderful - I am so happy.  I wanted that retro clock with the weather thing that the HTC has - guess what?  I got it now - downloaded it!  My friends try to stump me with an app that the iPhone has and I am always able to find one on the Android market that does the same thing.  It's really that damn good i tell you!  I can spend a year telling you about how great the apps are - you just have to experience it.  Some apps are free and others range from $0.99 to whatever.  The choices are endless and to say that a market is better than another market because of the number of apps each has is just plain stupid.  Why you say?  How many apps do you really want?  All 200K?  I don't think so, you are given many choices and that is what i like - freedom to pick what I want and enjoy.  <br /><br />Camera:<br />5MP quick auto focusing with LED flash and video.  Nothing really to say other than that!  It takes great pictures.  Inside where it is darker some photos tend to be too dark even with the flash but you have to get a little closer to the subject.  The zoom feature is really nice too.  I have an app now that lets you color pictures you take and edit them add things and what not.  Pictures and video can be easily stored, edited and sent to friends via, SMS, MMS, twitter, facebook, email, ect, ect.  There is a physical shutter button which is nice as you can half press it and the camera goes into action focusing so it is ready for a quick snap.  There is also an on-screen button for taking a picture.  Hey, I have a Sony DSC-W300 and a Canon DSLR for the prize photos - this camera on the Droid is just one more thing to make you love it not criticize how it should be equal in quality as a Sony or Canon.  <br /><br />Emails, SMS, MMS:<br />I was able to link to Gmail, AOL and Yahoo in seconds!  All are at my disposal and there is a notification bar at the top of the screen which you can pull down and see what messages you have or email and go to them directly with a click.  This is what I always wanted and now have - access to all email clients - I am now connected and can never miss being contacted by any means. I also have the visual voice mail which is simple yet practical.  I am now connected as my friends are with Blackberry's - that says a lot. <br /><br />Docking Media Station:<br />Charges the battery and changes the Droid into a media station showing time and weather - acts as an alarm clock and lets you slideshow pictures - just plain amazing and all the while it looks so nice in the doc - shinny black with silver metal - very classy and stylish.  I would recommend this accessory as it is a must if you own the Droid.  <br /><br />Media:<br />Like I said earlier I have the Zune HD and use it primarily for music.  However the Droid can play music in many ways.  First there is a 16GB micro flash card that you can put music and video on.  There is a 3.5mm headphone jack or you can use the external speaker.  Apps like Pandora and iMusic or Amazon MP3 and many others will make your head spin - it's all there for you and the Droid to use.  You do not need to rely on one type of media provider - enjoy the freedom.  Video from UTube is preloaded and there is a program that will play video of many types.  I hear flash is coming to Droid - not a surprise.<br /><br />Browser:<br />If you are a hard core Goggle user you will love the Droid but even if you are not you will love what this device has to offer.  They say the Droid doesn't have multi-touch because Apple is restricting it.  However, you can download the Dolphin browser app and have smooth multi-touch pinch zooming just like the beloved iPhone.  I have both browsers, the one that comes with the phone and Dolphin.  I have no problem with either.  The browser that comes with the Droid uses double tap to zoom in and out or you can use the (+) (-) zoom buttons - either way you have options and all work perfectly.  The browser is fast on the 3G network and WiFi works perfectly too.  Links in an email will pop up in seconds and you will find yourself gazing at the websites in awe as they look so crisp and clear with readable text and quick smooth scrolling.   <br /><br />Battery:<br />I have not had the 'battery cover sliding off' that people have reported.  It is covered in a rubbery type material but I have not had any problems with it.  I kinda like the fact that it is rubbery especially when taking pictures as you have a firm grip on the device.  As for the battery I use the phone a lot during the day and I commute via the train (MTA) and spend a lot of time using the phone browsing the internet and market place.  I always put the phone in the docking station at night and after a days use typically there is 3/4% battery life left.  I hope this helps you but if I had to take a guess I could probably go three or maybe four days of heavy use before I would have to charge it.  This is a guess but overall I am happy with the battery and like the fact that I can pop another one in if I needed to.        <br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Now I hear the X10 is coming to ATT and the HD2 is going to, well T-Mobile.  Do I now regret leaving T-Mobile?  NO. Do I now regret not waiting?  NO.  After a year and my contract is up will I change to another phone?  Right now I am so pleased and happy with the Droid I can't see myself changing phones for a long time.  I hear they are coming out with a new iPhone.  My friends are all excited but I tell them, "didn't you guys just get the new 3GS?"  They say, "yeah but the 'new' iPhone is coming out and it is going to be better than the Droid."  *silence*  I smile and say ugh, can you repeat what you just said? Hope this review helps and if you go with the Droid best of luck to you and I hope you find it just as enjoyable as I have.  Take care.....  <br /><br />UPDATE: 02/10/2010<br />So after a couple of months use of the Droid I have to say it is an amazing phone that is so capable of so many different tasks.  The apps are awesome and I browse the Android market daily.  <br /><br />Here are some of the problems I have encountered:   <br /><br />1) Huge problem.  There are two specs of dust under the glass.  After visiting the Verizon store and having them blow air into the phone they were not able to get the dust out.  I was told this is a common flaw in the phone and sometimes the air pushes it out sometimes it doesn't.  The dust gets in through the ear piece on top. I guess I can live with it but I am so OCD and it does bother me.  If you live in Connecticut DO NOT go to the store in the Connecticut Post Mall - they are a bunch of punks working there and are so unprofessional and useless.  They tried to say it was the screen protector - it is so obvious it is not.  The store in Orange was the best.  They identified the problem and knew what to do.  They appologized for the problem but could offer no solution.  My contract runs out in a year and this sole issue may cause me to get another phone.<br /><br />2) The camera hasn't been the greatest.  Pictures are blurry - you have to be real steady almost statue like when taking a photo. Some photos come out OK while others are not that great - It is a 50/50 shot in the dark - for a 5MP camera I expected better quality. Video is tricky also as it takes a couple of seconds to start after pressing the shutter button.  Sometimes you think you miss pressed the button and press it again which will actually make it stop taking video.  Some video is smooth but then choppy and it pixles out in some cases.  I had my phone lock up on several occasions just from use of the camera after my son was born.<br /><br />3) I just can't get used to the physcal keyboard.  I have really tried but the on screen keyboards I always use because the physical keyboard is just too cramped and the keys are hard to press unless you have needle fingers.  Also, when using the physical keyboard the predictive text feature is not active.  This makes it even hard to type fast and successfully.  I just use the on screen keyboard but feel the physical keyboard is like having an added feature that will never be used - such a shame.  <br /><br />4) Multi-touch - some apps have it now but it isn't as smooth as I would like.  I hope Android 2.1 will fix most of the issues - excluding the dust issue obviously. <br /><br />UPDATE: 02/14/2010<br />WOW - Verizon customer service email and called - they are shipping out a new Droid and were just amazing on the phone.  All info on the phone will transfer automatically to the new phone which is just great news to me - I will update as I go along - very impressed with Verizon as a new customer I am very happy.  Can't wait to get my new Droid - WOOT!

A serious iPhone challenger comes to Verizon
Many people have already reviewed the tech specs of the droid.<br />I used to own an iPhone until I moved to an area where AT&T does not exist.<br />The previous reviews are accurate and helpful, I suggest reading them.<br /><br />I will keep my review simple:<br /><br />I like the apps, the selection is good and they download very quickly (iPhone downloads are slow!)<br /><br />The speaker quality is excellent. (I use PandoraOne a lot, and it sounds great)<br /><br />The camera quality is impressive, 5.1 mp, video and still, a zoom function and it has a flash. (improvement over iPhone)<br /><br />The google/gmail sync is very convenient for contacts and calendar. <br /><br />The sync is automatic and does not require a USB connection to a computer. (iPhone does)<br /><br />I love the text to speech function, the GPS included on the phone can talk to me! (iPhone 3G does not have this feature)<br /><br />The charger cord is very very short. (micro USB)<br /><br />The phone is very heavy. This might be a problem in my scrubs pocket - but I'm on vacation right now!<br /><br />I do not like the preloaded ringtones. They are a little too froofroo for me. (pretty minor complaint, no?)

This phone is phenominal
I got a special deal from Verizon to upgrade early. I was having so many problems with my Blackberry Storm I walked into a Verizon Store to look at phones and spent about 3/4 of my time just looking at the Droid. I just could not put it down. I decided to buy it.<br /><br />I do not regret getting this thing one bit. In fact I am happier with this purchase than any other phone I have used. The device is slick and the physical + touch keyboard are great, The phone flies. I do not get any lag at all or choppiness.<br /><br />The GPS on this thing is great, it actually replaced my Garmin believe it or not. Takes a whopping 10 seconds for the signal to catch and get going sometimes less.<br /><br />Phone quality is great since it is on the Verizon Network, I do not get dropped calls.<br /><br />The Multimedia is almost perfect. I get no lagg at all hardly watching youtube videos. The app store is decent with many free apps to enhance the phone (I freak my family out in the dark using the strobe light app/flashlight). I have yet to try the music on this thing since I have a Itouch 2g for those purposes.<br /><br />Overall you will not be disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />

This is not an "iPhone killer" - it's an "iPhone substitute"
First, please, don't fall into the trap! Too many people hold a new phone up against the iPhone and automatically start to disqualify a discussion about it because of the term "iPhone killer"<br /><br />Nothing is going to kill the iPhone except the iPhone. Let's move on!<br /><br />This phone is an "iPhone substitute". It's a phone that you can carry around in your pockets and not feel weighted down. It's a phone that you can drop and not fear of seeing a dent. It's a phone that you can watch 16:9 movies on. It's a phone that runs Android 2.0, which is an operating system that is becoming much more user friendly.<br /><br />This phone has the "google experience" attached to it. Using the voice search has been accurate to a large degree. It finds homes and businesses in my small city correctly with only a few hiccups (retail stores being it)<br /><br />The phone looks techie, but, you can smooth it out with the right wallpaper and phone covers. The phone is great for people who like the feel of metal and not plastic. It feels like a light porous brick. If the keyboard wasn't there, it'll probably be the thinnest phone in America. <br /><br />Let's talk about the keyboard. First tries on both the physical and virtual keyboards will result in frustration. Give it a few hours...you'll master it. <br /><br />The Apps...ah, the apps. Slowly, they're pouring in. Of course the iPhone has 100k...they've been around for 3 years! Give the android platform another year and they'll be getting closer.<br /><br />Battery life is amazing. For the past few days I've been constantly on youtube, sportstap (app), browsing, pandora radio, google navigation, and of course checking my gmail....and haven't had the battery die on me yet. Only complaint is when charging, it doesn't specifically tell you how much life is left (ex: 80% instead of 84%)<br /><br />Screen is decent in the sun. Notification bar is a bit hard to pull down if you're a thumbs person but you can get used to it. Running multiple processes is something that a man can love. Ringtones aren't business/professional, but, you can easily upload an .mp3 version of whatever you desire.<br /><br />The best part though about this phone....VERIZON IS BARELY ATTACHED TO IT! Anyone that has had a Verizon phone before knows how they like to push their software on the phone. It's optional downloads right now and VCast isn't even standard yet. Beautiful! Makes it feel like an unlocked phone and not just a toy. <br /><br />The only negatives that are a concern would be the lack of software client for syncing music/movies (you must do it manually...but it does play almost anything) and the back cover of the Droid. Mine is prone to slip off with ease. I have a case on the way though.<br /><br />Overall....I'm a man that has tried a variety of phones - touch and non-touch - and I feel confident stating that you can have this phone and walk up next to an iPhone and not feel ashamed at all. Of course, if you want a beautiful phone with power that everyone has...you might want the iPhone. But, if you want something that is just like it but a different operating system and a physical keyboard...you got your phone!

DROID DOES
Let me start off by saying this phone changed my life. This is my first smartphone (had a sanyo M1 for 2 1/2 years before switching to Verizon).  I had been waiting for an iPhone killer for years or at least decent competition for years.  Microsoft wouldn't step up their game with the windows OS and no apps could begin to measure up to Apple's.  Google stepped up to the challenge with Android OS.  Their apps, design, and interface with the quality manufacturer Motorola together is nothing short of epic.  <br /><br />Pros: <br /><br />screen quality = amazing. best out there hands down, plain and simple. great for watching movies. use doubletwist to convert and sync your video media to your Droid.<br /><br />FAST: uses the same processor as the iPhone and there are task killer apps that can make it run faster by shutting down certain apps running in the background.  And if really want to get movin, you can "root" your phone and overclock the processor. I wouldn't recommend it though unless you know what you are doing.<br /><br />FORMATS: try watching AVI on your iPhone..yeah it doesn't work<br /><br />Runs multiple apps: I don't know how I functioned without this before <br /><br />Physical keyboard: Although it may be stiff, AT LEAST IT HAS ONE. Many smartphones are moving away from the idea of having a real keyboard.  However the Droid is the world's thinnest slide-out QWERTY keyboard phone out there<br /><br />16 gig card: Expandable up to 32 gb and comes pre-installed with a 16 gig. Who else is going to give you such a huge card WITH the opportunity to go even higher?...Apple probably never will<br /><br />5 MP camera: Can be slow when it comes to taking pictures but the quality is amazing. Almost makes you rethink the need for a real camera sometimes.  Has flash (and can be used as a flashlight with certain apps) and records video at 720 X 480.<br /><br />Removable battery: gives you the option to prolong your phone as we all know, all batteries lose charge eventually.<br /><br />File Managers: you can hook this phone up to your computer and see all the files and folders...unlike manipulative Apple.  You can drag and drop files/folders as you please<br /><br />Cons: <br />Cant surf and be on the phone simultaneously (not really Droid's fault more so Verizon's but one of the few things I could think of that I dont like about my phone).<br /><br />Keyboard: buttons are somewhat stiff and can be hard to mash at times<br /><br />Slide out screen is somewhat stiff, even though its given me no trouble it just isn't as smooth as the Samsung Moment<br /><br />Let me conclude this by saying I was once an apple fan.  However I grew tired of their tactics.  They get money from their customers by making them somewhat dependent on them.  The non-removable battery and internal memory and unable to upgrade characteristics really got to me after a year of my first Apple product (30 gig iPod).  It only works for like an hour off of a single charge now.  It's damn near useless.  They almost "make" you buy another one.  That's how they make money.  I was watching their products though.  Its 2010 and you're still doing non-removable battery? gtfoh  They also restrict access to you seeing your own files on your own device! I couldn't stand this and abandoned them for good.  What if someone told you as you bought a car that you could only drive it on Tuesday and Wednesday?  What if you were about to make a purchase on a TV and you were told you couldnt watch what you wanted to watch?  The point I'm trying to make is how can anyone tell me how I can use my product if I paid for it??? I was offended over time. <br /><br />The MOTO DROID is the first real iPhone killer or at least worthy competitor.  Simple people may flock to the iPhone.  However nerds, techies, and people who want their phone to do much more should really get the Droid.  It's almost like there was life before the droid, and then there is life after it

Luv my Droid!  Imperfections are minor.
I've had my Droid since its November 6, 2009 rollout, and have never regretted getting it.  I had been thinking of an iPhone, Blackberry, or one of the smart Nokias, but was so glad I waited for this.<br /><br />It's a power-hog, for sure, but swapping in a freshly charged battery is easy, and I have chargers in home, office, and car.  I particularly love the integration with Google -- maps, voice, search.  Ditto the way my Contacts integrate with my Facebook friends.  It might not have quite as many apps available as an iPhone (yet!) but come on, how many do you really need and plan to download?  I've found every app I need at the Android app Market, and everything I needed or wanted had at least satisfactory free version.<br /><br />Helpful hints:  at least one downloadable free browser (Dolphin, which features multi-touch pinch-screen sizing) is better than the "stock" browser, and there's at least one free downloadable Facebook app that's notably better than the stock Facebook app included with the phone.  A Firefox mobile browser for Android is reportedly just around the corner, as is Flash.<br /><br />Also keep in mind the great included GPS Navigatgor is only as good as the current Google maps.  It might not pick up recent road changes.  But, it's all free - no maps subscription required.<br /><br />Thinks I don't like:  <br />1.  The slide-out keyboard is fair-minus at best.  Glad to have a slide-out, but this iteration needs a serious redesign.  Not conducive to thumb-typing!<br />2.  The initial Verizon docks (multi-media and car navigation) don't accommodate Droids with hard cases installed.  The front cover works OK, but I had to find one with an easy-to-remove back cover, which needs to come off to use the stock docks.  I'd prefer docks that can accommodate Droids with cases.

15 ways the Incredible beats the iPhone -- and 4 ways the iPhone is better
I had an iPhone and recently got the HTC Incredible. I loved the iPhone but hated AT&T. But I love the HTC Incredible even better than I loved my iPhone. Here's why.<br /><br />HTC Incredible advantages over iPhone ------------------<br /><br />Verizon - I got rid of my iPhone simply because AT&T is terrible here in New York. My sister and her husband in Washington DC got an iPhone over Christmas and they complain about the crappy service there too. Verizon is blazing fast, the best service in NYC.<br /><br />Widgets - Surprisingly the iPhone doesn't have widgets. The Incredible has some really cool widgets you can use. Widgets are like icons you can add to home screens, but instead of opening a program, the icon itself will give you info or have some other type of functionality like a a list of contacts or booksmarks you can access directly without opening a program first.<br /><br />Transfer files without iTunes - Whether you like iTunes or not, you are hamstrung using it with the iPhone. With the Incredible, transfer is simple. You connect the phone to your computer and you can copy over files to it.<br /><br />Connect it to as many computers as you want - I can connect to my computer both at home and at work, something you can't do with the iPhone. Apple annoyingly limits you to one computer to update your iPhone.<br /><br />Access the file system - Unlike the iPhone, you can copy, paste and delete files from the internal hard drive. You can also copy files from the hard drive to your computer--or any computer for that matter.<br /><br />Email - E-mail capabilities on the Incredible are better than the iPhone. In addition to global search, you can sort by conversation, sender, date, etc.<br /><br />8 megapixel Camera with flash - The 8 megapixel camera takes beautiful detailed shots, even better than the iPhone's camera, which actually takes really nice photos as long as it's not dark. The iPhone doesn't have a flash. The camera on the Incredible did crash a few times, a but I'm hoping they will work out in later versions. The Incredible camera is also really fast loading.<br /><br />Physical Camera button - The Incredible has a physical camera and video record button that works very well. With the iPhone you need to push a button on the touch screen, kind of annoying sometimes.<br /><br />Faster - The Incredible is blazing fast. There is rarely any lag in switching or loading programs. Very snappy.<br /><br />Mp3 player access without unlocking screen - When you're listening to music and you click the button to turn on the screen, you don't need to unlock the screen to see what music is playing. The iPhone has that as well. But unlike the iPhone, it also has usable back, pause and forward buttons on the locked screen.<br /><br />Editable dictionary - You can see and edit the keyboard dictionary yourself and choose what words you want in it.<br /><br />Send caller to voice mail - If you edit a user's contact, you have an option to always send that user to voice mail if you want. Minor, but kinda cool.<br /><br />Weather on calendar - When you flip through upcoming days on your calendar, it also displays the weather for that day. Pretty sweet.<br /><br />Google maps with layers - Android allows you to add `layers' to your map. For example, you can overlay the NYC MTA subway maps and see the actual subway lines. iPhone can't do that.<br /><br />Super thin - This phone feels thinner than the iPhone, and I think it is in some ways. It certainly fits in my pocket a lot nicer than the Motorola Droid, which felt about 1/3 thicker than the incredible.<br /><br />iPhone advantages over HTC Incredible ------------------<br /><br />Music audio quality - I loaded the same some songs on both the Incredible and the iPhone and listened carefully. The iPhone's music audio quality, without any EQ, is slightly better than the Incredible. It's not bad on the incredible, it just sounds slightly punchier across the audio spectrum on the iPhone. The Incredible does have better sound quality than the Motorola Droid, which I also tested.<br /><br />Equalizer - The iPhone has different equalizer settings. It's poorly implemented and easy to get low-end distortion but at least they have an EQ. No EQ on Android phones. Lame.<br /><br />Alerts - I like the way alerts and text messages pop up on the iPhone better than the Android. It feels like you need to dig too much to access new messages on the Incredible.<br /><br />Apps - Of course, the iPhone's app store is far more extensive than the Android's. 95% of the functionality I can still get on the Android, but apps for the Android are almost always made second to iPhone apps if at all.

Buy this phone !!
I got my Droid Incredible in the mail on Tuesday even though the release date is today (4/29).<br />The phone is stunning...with all the simplicity you'd expect out of a new smartphone and all the fun you'd expect out of a Google phone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Android OS and Sense<br />Customizable<br />Beautiful Screen<br />Android Market<br />8MP camera (shoots well in low light don't let anyone tell you different)<br />super fast processor<br />7 home screens that you can view by pinching.  You don't have to swipe through all 7.  Makes my friends jealous.<br />the browser is smooth and fast. Auto aligns text when you zoom.  uses multi-touch to pinch and zoom. Smooth scrolling and fast, fast load times.<br /><br />Cons<br />hard to sync any e-mail other than a gmail account<br />facebook app sucks, but i just made a bookmark to the full site, since the internet is super fast<br />optical trackpad is glitchy but i only use it for the camera<br />battery life...but Seidio is coming out with an extended battery so thats not going to be a problem soon<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Honestly, I have been waiting for a phone like this every since the iPhone.  I don't have AT&T and to be honest I just don't like Apple as a company.  They make cool stuff, but they rip their customers off.  This phone is an iPhone killer.  Compare them on all levels of performance, looks, functionality, customization, and speed and you'll find that the Droid Incredible is the same if not better.  Also, Verizon's coverage is fantastic, so don't be fooled by 4G.  I'm sure its great if you live somewhere where you get service.<br /><br />EDIT: (4/30) This phone eats RAM like crazy.  I installed "Advanced Task Killer" but I was still down to only 42M after a few days.  I would suggest downloading either "Task Manager" or "TaskPanel" (I have Task Manager and my boyfriend has TaskPanel on his Moto Droid and both work quite well).  I also suggest restarting the phone every few days just like you would a real computer.<br /><br />Other than that still no complaints   :)

Buy the HTC Droid Incredible!
I've had this phone since April 28th and I'm actually rewriting my original review using my HTC Incredible as my laptop's internet connection via EasyTether Lite (free).  I must say I'm really impressed with this phone.  It's super fast, good looking, and customizable.  It's a treat to finally have a great phone paired with a great network!<br /><br />It's got 7 screens, which can be viewed individually or all at once.  I've got mine setup like this:<br />1. Home/Main Screen - Weather and Top Used Apps (Pandora, Skyfire, Gmail, Market, Battery, Mint, Flixster, Camera)<br />2. Agenda<br />3. Text Widget from HTC Sense<br />4. Stock Widget from HTC Sense<br />5. Favorite Contacts<br />6. Power Widget and Empty Space<br />7. FriendStream - HTC Sense seemlessly integrated Facebook/Twitter/Flickr<br /><br />I don't intend for this review to be the end-all of reviews, so I'll try not to cover things other people did already.<br /><br />Something others have mentioned and I've noticed as well is that battery life could be better.  This is the one thing I would change if I could, and I might just do that.  It comes stock with the 1300 mAh battery as you can see in the specs below, which just barely cuts it for me.  I'm strongly considering upgrading the the Seidio 1750 mAh slim battery which fits in the same space, and should yield about 30% more charge for somewhere around 40 bucks here on Amazon.<br /><br />I didn't notice you can drag your finger from the top of your screen to see ongoing applications, and current notifications.  Hopefully this helps someone else figure this out too!  Someone showed me this a couple days in, and it's very nice.  Basically this is a quick link to what's just happened on your phone.<br /><br />One thing you might not notice right away is that the Android Market actually varies from other phones.  Specifically, it has some apps that other Android 2.1 phones don't have (ie 'Shake Them All' - a live wallpaper), while it's missing apps that other Android 2.1 phones have (Google Earth).  Both of the examples I noticed when comparing to the Motorola Droid, and I'm sure there are other differences.  This is a little irritating but one can get around this by downloading the .apk files and installing the programs manually.  I did this for Google Earth, and it runs flawlessly!  It's annoying that Google doesn't make it nice and easy.  You could also do something similar via Astro File Manager if both you and your friend use Astro, they could backup their app on microSD, give you the microSD, and you could install from there.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't see in my brief look through reviews is a list of free apps to get you started with brief descriptions:<br />Advanced Task Killer Free - Kill any application running<br />Astro File Manager - Manage Files, Backup Applications, Install Applications from Backup<br />BatteryTime Lite - Keep track of Battery Left, Battery Temperature<br />EasyTether Lite - Tethering App, free version does not access https sites, pay version does<br />Engadget - Tech Review Site Application<br />Flashlight - Simple help when you need it<br />Fring - Skype, Google Talk, AIM, Yahoo, Twitter, ICQ, SIP, and MSN Live Client (works on Wi-fi too unlike Skype's basic app)<br />Google Goggles - Cool app for image based google searches<br />Google Sky Map - Star Gazer App, based on phone location and phone orientation, shows what stars and planets are out there<br />Layar - Imagine Google Sky Map for restaurants, bars, etc.<br />MaplePaint - Painting App<br />Mint - [...] application for tracking finances<br />Movies/Flixster - Great movie app (theater and dvd) integrated with Netflix/Rotten Tomato, able to watch trailers instantly<br />My Verizon - Helpful for tracking phone usage<br />Pandora - Streaming Music<br />Scanner Radio - Police Scanner<br />Shazam - Figures out what song is playing<br />Skyfire - Slick web browser (or maybe you prefer Opera)<br />ShopSavvy - Barcode Scanner, Web and local price-checker<br />The Weather Channel - A good alternative to the Sense Weather Widgets<br /><br />Games I like (I'm a simple minded phone gamer, all free as well, no descriptions):<br />Action Potato<br />Jewels<br />Labyrinth Lite<br />The 'Papi' Series - PapiCatch, PapiJump, PapiMissile, PapiPole, PapiRiver<br />Super Tetris<br />Texas Holdem - Red Poker Club<br />Toss It<br /><br />Nerdy Details:<br />Size/Weight: 4.63 x 2.30 x 0.47 inches / 4.6 ounces<br />Screen: 480x800 3.7 inch AMOLED<br />Processor: 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon (QSD8650) CDMA version of Nexus One Processor (QSD8250)<br />Wi-fi: 802.11 b/g/n (I've clocked my phone on speed tests over 6 Mbps when connected to Comcast)<br />microSD: 2 GB included / up to 32 GB supported<br />Radio: FM using headphone cable as antenna<br />Operating System: Android 2.1 (Eclair) with HTC Sense<br />Camera: 8 Megapixels with Dual LED Flash<br />Bluetooth: 2.1 with A2DP Stereo and EDR;<br />GPS: A-GPS (Assisted GPS, can be used for locating you during a 911 call, or more commonly navigation)<br />Keyboard: Virtual Only<br />Speech to Text: Basically can dictate texts, web addresses, and almost anywhere you can type<br />Text to Speech: Google Navigation can speak directions<br />Network: Verizon!<br />RAM: 512 MB<br />ROM: 768 MB / 512 MB for user<br />Internal Storage: 8 GB moviNand<br />Battery: 1300 mAh Lithium Ion (checkout Seidio 1750 mAh slim which fits in same space, if you need more power)<br />Physical Buttons: Volume Control (up/down), Power/Lock (share same button), Optical Joystick (with click)<br />Additional Sensors: Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen, Ambient Light Sensor, 3-axis accelerometer, Digital Compass, Proximity Sensor<br />Audio Out: 3.5 mm stereo audio jack<br />USB: micro-USB (charging and data)<br />Audio file types supported: AAC, AMR0, OGG, M4A, MID, MP3, WAV, WMA<br />Video file types supported: 3GP, 3G2, MP4, WMV<br /><br />I'm excited to see this phone get rooted someday (soon?)!

Love it!!
This is my first smartphone having been a fence sitter with my old voice / text phone till now.  I'd been waiting in anticipation for Verizon to confirm / deny the rumors about the Nexus One since February.  Then I started reading online reviews / comparisons between the Nexus One and the newly announced Incredible and felt myself leaning more the the Incredible though the two phones are very similar.<br /><br />I was happily surprised when Verizon finally broke the silence and announced the availability of the Incredible.  And though I was only halfway through my New Every Two plan, upon my request Verizon graciously offered me the phone at the promotional $149 and then simply restarted my New Every Two the moment I activated this phone.  THAT'S good customer service.<br /><br />I've had the phone for over a week and I absolutely love it.  Yes there are grumblings about the lean battery life.  I won't lie, you do need to be prepared to charge it daily, especially for the first few days.  But you have to keep in mind it's a small computer that does REAL multitasking.  This is nothing new for those who have owned smartphones previously and does take a little getting used to by the basic voice / text phone crowd (my old voice / text phone went 8-9 days between charging).<br /><br />The battery is a tad undersized for the power of the phone but then again we consumers want a small, thin form factor.  Already there's a 1750 mAh battery available (exact same dimensions as the one it ships with) and rumors of an upcoming 2100+ mAh.  And remember, something you can do with this and most every non-Apple mobile device - easily carry a spare & swap / upgrade batteries.<br /><br />Following the advice on the Android forums, for the first few days I put my phone through full charge / discharge (till completely dead) cycles and have noticed a good 50% gain on battery life.<br /><br />The screen is gorgeous.  Because the phone does true multitasking you have a selection of animated backgrounds including a really cool swirling galaxy, blades of grass waving in the breeze, etc.  Touch sensitivity is great albeit a little too sensitive at times (a screen protector really helps in this area).  The multi-touch is great and while surfing the web, with most sites you can "drag zoom" (opposite of a pinch) text and pictures and then pan around - especially for those sites that prefer to use annoyingly small microfiche fonts.<br /><br />Voice quality is excellent - both what you hear and what your caller hears<br /><br />The speaker is decent for a phone but plug in a decent pair of headphones (uses a standard jack) and you have sound quality rivaling an iPod.  Plus the cord on the headphones acts as an antenna for the built-in FM radio.<br /><br />wifi setup is a breeze though with Verizon's unlimited data plan the biggest benefit to wifi connectivity is speed.  I find the range with my home network is as good as my laptop and the phone will automatically switch between known / configured wifi networks and the regular 3G network, with a preference for wifi over 3G.  When using the YouTube app, if you're connected on wifi it will automatically always try to get the highest quality version of the video.  If you're only on the 3G network then you have to tell the player to use higher quality (since it can take longer to load and possibly not stream as smoothly on 3G).<br /><br />I've been using the free Pandora app to stream internet radio and have quickly gotten addicted to always-on Internet connectivity.  Sound quality doesn't change between wifi and 3G and I can't even tell when the phone switches as I get out of range of my configured wifi hotspots.  There is something to be said for the Verizon 3G network coverage.  I live in Phoenix and haven't had any connectivity issues.<br /><br />I do need to mention there's a current issue in the app that shows you 3G signal strength in the phone status bar. It doesn't seem to show true signal strength.  That is at times it has shown zero signal strength and I've made calls, surfed, listened to Internet radio with no quality issues.  Once again, this is a new phone and nothing an update (they download via the 3G / wifi network, by the way - you don't have to plug it into your computer or take it to the Verizon store) won't correct.<br /><br />Voice recognition is pretty flawless (actually performed by the Verizon server farm, I believe) and can be used pretty much anywhere you can use the onscreen keyboard.<br /><br />Integration with Gmail email, contacts & calendar is seamless.  In fact if you have a Gmail account you'll see there's no longer any need to keep contacts on your phone.  You can assign ringtones, notes, etc to your Gmail contacts exactly as you can to contacts stored locally on the phone so why bother backing up with Backup Assistant, etc?  Every time the phone syncs with your Gmail account any changes are "backed up".  You do have the option to sync with other email providers but I haven't explored that feature since I only use Gmail.<br /><br />I've had hit and miss success with Flash video on sites like [...].  But at least the Android OS is committed to supporting Flash so I have full confidence that this will be corrected in an upcoming update.<br /><br />All this chatter about the Apple store having hundreds of thousands of apps vs Google store only having twenty thousand or so seems rather irrelevant to me.  That is, I'm finding PLENTY of apps available and a surprising quantity of great quality FREE apps.  And as the Android OS gets more and more popular, and as Apple gets more and more unfriendly toward their "loyal" developers, there are going to be more and more apps available for the Android OS.<br /><br />Finally, at least in my case Verizon only shipped the anemic printed "Quick Start" guide which did little more than tell you to charge it fully first and gave a quick overview of the phone and setting up Gmail, Facebook, etc.  If you do a Google search for "Droid Incredible Users Guide" you'll find a great 206 page PDF of the full users guide.  I'm not sure why Verizon isn't shipping it (printed OR CD) though it has their logo on it.  If you're new to smartphones and/or the Android OS (like I was) this guide is a must and can help you make the most out of this incredible (ha!) little device.<br /><br />If you're still a fence sitter like I was, yes, there will always be a better phone "coming".  But if you're ready to finally join the smartphone crowd I think the Droid Incredible is an excellent phone to make the leap with.<br />

HTC Incredible compares well to Nexus One
Some of you might be wondering what is the difference between the HTC Incredible (Verizon) and  Nexus One (T-mobile) other than the obvious difference in the mobile phone carriers network.  I just bought my HTC Incredible from the Verizon store and will try to explain the differences and similarities (My friend has the Nexus One).<br /><br />*	Side-by-side, both color saturation, clarity and contrast are great on both HTC smartphones since they are equipped the same excellent 3.7-inch AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display with a native resolution of 480x800.  If I have to pick a winner, I believe the Incredible is slightly better, probably because it is brand new and free of fingerprints and dust.<br /><br />*	The Incredible uses optical trackpad for navigation, whereas the Nexus One uses the trackball (like the older Blackberrys).  The trackpad on the Incredible seems to be more responsive and can scroll quicker, however, I have to say the trackball on the Nexus One seems to be more precise and easier to control while not overshooting the target.  But I think I can master the trackpad with a bit more practice and getting used to how much pressure to use to control it precisely.<br /><br />*	The Nexus One and Incredible both have 4 capacitive buttons for Home, Menu, Search and Back below the screen.  Both devices' buttons are very sensitive to touch, no difference here.<br /><br />*	The Nexus One has 5MP cameras with a single LED flash, whereas the Incredible has a better 8MP sensor with dual-LED flash.  Both cameras have auto-focus.<br /><br />*	In terms of raw processing speed, both smartphones run on a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, which is the state-of-art and both phones can open/close and switch between apps quickly without any noticeable delay.<br /><br />*	For system memory, the Nexus One has 512MB of RAM while the Incredible has 64MB more (total of 576MB). Another hardware difference is the Nexus One has a unique dual mic system for ambient noise cancellation. This feature is unique to the Nexus one and is not available on the Incredible.  I am not sure how effective it really is, but I use my Plantronics 975 Bluetooth headset with arguable the best noise cancellation system so it is not a big deal for me.<br /><br />*	You will notice the UI software is different when you turn the phones on,. The Nexus One uses the standard Android 2.1 OS (Eclair) home page UI, whereas the Incredible and Desire run the proprietary HTC Sense UI .  I really like the Sense Inteface better than the basic Android 2.1 standard UI.  It is more than skin-deep; it replaced and refined much of the standard (boring) interface for most of the Android operating system experience. There are more usable space on the home screen, better media apps and a sleeker number dialer.  The visual appearance is amazing (Incredible!).  It is very attractive and stunning and best of all, none of the eye-candies seemed to affect or slow down the performance of the Incredible when comparing with the Nexus One.<br /><br />*	Yes, the Nexus One does have an advantage due to the T-Mobile 3G network, which is you can use voice and data at the same time.  Being on the Verizon network, the HTC Incredible can't.  Is it a big deal?  I think only you can answer that question, but for me, I can honestly say I can't remember a time why I would really need/use this `feature'.  I have Pandora and it stopped streaming when I am on a call, but I don't want to listen to my music anyway when I am on a call.  And if I have to look up something why I am taking to someone, I can always call them back.  I guess if I am using the Android Google Maps Navigation while talking, I might have a problem, but my car has built-in navigation so it is not an issue for me.<br /><br />Since I just got my Incredible today, I can't comment on battery life or reliability, but since HTC already made similar phones (Nexus One, HTC Desire, etc.)  I believe battery life shouldn't be an issue.  So far the call quality over my Plantronics 975 bluetooth headset is great and no drop call when I was driving to work for an hour on the phone.  I will append my reviews in a few months if I discover any significant issues.  For now, I am very happy with my HTC Incredible.<br />

Without doubt better than iPhone
I took a leap of faith when I replaced my iPhone with the HTC Droid but I have to say that I have fallen in love with this new and Incredible device. The reason I decided to change was because all the specifications beat the iPhone. The HTC Droid has a larger screen, more pixels, a lot better camera with built in flash, faster processor, voice recognition, multitasking, and much more...and with Google as the designer of this operation system I felt my leap was a safe leap. Verizon is another huge draw to switch because they have a faster and more reliable network than at&t and you notice it when you surf the web. The only category where the iPhone beats the HTC Droid is the number of applications, but the great majority of apps are useless anyway so the difference in number of apps means nothing. I have found as many fun and useful apps on the HTC that I did on the iPhone. If you like to customize your phone you'll find the HTC refreshing to use. You can replace pretty much any part of the phone from your web browser to your texting application to your email program. You are not locked in to the software that was shipped with the phone (like Apple who controls every aspect of your phone). Another part of the HTC Droid that I like a lot is that everything you do online from Facebooking to Twitterin to gmailing is suddenly integrated elegantly on your phone. In your address book you can chose between texting your friend or writing on their Facebook wall or show a Google map of their house. When you take a photo you can instantly and easily share it in various ways (Facebook, gmail, flickr, text). Another big plus that I can think of is the volume on the speaker. I could never hear my iPhone ring (unless I used the most obnoxious ring signal) and watching youTube videos often involved having to put the iPhone next to my ear to hear, but the HTC has a real good and loud speaker which you can easily hear. No more missed calls. If you like Google and realize what an amazing company they are you will know how amazing their phone is. Do I have to say I highly recommend this phone??

Out of the way, iPhone!
The HTC Droid Incredible is ambitiously named, but lives up to the expectations. The screen is absolutely amazing. It's bright, saturated, and looks absolutely beautiful. It responds very well to touch, and is big enough to display webpages, apps, and most importantly to me, Google Maps.<br /><br />The excellent screen, paired with the 1GHz SnapDragon processor creates a fast, colorful experience that can't be matched by the current generation of iPhones or BlackBerries. Navigation is smooth and seamless, even while running Pandora in the background and reading the news in a browser or looking for apps in the Android Market.<br /><br />The GPS is quick to lock on, much faster than the BlackBerry Bold I previously used. Google Maps works beautifully with this phone; the amazing screen and fast processor really shine. The navigation feature in the newest version of Google Maps works wonders despite being a beta version.<br /><br />This phone sets the bar high and easily out-performs the current aging generation of iPhones. The Android market is growing at a rapid pace, and the Android OS is superior in many ways to the iPhone OS. Even so, the real stars of the show are the screen and CPU. This is the first phone I've used that can replace a laptop for basic functionality.

Google Navigation Response
This is in response to the fellow who said that because the phone can't be on data 3g at the same time as making a call that it might cause a problem if he was talking on his phone while using navigation.<br /><br />In reality you can use google navigation at the same time as making a call, its not an issue what-so-ever. What happens is google navigation runs in the background and has preloaded the maps it needs onto the built in storage or sd card. You will still hear the voice navigation when talking on the phone so you won't miss any turns but it does not prevent you from making a call as suggested. In fact it works very seemlessly and performs well. Once you hang up the phone it goes right back to navigation and never misses a beat. Its one of the nice features they built into google navigation and one of the reasons this phone (or any android phone running os 1.6 and above) and the android platform are worth their weight in gold.<br /><br />I have since sold my tomtom navigation unit and that in itself has paid for the price of the phone. The incredible is an amazing device and i would not hesitate for a minute to buy it again. Before this phone i had an eris and while that was nice it was just not quite enough for my needs. The incredible fills the void completely and offers me so much more. I rate this phone a perfect 100/100, i could not have designed it any better myself and there is not 1 thing about this phone i don't love.

The Name Is Perfect For This Smartphone
I have tried a number of different smartphones and was actually planning on holding out for an Android 2.1 phone with a large screen, fast processor, and a qwerty keyboard.  But when I tried this phone out at the Verizon store, I was sold.  I have used the iPhone onscreen keyboard and I actually feel that the Incredible keyboard works better.  I can actually type about 20wpm using the Incredible onscreen keyboard.  I do not know if it is just the way I type, but I get more typos when I try to type at the same speed using the iPhone keyboard.  <br /><br />I thought the topography style back plate would be weird, but I actually like it a lot.  It not only gives you a better grip when holding the phone, but it is actually well implemented.  The build quality is excellent, with no loose parts or squeaky components.  The display is bright and crisp, and I have not yet seen the phone stutter because of lack of processing power.  <br /><br />Apps are plentiful.  It is true that Android Market currently has 50k apps versus the iPhone App Store's 190k apps, but I believe it is more like 30k versus 60k, as many, many apps are completely useless, redundant, or both.  It has all of the apps I need along with some amazing Google apps.  Android Market is also growing exponentially with the widespread adoption of Android.  The Incredible also has widgets which the iPhone does not have.  A calendar widget allows you to see what is on your agenda on the home screen with having to launch any calendar app.  The built in FM tuner is nice.<br /><br />This smartphone is also highly customizable.  You can change widget placement, widget sizes, app placement, active wallpapers, and your Incredible can look different from other Incredibles.  However, because of its customizability, it is a little more complicated than the iPhone.  More options and features necessarily entails slightly more complexity, but the Incredible is still amazingly intuitive.  I have not yet needed to reference the instruction manual a single time, and I have used the smartphone extensively for about a week.  <br /><br />I have separate mailboxes for Gmail, Exchange, and Yahoo Mail.  The contacts and calendar synched from my Google and Facebook accounts surprisingly perfectly. They helped me set mine up in store and installed the free 2GB memory card.  I actually purchased mine the afternoon of the release date.  The store had 45 at the beginning of the day, and they had 2 left when I got mine.  The store manager said that the first three people waiting in line for the Incredible when the store opened were iPhone users who decided to switch.     <br /><br />The Incredible allows Flash, giving you the option of viewing Flash content if you like.  The iPhone does not even give you the option of using Flash because Steve Jobs does not like Adobe and Flash.  The Incredible also allows you to download apps from Android market or other sources.  Not only does Apple restrict you to downloading apps only from Apple's app store, Apple censors the apps in the app store based on some opaque and whimsical criteria.  Apple recently censored an app from a journalist who was critical of Steve Jobs.  In my opinion, Steve Jobs is becoming too powerful and is showing his inner Big Brother.  Sure the iPhone is double plus good, but this Droid is Incredible.

Replaced my iPhone and love it.No more Apple dictatorship
I replaced my 3G iPhone, as I had terrible signal with AT&T and was stuck on the slow edge network most of the time. Since switching to Verizon, I get 3G everywhere and I can customize my phone without going through the trouble of jailbreaking the phone. I use Google for almost everything so it integrates perfect. I love Google voice.  The customizations are almost endless, the first couple days I felt like I was chained to my phone as I couldn't put it down. My only disappointment is battery life but that can be fixed with additional batteries or an extended life one. Since switching I haven't missed my iPhone once, finally a serious contender to the Pompous dictator Apple.

A Nice Piece of Hardware for Android!
I am on my 3rd Android phone: T-Mobile G1, Motorola Droid and now the HTC Incredible.  The OS has progressed in usability much since it's initial 1.0 version and the current 2.1 with Sense UI add-ons makes the experience much more enjoyable.<br /><br />The phone is fast and the Verizon 3G network is fast.  Web browsing is great and the phone has native GMail support as well as Exchange support.  It has an 8MP camera that takes decent pictures (save for the flash is over kill in low-light and up close) and comes with 8GB of memory that can be supplemented with a MicroSD card (it comes with a 2GB, but that is pretty useless- get at least a 16GB)<br /><br />There are about 50,000 apps at present, but this number is growing every day.  Most notable is a Google Voice application which is the only way to use voice mail.  The included Google Maps has 3D Google navigation.  The other Google apps are all present and work as they should on a Google OS (Earth, Shopping, Tracks, etc).<br /><br />There are rumors of upcoming desktop and car docks (later for GPS) and an extended battery- but these have not appeared on Verizon's site as of yet.  The 'glossy silicone' phone case from Verizon is excellent for $15- and looks pretty nice with the diamond patterns on the back.<br /><br />The phone is not without issues; there are battery life issues (mostly when the phone gets into a 3G/1x EVDO area and keeps switching) and the optical trackpad can be a little wonky at times.  <br /> <br />To get into some of the really neat features, you will need to do some 'under the hood' work.  For example: If you want the alarm clock to wake to a particular MP3, you need to put the track in the SD Card under /media/audio/alarms.   If you want to use an MP3 as a ringtone, same as the alarm, but the MP3 needs to go under /media/audio/ringtones.<br /><br />I use both an iPhone 3GS (for work) and the HTC Incredible. The iPhone I use for playing games (Space Miner, PvZ, etc) as the game developers aren't all on board with Android yet; I use the Incredible for everything else: Phone calls, photos, music, email, web browsing, texting, facebook, webcam viewer, etc.  <br /><br />In closing, if you are looking for a phone to play games, buy a cheap phone and get a Nintendo DSi or a Sony PSP- or as a last resort an iPhone will work.  If you are looking for a great phone that has tons of useful features that can replace 90% of what most people use a laptop for, get the HTC Incredible!

Absolutely awesome! It has replaced my desktop for the internet and it has facilitated business!
I have owned the Incredible since the day that it was released, April 29, 2010. I was unhappy at first, because I had to pay $30 extra a month and the phone was initially very hard for me to get used to using. However, after the first day or two, I learned how to use the phone and I now greatly appreciate it when I am on the road. I have always used my Mac Pro for not only my photography business' photoshop, etc, but also for internet and scheduling. Now, I use the Incredible for almost everything on the internet and I can access the internet when I am on the road. So, when I have a client calling me, I can do research if I have to and I can check my schedule without having to call my secretary. Any updates that I make or my secretary makes to my schedule are almost immediately synchronized with my Gmail calendar on the phone and any other device that has access to the calendar. This is possibly my most favorite feature!<br /><br />My only ongoing complaint with the phone is its dreadful battery life. This is due a lot to how often I use the phone; it is never in standby for more than 30 minutes and I usually am using it every 15 minutes or so for something. Anyone buying this phone will probably be using it as much as I am or close thereto. I go through three batteries a day on average! I have to keep it plugged in continuously. Batteries are $60 for this phone, on Amazon! That is the extended battery, though. It is about 35% more powerful. Furthermore, I find it frustrating that there are only a handful of accessories available for this phone right now. But, these are all little trifles compared to the big picture: this phone is absolutely amazing and perfect in almost every way. I recommend this phone to every businessman or anyone in need of internet on a regular basis. Do NOT be deterred by its lack of battery life, etc. Its benefits FAR outweigh its drawbacks!!<br /><br />P.s. I found an 1100 mAh battery for the HTC Eris that should work fine with the Incredible. It is only 1100 mAh, but it is also only $9!! I have ordered one already, I recommend looking at it. If it works for me, I will order three more of the batteries! HTC Eris uses the same battery that the Incredible does. The extended battery is not the same, though (I mean the EXTERNAL extended battery)!

Love this Phone!
There are a few flaws with the phone right now concerning battery life, but they all have work arounds...<br />-Battery Life: there is a glitch with charging the phone to full capacity. But there is a work around. Once it's fully charge (green light), turn phone off(you will get red light), plug-in while off until light turns green again.<br />-HTC Calendar app: will keep phone awake not letting it sleep, draining battery. Solution: Kill the calendar app with task killer when phone first turns on. Then you will be ok to leave it running afterward.<br />-Flickr Sync: is known to drain the battery (not let it sleep). Remove flickr sync from the Accounts and Sync setting menu, and this will solve the problem.<br />-I also had very bad call quality that would kind of come and go with each call. it sounded like there was an over active noise gate on the calls. I did a "hard reset" aka factory reset and this solved the problem, and also seemed to help with battery issues. I would recommend that you do a full factory reset yourself before you start customizing and download any apps.<br /><br />I have yet to scratch this screen, but i baby it.<br /><br />There is only one piece of crap-ware that is uninstallable: City ID. Not a big deal, doesn't get in the way or drain resources. Boo on Verizon for squeezing this in.<br /><br />HTC sense is nice. I find the giant clock to be silly, but you can remove that. It's a widget.<br /><br />Definitely look into Google Voice, best addition of any android phone.

Works for me!
I like it quite a bit. Much snazzier than my roommates iPhones and I've almost got both of them interested in getting one once their contracts with ATT are up. Nothing beats listening to Pandora in the car with Google turn-by-turn navigation making sure I don't get lost. GPS + cardio apps make running actually a fun thing. Multi-tasking, backgrounds, not locked into proprietary Apple crap like iTunes, Skype mobile so I can talk to my friends in Spain while I'm not near a computer... While there are some really good apps that the iPhone has that Android doesn't yet have, the Incredible has functionality that the iPhone does not.

Great Phone!  Bring a charger!
I have held off on buying a Smartphone for Verizon wireless for a few years now.  They just didn't have anything close to the iPhone.  There were a lot of "wannabes"; even the LG Dare was once thought to be the next iPhone killer, ha-ha.  <br />Having said that, I think the HTC Droid Incredible is the best smart phone you can buy for Verizon.  <br />The Droid Incredible is very advanced and does amazing things.  For instance, it can scan barcodes and turn a taken photo of a business card into a contact.  Also, it has Google maps, which I can't wait to use.  Live backgrounds are amazing as well. This is a very nice alternative to the iPhone and I'm happy I got it.  <br />I use to hate the keyboard and it was also confusing getting all the settings adjusted to my specifications. Fortunately now I have adjusted to be okay with the keyboard.  Also, I fixed all the settings to my liking. <br />This phone is 'finicky' sometimes.  Today, for instance, the buttons were pressing on there own.  I had to take out the battery in order for it to stop, as powering it down didn't work.  It also didn't get reception in the back of a department store I was in, something I never noticed on my previous phone.(lg dare)<br />

Yet ANOTHER Good Review
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HC8NUW">HTC DROID INCREDIBLE Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)</a><br /><br />OK, my original plan was to not get sucked in to another contract and possibly look into something Tracfone has going with Walmart that uses Verizon's network anyhow. Then I saw the Nexus 1 and heard it was coming to Verizon. Well we now know that is a pipe dream. So I start hearing a lot about this HTC Incredible that Verizon will offer instead of the Nexus 1. <br /><br />So here we are and here I am with an Incredible. I am upgrading from an LG Voyager which still works great but I wanted a true smartphone for a long time and 2 years ago the LG served my needs well.<br /><br />Obviously there is a bit of a learning curve but not too steep. Since there are plenty of reviews that give specs and features I shall focus upon what is best/worst in my circumstances.<br /><br />I am use to a flip open keyboard and there is none with this phone but I see once I adjust to it the on-screen will not be so bad. One feature that is a HUGE plus for me is the ability to voice dictate text messages. If you speak clearly it does very well. I am in the earlier stages of what may become a crippling arthritic condition and I find people text a lot more than talk anymore. Being able to speak and have the phone type it be it a text message or email was the push that sent me to ordering one.<br /><br />Since I have read so much about short battery life and I do see that myself I am getting a higher capacity one. This phone does play some flash content but not all. Zips around the net at a decent speed and is very responsive to the touch commands.<br /><br />My only huge frustration thus far was trying to add a ringtone from a text attachment. I come to learn you can not add them that way, you save them out then add them where as the LG would add as ringtone without saving the attachment first, like I said small learning curve.<br /><br />I am not thrilled how you access the battery and the SD slot either, you must PRY the back off. Is not like you need a crowbar and I understand is not expected that you would be in there much but it kinda cheapens an awesome design.<br /><br />Something interesting I accidently discovered, with my LG I use to charge it mostly USB through my Dell 1545 since it was simple and freed up a plug. Well, I use to rest the phone on the wrist rest on the right side since I use a USB keyboard. I expected I could do the same with the incredible, not happening. First time I thought it was the computer, but quickly found it was the phone. When placing this phone in the exact same place as I had the LG........it KILLS the video card! I mean instant blackout! First time it came back on after about a minute, next time required a reboot. So if you experience any blackouts and your phone is close or on your computer is something to check.<br /><br />Everything else is pretty much what everyone is saying, nothing is perfect but this phone is pretty sweet. Long way from when I got my first cell, a Moto V120. Can't wait to see how they get me to bite the hook again two years from now lol.

LOVE this phone
I've been waiting for this phone for quite a while. The Nexus One was too annoying to buy through Google and the Moto Droid was just too clunky. This is a beautiful piece of machinery. Touchscreen is wonderful and extremely fast (love the 1GHz processor). The battery life is so-so but I guess you have to expect that from a mini computer...downloaded some power saving apps like Sceebl and that helps some. I'm buying the extended battery from Seidio and will update later on that. Some reviews on tech sites mention that it feels "plasticy" or cheap...which I don't really agree with. I think the fact that it's more lightweight than others says a lot about how awesome it is. The touchscreen keyboard is quite easy to use (had a bit of a learning curve for a day or so, but now less than a week later I'm great at it). It's kind of annoying that some apps automatically start (like footprints). The camera is very nice considering how small the lens is. I really wish there was some kind of cover for the lens so it wouldn't be so easy to scratch it, but I cut a circle out of some screen protector material and put it over the lens. Doesn't effect my picture quality at all as far as I can tell. I've never owned a smartphone, so my opinion may be biased...but it's everything I could ever want and more with only a few minor complaints. &lt;3

incredible indeed
I preordered this phone from verizon and got it on Apr 29th. I really liked it. <br /><br />Pros: <br />1. super fast. I can ran many (more than 10) apps and switch between them with no gap. <br />2. HTC sense is a very nice interface to integrate my google/facebook account (I don't have twitter, but I believe it would work seamlessly as well), so I could have all my contacts in one place with their phone numbers/emails/facebook accounts.<br />3. It is highly customizable (in a way much better than the iDon't). You can set up different profiles (background, volume, vibration, notification) for work, for home or anything else, and specify a switch time. So it would switch to vibrate and shut down wifi automatically when you go to work for example, and switch back and turn on wifi by the time you get home.<br />4. Big and beautiful screen. <br /><br />Cons:<br />1. apps. I got almost everything I need. But I would hope to get more games like the titles iPhone got (e.g. plants vs zombies). Well, I think as the android momentum starts to build, more developers would be willing to write apps for android.<br />2. battery. that's the first biggest problem I notice. I guess since it runs at super power, it also consumes a lot of energy. I have to plug it with the charger right after I get home everyday. I am always very concerned about shutdown if I have used it heavily during the day. There is an app (something called "advanced task killer") that kills apps running on the background unnoticed. That will save you some battery. But it doesn't solve the problem completely. Innocell is selling a 1750mAh extended life battery. I am going to try that.<br />

Great Phone
Phone is awesome. Display is good, calling is good. The battery life is pretty standard for smart phones. Mine lasts the whole day and I use a lot of internet and other applications. Good news is if the battery life isn't what you want you can get a bigger battery from seidio but I haven't decided to do that yet. The thing I like best about the phone is the voice recognition. I spoke a whole email and didn't have type one word, I thought that was pretty awesome. You can use the voice recognition in almost all the areas were you can input text.

BEST FM TRANSMITTER I HAVE EVER OWNED
I don't usually write reviews, but I was so pleased with this product that I had to do it. I have owned several FM transmitters (Griffin, Belkin) and always found them to be very annoying with having to change channels constantly. With this one I drove all the way across New York State and never changed the channel once. There was very little hissing and interference. Moreover, the holder is very handy and adjusts to many different sized ipods. I have a Touch, I didn't try it on other kinds. Great product! (Even has a remote, which I will probably lose, but it's still nifty)

Great Product
I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this product at first. I examined many of the IPOD car kits and many of them had terrible reviews.  This was the one that had the least complaints, was one of the cheapest...so therefore, I purchased it.  I am completely satisfied with this product.  It works wonderfully.  The music from my IPOD sounds just as if I was playing a CD in my car. You just have to find a radio station that picks up well enough, which for me only took 2 tries.  I think its an excellent product and would definitely recommend it to anyone searching for an IPOD car kit...take it from someone that did tons of research, read many reviews, and is price conscientious.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Excellent Product Even If You Live Near a City
Let me begin by saying that FM transmitter should only be bought if you don't have a AUX port or don't want to fiddle around with cassette adapters.<br /><br />Now with that little bit out of the way, I can say that from my initial tests this mounting Kit and FM Transmitter work beautifully. I have an iPod Classic and the kit comes with adjustable sides, allowing it to fit all iPods. The sound quality is good, and the kit charges the iPod. All-in-all it is definitely worth the money I have only three minor complaints about the kit. (The transmitter is covered below)<br /><br />1. The Kit shakes a small amount when you drive due to the vibration of the engine (I drive a 2001 CR-V). I drove for around 30 minutes on variety of roads (highway like, rougher roads) and it didn't fall out, nor did the iPod move out of the container, but it is something of note <br /><br />2. I have an incase leather protector around my iPod, which unfortunately cannot be mounted with the iPod. Not a big deal, as I have a place to put the case while I'm driving, but could be a problem for some who love their cases<br /><br />3. Depending on the placement of your cigarette lighter the screen can be harder to see. I can still see mine clearly from where I am, but there is no extension cord to move it to a better part of the car. Also, I have the gearshift near my steering wheel. If your gearshift is on the floor, problems could arise when you are putting the car into park. Like most mounting kits, you must prepare a playlist ahead of time. The remote (yes it works) is nice to skip tracks, but unless you are stopped, it is unsafe to change a playlist while you are driving.<br /><br />All of these complaints I repeat are minor in the end.<br /><br />Now how is the sound? I live in Northbrook, IL which is 20 minutes out of downtown Chicago; however I get all of the local suburban radio stations as well as the city stations. Despite all of the radio stations I am still able to find frequencies that work for this. Many people don't know how to use FM transmitters which can explain why some get poor reviews. You need not only a clear station, but have at least the station before and after (preferably two if it exists) also open so there is as little competition as possible.<br /><br />The sound quality is good, you can listen to your music and hear everything fine. If you are someone who stresses top-notch sound, then go buy an AUX kit for your car, b/c that'll give you the best. But if you are just looking for an alternative besides the terrible radio, this kit will get the job done. One thing as of note is that it is difficult while driving to change the frequency on the radio should you encounter static. Another is that your iPod will not automatically pause once the car is turned off. Many complain about the latter, but I don't see this as a big deal, because you should be taking your iPod with you out of your car you can just turn it off then. (Leaving your iPod in a kit is just asking for your windows to be smashed in)<br /><br />There certainly are some flashier kits and FM Transmitters that will autoscan and some have presets you can use in case you ever have to switch. But for a price tag slightly under 30 bucks, you won't find a better deal.

EXCELLENT PRODUCT, EXCELLENT VALUE
I was a little skeptical about the first review on this product, which seemed a bit over the top, but after receiving this product and trying it out, I'm going to have to agree: this is THE BEST FM TRANSMITTER FOR IPODS I HAVE EVER OWNED.<br /><br />I owned one made by Griffin for my iPod nano and it was decent, but there was only one channel (87.9) that worked where I live (15 minutes from downtown Minneapolis) and there was quite a bit of static sometimes.  When I received an iPod Touch for my birthday I went to Best Buy and paid $55 for another Griffin product and it was AWFUL.  There wasn't a single station that didn't have a lot of static and it just seemed very poorly made.<br /><br />I then found this online for half the price, and the sound quality is excellent.  It honestly sounds as good as a CD on several channels in throughout the city.  The packaging concerned me at first, as there are several misprints which made we wonder if as little care went into the product as went into the packaging, but after several days of using this I couldn't be more pleased.  My one concern is that the plastic that the holder is made of seems a little cheap and I'm concerned that it might break if I change it from one car to the other too often.  At this price, though, you can buy two of them for the price of one terrible Griffin product!<br /><br />One other minor complaint: the photo here shows that it is black, but the one I received was white.  I would have sent it back and requested a black one to go with my Touch, but I really don't care and I've been so pleased with it that it seemed like a pretty minor thing.  <br /><br />BARGAINCELL: If you want to send me the right color, I'd be happy to edit my review to reflect that you did!

Works great, once you figure it out...
Like a lot of the other reviewers, part of the problem with this device is that it comes with absolutely no instructions. The device itself isn't hard to figure out, it's pretty straight forward... but there was one aspect of it that might have led to some of the bad reviews about this product:<br /><br />- It has both a iPod/iPhone connector and a 3.5mm audio connector. My first impression was to plug both in together; the Audio connector for, well, audio... and the iPod connector to charge it and enable the remote control use.<br /><br />When both connectors are connected, the audio quality is HORRIBLE... there is a loud high pitched hum, lots of static and the slightest movement of the device seemed to completely cut out the audio...<br /><br />Upset by this, I started to take my iPod Touch out of the cradle, and the first thing I disconnected was the 3.5mm audio connector and I paused for a moment as the audio continued to play and in PERFECT quality...<br /><br />So at this moment, I realized the iPod connector is an all-in-one connector... charges, enables the remote control use, and outputs audio to the cradle. Using only the iPod connector, the audio quality is superb and there is absolutely no static or humming at all.<br /><br />So if you have this product and you are experiencing a hum or static or just poor audio quality; try disconnecting the 3.5mm audio connector and just using the iPod connector.

No instructions--turn up the volume under EQ
This is a great product once you figure out how to use it, since there are no instructions.  NOTE!!: you must turn up the main volume under settings/EQ on your iPod in order for the signal to be strong enough to hear on your radio.  I fiddled for 4 days thinking I'd bought a lemon because I had to turn my radio all the way up.  Once you do that it works a charm, I love it!!

AWESOME PRODUCT! Strongly urge you to buy it + great customer service.
I never ever write reviews like the person before me, but this one I had to!<br />This product is fantastic. You can change the size and angle to best fit your desires, and your specific Ipod. The holder is great and allows you to easily read the Ipod screen. The sound is very clear, only sometimes do I hear static, and somehow I found that keeping my Ipod backlight "always on" makes the static go away, but may be that was just a defect with my unit. Also, You can set it just about ANY radio station. It is easy to switch stations - there are buttons on the top that allow you to easily change the station. When you pick a station the next time you power the unit on (when your car turns on it automatically turns on as it gets power from the car through the cigarrete lighter)it plays from that station. So you dont have to change stations each time it turns on.<br /><br />A few minor things to consider. The remote is nice. However, it is not very convinient as you have to hold it quite close to the product. Not a good mix while driving, but may be that was also a defect with my unit. Another thing to note is that this is not wireless so it goes directly into your cigarette lighter which may cause it to be in an uncomfortable location (this allows it to charge at the same time). But even if its is in an awkward position you can turn it so it points in any direction you want. So really nothing big that you cant handle easily.<br /><br />Lastly, the customer service is awesome. They are prompt, professional, and courteous. Very helpful!<br /><br />So overall - I would strongly recommend this to anyone, and I already have.<br /><br />P.S.- Though it may seem like it - I promise I dont work for this company! <br />

Excellent FM Transmitter
I have spent three times the amount on other transmitters that do not come close to the no clear, no loss of volume power, that this beauty delivers.  I drive truck for a living and have no IPOD Aux Port, this has made my once boring radio tiresome days NO MORE!  All the functions deliver, price could be more, honestly!

Bought this for my daughter, works well but you have to beware where your cigarette lighter is located or the fit could be clumsy. She is satisfied with it and it was shipped quite quickly.

Best Darn FM Transmitter
Well i bought this Trans for [...] and guess what! its really good. Yeah the quality made isn't the best, but the price and sound quality is. When you get it, don't use the usb cable and little cable because it will sound in only one side. Just use the USB and Viola il marche tres bien. Totally Good Buy.

Use it all the time...
The last time I tried a device like this, I couldn't get it to work.  I didn't have much faith in products that transmit an FM signal to my radio, but this product works like a charm.  I use it with an iPod Touch, along with an app that tells me the best empty FM frequencies in my area by zip code.  Once I found the right frequency, the device works amazingly well.  It does drop out of sync for a few seconds sometimes, but that's a minor occurrence that doesn't present a problem for me.  Much will depend on the location of your cigarette lighter or power source, since it may block some controls on your dash, but, again, it's a minor problem considering the great music I can now hear while driving.  You can't beat the price.

Works great
We wanted to use this with a Nano and chose this adapter because it looked like it would adjust to the slimmer width. It does! And we have no complaints. It works as advertised.

Excellent router with no problems whatsoever
This is an exceptional router and at this price you can't find a better choice. I see a lot of disgruntled people here who can't connect to the router wirelessly after changing settings. I would like to give a couple of tips. First of all, make sure you configure the router when you are hard wired. You have to ensure that you are connected to the router via a LAN cable whenever you are making any changes to the router's configuration. This way when the router restarts etc. you will still be connected to it. If you are carrying out any changes to the router through your wireless card, for example if you have changed the WEP encryption code in the router, then once you submit those changes, the router will not let your wireless card connect until your laptop's card is configured for the same WEP key. So once again, please ensure you carry out changes to the router only when hard wired. The moment you get your router, I suggest you carry out a firmware upgrade (go to netgear's support site and download the latest firmware for your model from there). Once again follow instructions and make sure you are connected through a cable to carry out the same. Now log onto the router and then do a couple of things. <br /><br />First of all, rename the SSID to anything you want (eg. Joan's Arc). Then go to the wireless settings, then to wireless access, and click on 'Disable SSID broadcast'. This ensures that the SSID is not broadcast to others around you who have a wireless machine. So when their software searches for a wireless access point all they will see is a blank name. To be able to connect to your network they would have to know the name of your SSID (Joan's Arc in this case) and manually type it in their machines (Highly unlikely that they will be able to think of the same name as you do. You can make your name even harder to obtain by simply using numeric characters in it.. for example Joan's Arc2004). Secondly, to make it secure use a 128 bit WEP key (this has to be a 26 digit key consisting of alphanumeric and numeric characters. You can use only certain alphabets in small and large case so you need to check that out. Also remember that you have to feed the same WEP key number in your laptop wireless card software (or the windows wireless settings if you are not using your wireless card's software). Finally you can ensure that only the wireless devices you specify can logon to your router. Go to the Wireless settings, then to wireless access setup and then click on 'enable wireless access'... Thereafter click on 'Setup access list'. Once there add your wireless device by using its mac address (the mac address is a unique number given to a wireless device, very much like a phone number- this enables the router to identify the device trying to connect to it). The mac address will be listed on your wireless device and you can also see all the devices that you can allow to connect to your router in the router's configuration window. (One important note to remember is that if you have already enabled WEP then you will have to first feed in the same key into your wireless device software settings before the router will display it in it's list of devices). Select the device that you want to allow to connect to your router and apply.<br /><br />Hope this helps to a certain extent to configure your routers. Trust me, this is an amazing router and if you are having connection problems, it most likely is due to the settings in the router- not because the router is faulty.

Easy to install.  Works great.  Looks great!
EASY TO INSTALL...  This was my first router installation, but it was easy!  The router comes with short, easy-to-follow installation directions.  It took me 10-minutes to open the box, read the directions, connect the hardware (it includes a power cord and a network cable), power-up my PC, boot into Windows XP and access the router through Internet Explorer.  Netgear's interface is wonderful.  Modifying security settings, an optional step, was a breeze.  I never even looked at the CD that was included.<p>WORKS GREAT...  As soon as my desktop PC booted into Windows XP, I was connected to the Internet through my Road Runner cable connection (my PC was connected to the router via cable; the router, of course, was connected to the cable modem).  Laptop connection was almost as easy.  I did download the most recent firmware (1102) from Netgear's web site to make the router 100% compatible with the 802.11g specs and to be able to block broadcast of SSID (the upgrade also fixed some minor problems):  http://www.netgear.com/support/support_dnld.asp?prodNum=WGR614<p>LOOKS GREAT...  The picture doesn't do it justice, nor will anything I can say.  I have the router sitting vertically in its stand.  The side LEDs face me.  They are clearly marked, lit (or blinking) icons.  Thin and elegant.<p>I was torn between Linksys and Netgear.  I still respect Linksys, but I am glad that I bought Netgear.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Outstanding
I was torn between this and the Linksys WRT54G. I read some of the reviews and the Linksys seemed unstable and had a lot of complaints (having to download a patch wasn't in my agenda). Also, the linksys seemed too big and bulky. I was going to go for the Link because I thought bigger was better and since it was more expensive, would perform better.<p>I finally settled for this and the Netgear WG511 Wireless 54g PC Card because it was cheaper and had lesser complaints. Plus, it was a lot smaller.<p>Installation with WinME was a breeze and I couldn't be happier. (Took no more than 15 minutes) I thought it was going to be a hassle but it wasn't. I think having optimum online was part of it (no need to configure ISPs and domain names). The bulk of the 15 mins was the restart and plugging all the cables in. <p>The range for my laptop is excellent. 78% signal strength and the wireless router base is upstairs (I'm in the basement) and two rooms to the right. <p>Now I can surf anywhere in the house!<p>Oh, and here's the kicker... you know how big and bulky that linksys looks? This one has a stand so you can stand it up. If I had seen that, I would've bought this the first day that I had looked at it. <p>First electronic purchase that I didn't regret.

Works great with Mac OS X
I bought this router so that I could make use of my high-speed access (DSL) throughout the house. Set-up and configuration were a snap, although the default configuration is not very secure, and you will definitely want to do things like change the admin password, enable MAC authentication and WPA encryption, and so on. With my Ti Powerbook G4 I get great reception throughout my house (which is old and has thick walls). I also have a first-generation iMac and an old Laserwriter connected to the router by Ethernet, so both computers can reach the internet and I can print wirelessly from the Powerbook. Very nice, and much, much cheaper than Apple's Airport Extreme base station. Highly recommended.

One of the better Routers
I started my quest to set up a wireless network at home with my Dell laptop and a Belkin F5D7230-4 router. The experience was painful and time consuming and ended up with me throwing the Belkin router into trash (Belkin's tech support told me that their routers are incompatible with Intel Centrino chips! I wonder what they are doing in wireless market then).<br />This is when I talked to my friends and almost everybody suggested Linksys or Netgear. A local Fry's store was selling Netgear WGR614 at discounted prices during a sale. I jumped on it. <br />To rate any router, one has to comment on its 3 "S", setup, specs and security. I have done quite a bit of research and below is my report on these.<br /><br />SETUP: Took me less than 5 minutes to complete the setup. Only thing I had to do was to connect all the cables and turn the power on. Then choose a SSID, password, provide your connection information (depending upon what type of internet connection you have) and voila! I had a wireless network up and running.<br /><br />SPECIFICATIONS: It supports both 108.11b and g networking. Weighs  about half a lb. and is small (7"x1"x4.5") Mine is silver and looks so cool that I don't mind putting it on my tv! <br /><br />SECURITY: Netgear router not only provides wireless network for your home but also protects it. It has a strong firewall to insulate your home machines for malicious hacker attacks like Denial Of Service, or attempts to access your machine from internet. It can also help you manage the content being accessed (if you have kids, this is a great feature). It allows remote management too and you can get the logs emailed to you.<br /><br />I had to do almost no other maintenance in last 6 months that I have owned this router. It has a decent range. I can go to a park across the street and still access my network. <br />For 95% of us, this is enough. <br />I cannot comment on Netgear's customer service since I have never used it and I hope I won't have too!<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe most known brands like Linksys and D-Link may also have some good routers. But you still have to make sure that the one you buy works for your laptop and your home (for example, according to Belkin's customer service their wireless routers are incompatible with Centrino chips.)<br />Netgear has worked great for me and I am sure it will work well for you too. <br />It is being sold for a great price right now, so go and grab yours. You won't be disappointed.

Satellite Internet Wireless Link to Home Computers
I purchased the WGR614 along with a Netgear WG511 54 Mbps wireless PC Card from Amazon. I use it to connect from my High Speed 2-Way DirecWay Satellite connection wirelessly to my Dell 8000 and Dell 8200 laptops, and my old Gateway desktop in my home. I purchased it primarily because I was told that some other 54 Mbps brands did not allow both b and g cards to be accessed at the same time on the same system. I installed the new g card on my 8200 with no problems at all but then when the entire system was up after about an hour I found that when using the g card on either of the laptops the other with a b card would not work. After a great deal of help from tech support we found that there is a conflict between the DirecWay DW6000 and the router. Both are addressed by http://192.168.0.1. We solved this by changing the address code for the router to 10.0.0.1 and BINGO everything was perfect. I highly recommend these products and the NETGEAR tech support system. They are the best money can buy at this time. I also found Amazon's service very good and responsive, and besides, they offered the lowest price (after rebates) I could find on the Web.

Installation and configuration in 5 mins, 54G, good signal
I have both Netgear WG614 router/access point and WG511 notebook adapter. Replaced wired network with wireless in ~ 5 minutes. Setup and configuration process is intuitive and is very easy. Router's web interface contains great context-sensitive help; connection wizard is awesome. This router looks great too. Within 50 metres get 90-95% signal strength, with 54Mbps conection. Buy it!

Rock solid, great range
Having dealt with some of the early generation wireless-B products from Linksys and others, this router was am amazing breath of fresh air.  <p>Flawless installation and a set of wizards to walk you through.  The capability to restrict websites and log what your children are browsing is a big plus.<p>Saving the best for last, the range on this router (combined with the companion wireless G pc card from Netgear) has been nothing short of astounding.  Rooms that before had little to no signal are coming in around 65% signal strength with this router.  I also really liked the driver's ability to scan for networks and then you can simply select yours.<p>Don't hesitate.  Buy this router.

Works great with my Macs
I picked this up to try to use it as an auxilliary sound device for my Macs after my iMic died; I figured that if it didn't work, I wouldn't be out much.  But it works very well; plug it in and it's recognized, without any driver installation.  The out-bound sound quality seems very good.  All in all, you can't beat the performance for the price.

Excellent alternate sound card
I picked this unit up to provide sound and mic for an ear boom headset to take with me in my laptop bag so I can use my Skype line.  I have an acer gemstone that I picked up a year ago at a Walmart doorbuster special, and the built in mic never worked.  I was a little nervous purchasing this product, given the reviews, but the price was right so I gave it a chance.  <br /><br />Wow, what a refreshing surprise this turned out to be!  I plugged in the boom headset, plugged the unit into the USB port of my Ubuntu 8.10 laptop, it showed up automatically in the volume control, adjusted the mixer settings a bit, and it worked perfectly.  The sound going into the mono earpiece was perfect, and everyone I've talked to over my Skype line has said I sound crystal clear, like on a real phone, or at least a decent cell connection.  <br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking to do Skype or voice over IP.  Its always best to have a separate sound system when doing VOIP, as your primary sound typically interferes with your reception.  This is an awesome solution to the second sound card problem, its ultra portable, has perfectly crisp sound with no interference <br /><br />For what I was using it for worked great, but what about music?  I reconfigured the sound server to use the little device to play back music, and wow, amazing sound came out of the headphones!  This unit can more than replace your current sound system.  It even seemed to provide more backbone to the music than the internal HDA sound built into my laptop.<br /><br />So for doing VOIP, or replacing a sound card that just isn't working for you, or providing sound to a machine that lacks it, this little unit is for you.  It works 110% for me on Ubuntu 8.10.

Works great with my 3 laptops!
Easy plug and play mini microphone. As I got tired of hooking up a mic on a stand or putting a headset on this little guy conveniently plugs into one of my USB ports and I forget about it - nothing that dangles or flops around. The sound quality is very nice and volume easily adjustable. One of the reviews here have been negative but there are two products - one is a mic and the other a playback only device which I have not tried.

Works great for my headphones
I broke the headphone jack on my laptop, and to get it fixed would cost me hundreds because it's part of the motherboard. So i got this and it works fine for my headphones or external speakers. It uses its own sound card which is pretty decent. My internal sound card is pretty basic itself anyway. I don't use the microphone function so i cant comment on that.

Good product
I was convinced the only way I could ever get my sound back on my laptop was to get it fixed when my audio input jack was broken, but after doing some searching I found a product like this to try out. It has worked wonderfully and saved me a lot of money since I don't need to get the whole computer fixed now for sound and I don't have to deal with no sound at all. The speakers are a little more sensitive when you turn them up with this (it can go from being really quiet to suddenly pretty loud, but not that bad), but I would gladly pay the few dollars for this alternative for paying a few hundred dollars if not more to get the audio input jack fixed, which actually requires replacing the whole motherboard or something extreme like that if I remember correctly.

Sound is Great!  Instalation fool proof!
I upgraded my home theater pc to vista with a sound card that was incompatible. Plugged this thing in and instant sound.  Sound is great.  I do not use a mic so cannot comment on its quality.  If you want sound from your computer do not hesitate to buy this!

Tested this out on two different headsets...
I am very pleased with the converter. I got this because the port hole in my laptop broke. I have tried this converter on 2 headsets. <br /><br />   On the Logitech Premium Stereo, the Microphone quality was the exact same. Sound however was worse, added fuzz, it was OK but poor. <br />    <br />   On the Razer Piranna (high quality gaming), BOTH functions worked PERFECTLY! I'm very happy!<br /><br />...which leads me to think, that the better the headset, the better results you will have.<br />   <br />   In reading some of the reviews, it seems like people are expecting the converter to improve their headset, when you really only can expect it to be the same.<br /><br />Great product, Very cheap! If you have the Razer Piranna don't hesitate and get this product now.

You can't go wrong with this little adapter.  I am using it on my iBook G4, for audio input (microphone).  It works just fine.  I looked at a number of other items which were more pricey and had cords to mess with.  This adapter plugs right into the usb port and you mic or headphones plug into it.  It works great for my needs.  I've also checked it out with headphones, and it works fine.  I recommend this item.

Great!
I was kinda iffy about getting this product, considering what other's said about it. It works great, for me. I have to make sure my speakers aren't on when I turn on the computer or turn it off (because it causes a loud crack to come from my speakers when the device turns on or off, with the computer), but other than that, it works fine. There was mild static, but I got rid of that by messing with the treble and bass setting on my actual speakers. I am thrilled the product works so well!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
You can not beat the price for performance.
If you notice there are reviews all over the place.  The reason for this is because those that are not getting good performance are not setting them up correctly in windows.  After you install the USB device in a USB 2 connector (not a USB 1) you have to go into the windows volume control panel and be sure to select it (USB) as the device to be used.  Otherwise it will still be set on your internal sound card. It is best to disable the internal sound card or else you may end up with noise you don't want.  If you set it up correctly it works beautifully and for a fraction of the cost of a new soundcard.

Great
I love it, it works well with my PS3 and PC, it has great sound through the Headphones, it is very good if you dont want to spend the extra money on a PS3 headset when you can buy a PC headset for $5 or less, so it is alot cheaper alternative for a PS3 headset!

A miracle!
Nearly a year ago I apparently blew up the soundcard in my Mac and have gone without sound all that time. Then I bought this tiny little gadget, not really thinking it would help, but at that price it was worth a try. When I plugged it in, it was like a miracle! Very loud sound from my formerly silent computer! I didn't expect my microphone to work in it either because Macs will only accept line level microphone input (which requires a powered mic). But my regular mic worked anyway -- not as loud as a powered mic would be, but louder than I had expected (I expected no sound at all). I'm a bit angry that I didn't discover this thing several months earlier.

Works great even in Linux
Does everything I expected it to do. I wanted this for my linux system and it worked just fine (under RHEL 5.2). I haven't tried it in Windows but I'm sure it works there too. Another USB sound card I tried from logitech worked in linux as well but for some reason I wasn't able to adjust the software volume level with it. With this one I can, so it's even better. Great product and cheap!

Really cranks out the audio.
I play audio from my laptop to my stereo via a 10' cord. After tripping over the cord, I cracked the audio output, rendering it useless. I thought I would give this inexpensive usb device a try. I was quite shocked, it really cranks out the audio, without the high-end distortion of my $1400 HP laptop. It sounds MUCH better than the original on-board audio. We live in an amazing age, this little sucker is comprised of a single chip with a teensy capacitor on top of it. That's all it takes to do all the work. It also has two LED's which immediately stopped working, but are entirely superfluous. You may need some tape to keep the plastic shell together.<br />Allegedly supports all kinds of fancy audio imaging, but I haven't tested it with DVD's.<br />This is the ultimate jury-rigged plug-and-play solution, as well as an incredibly cheap upgrade for poor or non-existent sound on your PC.<br />As a note, I bought this on Ebay; I am mentioning this because someone doesn't like the vendor here. I imagine there is a sole-source for the usb audio decoder chip, so all the units will be virtually identical.<br />As a note, volume level is controlled by "wave" settings in the volume control - not "volume." This took me a little while to figure out.<br />

Buy 'em by the sack!
I ordered one of these some time ago to use with a PowerMac G5 Quad so I could have a microphone jack at the front panel.  It works just fine.  I have heard the buzzes and static that other reviewers have mentioned but a simple un-plug and re-plug of the headset (or sometimes the whole USB adapter) and the noise is eliminated.  <br /><br />I have also used it on a Windoze box I have that has a funky front panel headphone jack.  It is instantly recognized by both Mac OS X and Windows and is configured into system operation in a few seconds at most.  What else can you get for less than five bucks for a computer that works as well??

My sound card totally freaked out a few months ago and wouldn't play songs, then I finally got a bit of garbled audio out of it. Had to buy a $120 Wireless Stereo headphone. But I think that this sound card adapter is perfect. I just took  it out of the box, plugged it in and started listening to my favorite music!! It was so easy. There's a built-in light that blinks only  when it is in use ( i thought that was cool). All in all, it is cheap and effective. I would recommend it to anybody.

Good Value
For the money you can't beat it.  With four kids I go through batteries by the case and have often had issues with generic brands.  These batteries were better than other generics I have tried at a discount to the name brands.  Recommended.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Tested Voltage and Was Good
After reading all the reviews on these batteries and seeing that they were pretty hit and miss, I decided to follow in the footsteps of another reviewer and do some testing.  I ordered a 100 pack of AA Ultralast alkaline batteries and found the best deal I could find on some name brand batteries.  I ended up finding a 36 pack of Energizer AAs at Home Depot for $14 which made them 42 cents each after tax.  These Ultralasts came in a 23 cents each after free shipping and no tax.  I pulled out my trusty multimeter once they arrived and went to town.  I tested 10 of the Energizers (28% of the package quantity) and they all metered at 1.61 volts right out of the package.  The Ultralasts are packaged as 10 shrink wrapped packs of 10.  So, I poked the sharp ends of the multimeter probes thru the plastic shrink wrap to test 4 out of each pack of 10 (40% of the total package quantity).  I did this so that if they tested out low, I could return them with less likelyhood of any issues of acceptance.  So, of the 40 batteries that I tested, most of them metered at 1.62 volts with a handful metering at 1.63 volts; better than the Energizers!  I have no way of testing milliamp hours (mAh) so have no way to determine if the overall capacity is equal but from the reading up I did on alkaline batteries, the concensus seems to be that the TYPE of battery is going to have pretty much the same capacity regardless of manufacturer. (I Googled "all alkaline batteries the same" and read some of the various resulting articles/blogs/etc) Obviously an alkaline battery is going to have more capacity than a carbon battery and a lithium ion battery will have more than an alkaline but there are only so many mAh that any manufacturer can cram into a single AA battery.  It sounds like some buyers may have gotten a bad batch but I think they're worth ordering.  Test a few and if you get a bad batch, return them.

Great Value Batteries
I absolutely love these batteries!  We have gone through 1/2 the box now without any issue.  At this price we took the batteries to church and repowered up all the nursery toys.  I was a bit worried reading the reviews about the batteries leaking, but so far we have not had an incident.  Saying that though, we don't put these batteries in expensive equipment.  They go in the kids cheaper toys, tv remote, stereo remotes, wireless mice, etc...  The Logitech remotes, cameras, etc... get high quality rechargeable.  At this price we keep extras in the cars and wifes purse.  You never know when you will need a battery.  They are also great for science experiments, boy scout projects, and anything where you don't want to drop $6 on name brand batteries.

I have no problems with these.  Maybe I got lucky?
Maybe I got lucky.  I've used about 60 out of the 100 pack, and all of them were perfect.<br /><br />I got these for the Wii and the XBOX 360 controllers.  And they always come up with full bars, and they never start fading prematurely.  When I'm using the Wii regularly (2-4 hours a day), the batteries start fading after a week.  I've seen the batteries in the Wii go dead after no use countless times, but this happened all the time with Duracell batteries too.  Its the fault of the controller.  I got tired of expensive Duracell batteries going dead after one small session with the Wii controller.  So I figured I'd get the cheap ones, and not care about the Wii burning batteries when I'm not using it because these are so darn cheap.<br /><br />Forget about these reviews and just try them out.  You can try a smaller pack.  They also sell these at Frys Electronics, and if they are really that bad as some of these comments say (half dead out of the box which is absurd and not true in my case), you can definitely return them.  Worst case scenario you lose a few bucks.  Best case scenario you save a lot of money.  Until I get a bad batch, I'm a customer for life.  I won't buy any other brand these days for my game controllers and remotes.<br /><br />I understand that there is a tradeoff and there will be some inconsistancies with quality control, but for 1/4 to 1/2 the price I am not expecting military grade.

Great Value Batteries
I absolutely love these batteries!  We have gone through 1/2 the box now without any issue.  At this price we took the batteries to church and repowered up all the nursery toys.  I was a bit worried reading the reviews about the batteries leaking, but so far we have not had an incident.  Saying that though, we don't put these batteries in expensive equipment.  They go in the kids cheaper toys, tv remote, stereo remotes, wireless mice, etc...  The Logitech remotes, cameras, etc... get high quality rechargeable.  At this price we keep extras in the cars and wifes purse.  You never know when you will need a battery.  They are also great for science experiments, boy scout projects, and anything where you don't want to drop $6 on name brand batteries.

Worked
The charger that came with my laptop became very corroded right where it connects, and my laptop wouldn't charge.  My battery power was at 2% and I had to sit near an outlet to use my computer; if the charger fell out the computer would instantly die.  So I started looking for a replacement.  <br /><br />I was a bit nervous about this charger working on my Dell 1501 when it claimed to work on 26 different models, but it matched the specs of my current charger--65W, 19.5V--and the price was hard to beat.  On the Dell website they wanted $80 for a replacement charger, one that was only 3 feet long!  So I gave this a try.  It looks a bit different from my old charger, but it works, and my laptop is charging as we speak, for the first time in a month.  Seller SIB shipped it quite fast; it arrived on the third day after ordering, and I only paid for standard shipping.<br /><br />We'll see if I have any long term issues, but at this point it looks like I got a better charger (about seven feet long instead of three) at just over a quarter of the price I would have paid by going through Dell for an "official" replacement.<br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE 11-23-09: Bear in mind that extra parts like the charger are sometimes included in your computer's service warranty, if you purchased one.  It turns out that my warranty did include the charger, so I really didn't have to buy this charger at all.  And since I threw out my old Dell charger when I bought this non-Dell one, I don't have it anymore to exchange for a new Dell one!

Kudos!
This item was just what was needed.  The laptop battery was dead and appeared not to hold a charge.  I ordered an adapter previously that would only feed power to the laptop when plugged into an outlet.  Each time the laptop was unplugged (i.e., to be moved to another room) we would get a startup error that the laptop was not shut down correctly.  Taking a chance, I ordered this adapter and I am extremely happy with the purchase - shipping was prompt, and the product allows AC usage AND charges the battery. Kudos!

Great buy, don't waste your money with Dell!
This cord is great, a super buy! You can't beat the price and it works, what else can I say? I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 and my Dell-issue cord randomly died one day, hence the replacement. I wasn't that impressed with the life of the Dell cord so I thought why not save some money here? My battery was fully charged within minutes of plugging in the new cord and the computer is back to its old self. Go ahead and buy this cord with confidence and pat yourself on the back for being smart and thrifty.

Just as I hoped!
It came on time and I use it everyday!  I have one already, but I get annoyed transferring it up and down the stairs.  Now I have a power cord for both upstairs and down!  THANK YOU!

GREAT PURCHASE
This is a great substitute for the real DELL product. Just make sure the numbers on the back are the same or compatible with your laptop adapter because if not you could fry your laptop. I have Inspiron 1521 and I matched the numbers on the back of my DELL adapter to find this product and it works great. Keep as a spare if need be. I will purchase this product again.

Great lower cost option over the Apple brand.
Apple's battery is overpriced.  This battery works great and is a terrific replacement, especially at half the price.  It fits the battery slot just fine and keeps a full charge that lasts as long as the original.  My wife thinks it is better, but I think she got use to limping along with the bad cell.  We are very happy and would recommend this battery over a new Apple brand.

Great battery - Great price
I know there are a lot of complaints on here about this but I haven't had one of them. The shipping was fast and reasonable.  The replacement battery is very good so far.  It's like almost identical to the original with the exception of a darker silver color than the rest of the body but it's on the bottom, who cares?  It's 1/3 the price of a Apple bat.  Fit is pretty good, sticks out just a hair.  It's not enough to really notice but if you run your finger over it towards the rear, you can feel it but it's hard to detect visually.  I charged it last night and this morning I let it run on battery and I was getting a little over 2 hours.  That's about the same I got with the original battery, maybe a little less.  On that two hours of charge time, I was working on normal type stuff - checking email, web surfing, checking and changing settings (just upgraded to Snow Leopard).  I haven't tried watching a movie on battery yet.<br /><br />I took a chance on this one and so far, so good.

Laptop battery rated 5-star
Replacement battery for my Apple laptop was an Amazon Verified Purchase. The battery performs well, is fully satisfactory, service through Amazon was excellent as usual. Price was moderate, have identified and recommended source to another person (a relative), will do so to others it fits to do so.

Quality replacement
I wasn't too sure about this particular brand battery since there were no reviews for it, but I decided to give them a try and see what I ended up with. First they look and feel (weight wise) exactly the same as the Nikon batteries. The only difference is the labeling. Even the color is exactly the same. I have shot a large number of pictures with my D200 since and have seen virtually the same performance out of these as my Nikon batteries, maybe even a little longer lasting if you want to be nit picky. Maybe they wont last as long, but time will tell. Just remember with lith ion batteries re-charging is best done early and often. If you do that your batteries will last you a good long time. I can't vouch for other Nikon camera models, but these DO work in the D200. I hope this helps out some of you out there wanting to save a little money on your batteries like me. Good luck and keep shooting!!!

Same as Nikon
I got this so I would have an extra battery for my Nikon D90. It looks and feels just like the Nikon battery; just a different color and lower price (and I did get a cover with mine). I used it after I charged it up overnight in the Nikon charger and it took over 400 pictures with an auto-focus, vibration-reduction lens and still had a little power left over. I recharged it and it did not get hot while recharging. I can't say it is better than a Nikon battery, but I will say it's just as good. Shipping was quick and the packaging was adequate. I can recommend this battery.

Works well on D90
To keep it short, i was also skeptical of third party brand batteries. I've had the battery for a week or so now, its at 37% after 900 shots... Time will tell if it last long, but for [...] bucks i can't complain.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
So far so good.
This battery has been performing well.  I use it in my D90 battery grip and notice no difference when put side by side with the Nikon Battery.<br /><br />Follow-up.<br />I have been using this battery for almost a year and it is still performing as well as the Nikon.  No issues with splitting which can happen with cheap aftermarket power cells.  I use this side by side in a battery grip so it is easy to judge the performance of the battery against the Nikon.  For less than $20.00 it is still a good battery.

GREAT PRODUCT
PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT IT WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO ME.  THE BATTERIES LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THE ONES THAT CAME WITH MY D200.  I USE THEM WITH DARKROOM PRO TETHERED TO THE COMPUTER WHICH CAUSES THE BATTERIES TO DRAIN FASTER AND LET ME TELL U THEY DO NOT DRAIN AS FAST AS THE OTHERS.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THESE BATTERIES AND I'M GOING TO PURCHASE 3 MORE ADDITIONAL BATTERIES FOR MY BACKUP CAMERA AND SINCE I USE A BATTERY GRIP I NEED 2 FOR EACH CAMERA AND A BACKUP.  I CURRENTLY HAVE 2 OF THESE BATTERIES AND I'M GOING TO PURCHASE 3 MORE.

Well-priced spare or replacement battery
This battery works fine for my D70s. It has 2000 mAh compared to the Nikon 1500mAh. The case is brownish grey, not grey like the original and slips into the camera a tad less smooth than the original. <br /><br />Most important: you get what you see: cardboard box, tiny plastic bag, battery. No cover. Go to your attic and get the battery cover out of the original Nikon box where you left it when you originally assembled the rig. <br /><br />I don't know how much it would drive the price up but a battery cover would be a sensible add-on.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Completely Satisfied
Yes! Go ahead and purchase this battery! If you are reading this review and you are not sure if an off-brand battery is worth buying, let me be the one to assure you. This battery is pretty much the same as the one that came with my D90. Charges, performs and fits like the Nikon brand EN-EL3e battery. If you are stingy about the differences, the Nikon brand battery is a darker shade of grey than it's Opteka clone. Let me remind you that this difference does not effect the performance or quality of the battery itself.<br />Having this battery is nice since I'm doing a lot of video work with the D90. I have an external Nikon SB-400 flash unit so i dont have to worry about the camera battery's juice getting sucked up.

Excellent battery
Inexpencive replacement battery. Everything works fine, the camera recognizes it, shows the charge, it holds out as long as the Nikon equivelant. <br /><br />i would reccommend this.

Works in my D300s
This may be too early to review this but...<br />I bought this for my D300s. After the first charge it has lasted longer than either of the two Nikon batteries that I have (not combined of course). My Nikons usually go less than half in a day of shooting. This one lasted three days and still shows over half left a week later. It fits just like the Nikons and seems to be built as well. <br /><br />I will update if things change after a few charges. <br />One thing I have noticed is that there are a lot of complaints by D90 owners on many different accessories not just the batteries. I have the D300s and a D50 and have had no problems with either camera. The D90 is probably the most popular camera sold and maybe it has more problems due to the volume manufactured. <br /><br />

Just as good as the real thing
It looks identical to the Nikon battery, without the Nikon logo.  I got about 500 pictures out of this battery on my D200, about the same as the Nikon battery.  It's just as good as the real thing.

Works great in my D700
I had doubt on 3rd party batteries before I bought this one for my D700. I was pleasantly surprised how long it lasts! Moreover, It seems that it loses less power than Nikon battery when not used for several months. A good deal for the price.

Excellent features, price and quality photographs!
I recently purchase the Nikon Coolpix L20 after lots of shopping.  <br /><br />I have used only Olympus cameras only up to now. <br /><br />This time I wanted a smaller pocket sized camera, that still took the AA batteries, and that still gave great photos with all the features I was used to.<br />This camera fit the bill! <br /> <br />It takes 2 AA batteries, inexpensive SD memory cards and yet still delivers fantastic photos.  <br /><br />I have already tried all the features, and was completly happy.  <br />I love using the different scene settings, and could not live without the video feature.  <br />Both still and video capture worked well in both bright light and low light.  <br />The sound playback via the camera is hard to distinquish (live music), but fine once uploaded.<br />I didn't really require the smile feature, but tried it out on my 3 year old, and was blown away....it really works!<br />The blink feature is also quite ingenious.  The camera actually asks you if your subject blinked when they do, but not when they don't.  This is particularly handy when taking photos of children.  I would have loved this feature when I was still my daughter's yearbook photographer.<br /><br />What can I say, fabulous price and awesome quality!!!  <br />Definately worth the money.  <br /><br />Comparibly priced camera's that we have used, produce grainy shots.....but have not found this with this camera at all.<br />I would recommend this camera to anyone!

Unless you need a really long-lens telephoto and billboard sized prints, this is the perfect camera for every use
This is a professional camera capable of crystal clear prints worthy of publication or gallery display, up to 16x20.<br /><br />And it is incredibly inexpensive for a camera of such value.<br /><br />Ok, so its 3.6 optical zoom won't pick sand off an eagle's beak at a thousand yards. Okay, so it won't blow up to billboard size without loss of definition. In the real world however and everyday use this is a fine and professional level camera that will do a far better job than you expected. Better than a cell-phone.<br /><br />Disguised as a point and shoot. That's what makes it very effective; people are not intimidated by it. You can get right up to them, and it looks like any other camera. Yet, it is more.<br /><br />In fact, the generous three inch LCD screen means you do not have to hold it to your face. There is no optical viewfinder in any case. So you can hold it at your hip and glance down at it to compose, and snap shots while engaging the subject in small talk comfortably. I have done this effectively with Tarahumara Indian children in northern Chihuahua who normally run quickly from any camera. It works, and came out great. And that large LCD screen has a high-contrast, anti-reflection coating which keeps it clear even in strong sunlight. <br /><br />This camera is an improvement over the earlier, wonderful Coolpix, such as the great 8 megapix <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011N180Q">Nikon Coolpix L18 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Ruby Red)</a> mainly because it has ten megapix capability. The earlier accessories such as the AC adapter, the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FUIKEI">Nikon EH-65A AC Adapter</a>, are transferable if you have a long shoot to do in one place (like a schoolful of children, which I have done) or other reason to go off-battery. Nevertheless, a pair of Energizer e&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> "AA" Lithium Batteries For digital cameras, portable audio players, and more last in here last forever.<br /><br />Your old Coolpix camera pouch also still fits; use it and protect your investment. I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P935EI">Rokinon Compact Digital Camera Padded Carrying Case for Canon Powershot, Casio Exilim, Fuji Finepix, (GE) General Electric, Kodak EasyShare, Nikon Coolpix, Olympus FE Stylus, Panasonic Lumix, Pentax Optio, Sony CyberShot and Samsung Digital Cameras</a>.<br /><br />Also new here, aside from the greater megapixels, is the new Expeed image processing system specially fine-tuned for the Coolpix series "to render natural-looking pictures of incredible quality and quick response" as if the earlier system of digital processing was not fine enough! Amateur enthusiasts will find their photos reaching a new magnitude of quality; even the professional will leave his camera bag and lenses at home (okay, so she might miss her long lens, but macro here gets in to two inches).<br /><br />The ISO settings are phenomenal, stretching from 64 ISO all  the way out to 1600. Over twenty years ago when I was doing photo-journalism in Nicaragua, we used 64 for our slide film and 1600 was just coming on the horizon, very grainy but with a special charm for low light situations, like oil lamp, etc. Here you can do very low light and candlelight  (if you do not mind some grain effect), and in fact there are special pre-sets which employ the faster ISO's effectively.<br /><br />This is another expansion over the prior Coolpix L series. You can choose instead of Auto (with own its user-selected options) to use the pre-set "Scene" selections quickly and efficiently. The Scene modes now include: Portrait, Night Portrait, Sports, Landscape, Party, Beach/Snow, Sunset, Dusk/Dawn, Night Landscape, Museum, Fireworks Show, Close Up, Copy, Back Light, Panorama Assist, Food. Food is one of the new ones, and you food photo-journalists might want to try it very inexpensively yet quite well here. The rest of the modes you can figure how they are set from the title and how you might apply their settings to similar situations; know that the Nikon impression of party might be much more sedate and candle-lit than the Animal House idea. This is not cheating, to use pre-sets; this is using the tool that you have in the way it was designed. Cheating would be setting this to its auto-scene setting in which it selects the Scene mode according to<br />prevailing conditions, automatically. Yes, this can do it.<br /><br />The panorama assist is great. You can take a series of photos in a row in either of four directions (left to right, up and down, etc.) overlapping by one third (I really appreciate the rule of thirds grid which you can bring up on the LCD, keeping the camera straight and well composed), and then unite them with the included software into one long (or tall) file. I had reason to do this the other day at a long new school. Things do not build vertical out here in the desert, but there is plenty of room for horizontal, and a special Cinerama style long photo framing. In fact you could line up your whole town along the sidewalk standing and take one long photo of everyone in town. Just find printer and paper!<br /><br />With the built in macro mode you can jump right into that cactus blossom from two inches away and have perfect focus. Take a photo of that baby's toes and blow them up to 16x20. Come in close to that ant stealing cracker crumbs on your picnic. This strength of macro was recently unimaginable, and yet here you have this power within a humble, tiny and inexpensive package.<br /><br />What I really love and appreciate is the SDHC compliancy. I can use as standard memory card a regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1O73A">Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card (SDSDB-4096, BULK, No Reader)</a> and have room for 500 shots at maximum resolution. You can truly, as we used to say a quarter century ago "shoot a roll; keep a shot."  Take all of the shots you can, and then pick one out to use and delete the rest. For someone who used to burn through boxes of film (at 36 shots each max) and then do the darkroom processing all night, and then find a free way to get more, this is like living in another, finer dimension. Of course, you can put even larger SD HC memory cards in here and if you ever do fill one up and have nothing more to put in there and no time to delete, this camera comes with a generous 20MB internal memory on hand.<br /><br />You can hook it up to the USB port of a computer directly and use the included software, or simply pop out the SD card and plug it into a reader and into the computer. Whatever works for you, although I do not like opening and closing the battery/card hatch too much. It is very strong and durable, but in the olden days I had a habit of snapping such things and putting them back together with duct tape. This one looks remarkably resilient nevertheless and has stood up to me.<br /><br />Speaking of shooting a roll to get the one picture, have you ever taken a shot to discover your subject blinked? This camera lets you know. Yes, this camera sees when your subject blinks, and lets you know, using the Smart Portrait system. It also automatically fixes your red-eye special. You'll never see red eye again. It finds faces, and automatically focuses on them, up to a dozen at a time. It can also snap the shutter automatically when someone finally dares to smile. And the D-lighting will save those details otherwise lost in darkness.<br /><br />As you can see, this camera does everything for you but serve as photo agency selling your work to Vogue or GQ. A great camera at a small price. What can go wrong?<br /><br />The most amazing thing for me, of course, an old still shooter, is that this tiny camera is also a video camera, with built in mike, and a built in speaker for playback. You can make movies with this at two different resolutions, either for television playback at 640x480 or laptop at 320x240 (good for e-mailing). These home movies are truly sharp, with the same excellent back to front focus as the photos, and surprisingly high quality sound. The length of the movie is limited only to the size of your SDHC card; you could easily go for feature length! Using .AVI files, it can easily be edited as well.<br /><br />Of course, this camera comes with the standard sized screw input for mounting on a tripod. I have used it on my Targus 66-inch heavy-duty tripod. Looks a little small up there, but it works great. You will really appreciate the steadiness a tripod always brings, and the freedom, no less with this great camera, which so thoughtfully has a tripod screw-in.<br /><br />Hey, for the same price, this is way better than a cell phone!<br /><br />Too bad this one is so, well, red!

A Jewel of a Camera
Contrary to the first commentor (I believe he had a defective product from the onset) I love my new L20. A jewel-like body containing every important feature one needs to take excellent pictures. And what a beautiful video capability that camera has! Very smooth, can zoom in during shooting and has long recording capability. Everything works just as advertised. The pictures are brilliant with correct balance of color intensity vs. sharpness and contrast. The Easy Auto feature is powerful and works every time to compose the right scene correctly. I love this camera - highly recommended especially at the price range it's being sold. I think it's underpriced.

a little misunderstood
Okay, so I don't usually make reviews here (a little too private). But I couldn't help but come to the rescue of this highly misunderstood product. Too much negative reviews for a product that actually delivers, IMO. I bought this item as a gift for my 11 year old daughter. Then when I looked at most of the reviews here, my heart sank. Should I have researched more? But being that hard headed as I am. Plus I don't like the headache of returning things, that I have already bought. I investigated more and really tested this product. First off, I noticed that mostly first time camera users seemed to have no problem with this camera (like a reviewer's fifth grader here or a grandpa). So what seems to be the problem? Okay, I found out this - most of us have been used to other digital cameras where you half pressed first on the shutter to focus before you press all the way and shoot. Well this camera has what you call an easy auto mode - wherein the camera does everything for you including focusing. With easy auto mode, it is just that - easy - just point, camera does it's job and shoot right away. Let the camera focus for you (it actually makes a sound) and once it does that then just shoot away. Don't even half press anymore and "wala" - very sharp pictures that even a fifth grader and grandpa could take. I have found out that in easy auto mode and then I half press to focus or don't click right away after the camera focuses - pictures come out so blurry. But, wow! Just follow what I say and the pictures are so sharp. The camera also has the standard auto mode, wherein you could half press first to focus (if you're used to that), and the pictures still come out so sharp. So there you go, this camera I highly recommend and is a good point and shoot camera that takes really sharp pictures. Don't believe me? Investigate for yourself and just follow what I did...

Nikon makes another Gem!
I own allot of point and shoots and I think the folks who gave this camera a less than 5 star rating must enjoy looking at horrible photos from other digital camera manufactures.<br />     The beautiful red colored body of the L20 is unisex and it's absolutely right in line with the jeweled quality of Nikon. I was able to use the camera right out of the box without having to read the instruction manual, it's that easy to use. You should however read the manual since there were allot of little gem features the camera had that I didn't know about.<br />     When I loaded my photos onto my PC with the supplied USB cable, the first thing I noticed was how natural the colors and skin tones appeared. White balance was incredibly accurate. The focus and detail were right on target and in some close up portraits the image had the appearance of a professional camera set in aperture priority. Macro mode and optical zoom worked flawlessly with no noticeable distortion or noise. <br />     The camera feels good in my hands and the controls are easy to find without having to take your eyes off your subject. The large 3 inch LCD view finder was easy to see in bright light. There is also a brightness control for the view finder to increase bright daylight viewing. This camera does not need an optical view finder. I always thought having an optical view finder on a point and shoot was dumb and Nikon picked up on that. <br />     The Nikon L20 comes with a one year manufactures warranty - "Not that you would need a warranty for a Nikon camera" - Impressive warranty details, I was amazed that any camera manufacturer would offer a one year on a point and shoot but Nikon has such a good reputation and so I doubt very much that you would even need to use it.<br />     In a nutshell, I love this camera so much that I would recommend this Nikon L20 to my friends, family and anyone else looking to buy. It's a real beauty!     <br />

Great Camera For a Great Price!
I owned a Nikon Coolpix (an earlier model) for about ten years (constant use) until I finally wore it out and needed to replace it.  When I bought this one, I immediately fell in love with it.  It produces sharp, clear pictures and could not be easier to use.  It has a nice, big preview screen which gives you a very good idea what your picture will look like.  This camera's settings allow you to take good, clear pictures of almost anything - sporting events, plays, birthday parties, evening functions, etc.  I cannot say enough about how terrific this camera is, and the price is amazing.  I would recommend it to anybody without reservation or restriction.

very nice
I do a lot of backpacking, so for me, size and weight are crucial issues (I still remember the old days of lugging around either a digital camera or a camcorder, because they were too heavy to take them both). Until recently, I was using a small point-and-shoot Polaroid 7MP for still photos, and an RCA Small Wonder to shoot 640x480 video (I shoot for the Web, so I can live without high def). Both worked well for what I needed, but the limited one-hour recording time for the Small Wonder was a<br />huge (but at the time unavoidable) annoyance--it required that I carry along an ASUS PC EEE netbook (which is also, by the way, a wonderful little machine) to download all the footage every time the camera got full.  So a few weeks ago, when some shmuck stole my fanny pack containing my Small Wonder (and a bag of raisins), I decided to use it as an opportunity to consolidate some things and save myself some weight. So the critera I set for a replacement camera was (1) had to do both video and still photos, (2) had to be able to use SD cards for storage so I wouldn't have to carry the ASUS laptop with me anymore, (3) had to be as small and light as possible, (4) had to use AA batteries instead of lithium-ion, and (5) since I'm poor, it had to be cheap cheap cheap.<br /><br />The Coolpix L20 fits all those.<br /><br />Some of the other cameras I considered, and the reasons why I rejected them:<br /><br />The Flip. Nice video camera, but it doesn't do stills, and the built-in non-expandable 2hr recording limit would be crippling for me. I was getting tired of lugging that ASUS around with me all the time. I'd much rather carry around just a couple SD cards.<br /><br />The Vado HD. This one does both photo and video (both standard VGA and 720p HD), and has 8G of internal memory, giving it more recording time than the Flip.  I liked it. But it was important for me to have an expandable storage capacity, and the Vado doesn't take cards. It also uses a lithium-ion battery, and I wanted something that used AA's. So I had to rule it out.<br /><br />The Kodak Zi8. This really looked like a great camera, and I considered it very very carefully. It has almost everything I wanted (and real 1080p High-Def, to boot). It alllmmmooosssttt went into my pack. Ultimately, though, the reason I rejected it was because it uses a lithium-ion battery instead of AA's.  For most people that probably wouldn't be a problem (although it might be a problem that the Zi8 costs twice as much as the L20). For me, though, AA batteries were a necessity, since I use a solar panel to charge the camera in the field, and finding a AA charger that will work off a solar panel is easy, but finding a lithium-ion charger that works with solar is not easy at all. There is also the advantage that, no matter what flyspeck of a little town I might happen to wander into off the trail, I can *always* find AA batteries somewhere if I need them. It's just worlds more convenient to be able to use readily-available rechargeable AA's instead of proprietary lithium-ion. And of course it's better for our Mother Earth, too.<br /><br />So I went with the Coolpix, and have not regretted it. Is the photographic or video quality as good as a pricey high-end model?  Nope. But it's pretty darn good. Unless you're a professional photographer shooting for National Geographic or something, this little camera will do everything you need to do, especially if you use a mini-tripod. As for the video, if you want super-sharp broadcast-quality high def, then this ain't the camera for you.  But if you just want to shoot video of your vacation or your kids for YouTube, FaceBook, or email, this will do the job admirably.<br /><br />My only real concern was how well it would stand up to being in the wild for extended periods of time. So far, though, my worries have been groundless.  Although I try to protect it from rain, mud, sand and dust as much as I can (ziploc baggies are a backpacker's friend), it's still gotten a pretty good amount of abuse with me, and came through just fine. It even got accidentally dropped once with no ill effect (something I don't recommend you try for yourself).<br /><br />Of course I realize that most people probably don't have the specific requirements for a camera that I did.  But if you're just looking for a good basic video/still camera, with the convenience of readily-available batteries, this one is pretty hard to beat.<br /><br /><br />

Just what I wanted
I researched alot of cameras to get just what I wanted. This is definitely it. The price was great. I got everything I wanted on it(smile,red eye,motion stabilizer etc.)We took pictures of fireworks and a video of them and it turned out fantastic! It is very easy to use. Make sure you get a card,as the camera itself only holds 10 pictures. I would recommend this camera to everyone.

Great camera. Don't listen to bad reviews. Blurry pictures are due to people not reading the guide or product being a lemon.
The camera works great! I seriously believe that the bad reviews are from people who either unfortunately got a lemon, or who were too impatient to read the manual before playing around with the camera. The quick start guide is not enough...read the manual before posting a bad review.<br /><br />The guide is extensive, but very very informative and explains exactly which features are available with each setting...you can set many things manually if you want. However, setting the camera on normal Auto mode (not Easy Auto) takes great pictures. We even took pictures from a moving vehicle (we were on the freeway!) and the images were not blurry at all. To the people who have complained about the pictures having a yellow hue to them, they probably had the setting accidentally set to Macro. <br /><br />The videos come out great with good sound quality and image.

THE GREATEST COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA
I have taking pictures with film cameras for a long time with all well known cameras. I did close up of flowers, insects, landscapes, portraits, etc. I hesitate to change to digital due to high prices for my budget and have been reading all reviews and description of the most current models. In the meantime the film prices and developing services were going up. Many manufactures of photo film are not manufacturing film any more.<br /><br />Then my daughter came to visit us during her vacation and had this little mighty camera NIKON LC20. I asked her to take a picture for one of my vintage camera sat out at the front door. The results were superb. I could not believe the quality in detail, color and clarity.<br /><br />Amazon had it with a great price and I made my move and acquired one. I can tell you how happy I am with this little giant camera. With 10 Mega pixels and the wide and telephoto lens are great. The software is very friendly and was able to handle the problems that other buyer had, according to some reviews, blurred pictures is controlled when you hold the camera very firm. The quality clue, is to select the amount of pixels for each picture. I am using normal and the quality on all of them are great. <br /><br />The camera size is small, true, but you have to get use it, to how to handle. I will like to see a camera with a faster lens, perhaps 1:2.0 and more telephoto power, maybe 10X. Pixels are enough. This camera with those feaatures will make any other ones so obsolete. I consider to get another when that one is available.

It's a Giant Killer - Superb Pocket Camera!
This is a superb little pocket camera that is all Nikon from start to finish - and the finish by the way is beautiful.<br /><br />I've had the camera a couple days and I just don't want to put it down! I have a NIKON D50 SLR for those really precious jobs, and I wanted a small camera I could have in the pocket sort of "all the time." I tried several small ultra-compact cameras and I hated them all. Too many weird buttons that made quick operation all but impossible without carrying around a telephone book sized manual. I mean, after all, what's the purpose of a pocket camera, if not to whip it out on a whim and get a quick picture? <br /><br />Here's three things I really like about this baby.<br />1. There are four key buttons on the top deck: Power, Shooting mode, Review pictures and the shutter button. Pull the camera out, hit the power button and you can take a picture in a second. No fumbling, no hunting for the right button. It is logical, easy to remember and doesn't overwhelm you with a billion choices before you can take a picture. <br /><br />2. It takes AA batteries. Cool, I have boxes of AA and I don't need YET ANOTHER little charger! Plus, there won't be a bum lithium battery to try to replace in two years. AA batts are cheap and in this camera they last a long time.<br /><br />3. The LCD screen is HUGE, bright, and gives a great preview or slideshow. <br /><br />Here's the one thing I don't like: It's a bit fatter than my wife's 20mm Olympus. It's more like 1.1" thick. Not unmanageable, but it's as large as you'd really want for this kind of camera. It's the AA batteries that make it a bit thicker. BUT---shooting with this gem is 10X faster and easier than with my wife's compact Oly - (which is the most confusing menu system I've ever seen on any product in my life. )<br /><br />Oh, the pictures? So far I think they are fabulous. This is a 10MP camera - - how much do you need for a pocket camera? With a 4GB standard SD card you can get like 1000 pictures! That's a long party!<br /><br />Everything about this camera feels like a well made sports car - I may just pack up that big SLR and ......well, maybe not. But this will get plenty of use.

Raves
I really like this camera. I like that I don't have to buy special batteries for it. I can use rechargeable AA's or, in a pinch find AA's anywhere. I don't have to worry about a special battery needing to be charged, or purchase more (expensive) special batteries for backup. This camera was delivered ahead of schedule and the price was nice. I've purchased three of these for myself and family over the past two years.

GREAT Product if you READ THE MANUAL!
I've eliminated mountains of paper from my desk using this product.  After installing the software and calibrating the scanner it took me little time to record and store my documents electronically.  The key is to read over the manual to expose the more useful features of this product such as dragging pages of a multi-page document together to form a single document and how to properly edit a reciept after it has been scanned.  Also make sure that if/when you backup your database that it goes to an external media such as an external hard drive, flash drive, or cd. <br /><br />Reading in an arbitrary document and extracting information from it is a DIFFICULT computer science problem (I'm a CS Grad Student) and this program does a pretty good job of pulling info from what are now commonly cluttered receipts.  Follow the instructions carefully for setup, watch the video they provide, read over the manual [....], check out the video tutorials [....] and you'll discover just how useful this software can be.

First product delivered would not install.  Easily returned item to seller prepaid and received replacement promptly.  Install was simple and was up and running in less than 10 minutes from opening the box.  Would prefer that categorization of receipts could be customized more instead of just selecting from pre-programmed drop-down list.<br /><br />Scans very quietly and fast.  Scanned images are very good quality.  Believe the more I use the device the more I will like it.<br /><br />Appreciated the super service on the original shipment and was really pleased with the handling of the return of the defective product.  KMSales is a great vendor.

Thank You Neat Co. & Amazon
If your looking to store your receipts for insurance or tax purposes, look no further. Neat Receipts Model 0346 is your solution.I was amazed at how well this scanner works. I have stored receipts in boxes for years, just in case I ever need them for insurance purposes.I was amazed at how well the scanner works scanning my old receipts. I was afraid that a lot of my older receipts would not scan, because they faded from old age, but I was wrong, only a few receipts did not scan properly.<br />Great Job Neat Co. & Great Price Amazon

Amazing Organization Tool
I went to the store looking for the Neat Receipts scanner, and I came across this new product. I could not be more happy for buying it! I had 4 years worth of credit card and bank statements piled up in boxes, and with this scanner system I was able to scan them and organize them on my computer in less than a day (I'm talking hundreds of pages).<br /><br />I have absolutely no complaints on this (other than the price, which is high, but it is a new product and it will come down).<br /><br />The scanner can read 2 sided documents and scan both sides, in color! And it does it fast.<br /><br />It also reads receipts and business cards and extracts the information from them (such as what store the receipt is from, how much total was, how much tax was, date of transaction, etc...) The best part about this feature is that it lets you edit the information (sometimes necessary if the receipt was very worn or wrinkled.<br /><br />The software is extremely easy to use and very powerful. A great feature about the scanner/software is that you can load a bunch of pages and start scanning them. While they scan you can work on filing other documents. Once the pages are scanned they go into a sort of "inbox" where they wait for you to look at them and decide where to file them.<br /><br />The two sided, color scanning is great and very fast. Another convenient feature the program has is the ability to combine several pages into one document. All you do is click on the different pages while holding down control and click combine ... and you have one file for a multi page document! <br /><br />All the files you scan into the program are searchable, so you can enter a search term and it will bring up all the documents (or receipts or business cards, depending on which section you are searching in). Very handy to search back on when you bought something...<br /><br />Another great feature for those that do not receive paper statements is the pdf import feature! If you get your statements from online, you can still import the file into the program (as if you had scanned it in yourself) and have the searchable capabilites of the other files.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is probably not a good scanner to scan pictures with, but for a document scanner, it is fast, and very good. I just hope it lasts the wear and tear I'm subjecting it to right now. I am very thankful that this product has helped me get rid of all of my paper clutter!!!

Amazing Scanner!
I am someone who travels a lot and need to submit expense reports.  I love this printer.  It allows me to scan business cards, receipts and full size pages all at once.  Then, it inputs the data into reports and databases with accuracy and clarity.  It is awesome that it can scan all types of sizes at once and quickly.  The older scanner was nice because it was portable, but it was slow and receipts would not stay aligned as well. <br /><br />I keep this at my desk, load it up, and hit "scan."  Its that easy!  You can easily scan to a PDF as well, when wanting to send attachments in emails.  The IRS accepts these scanned PDFs for tax purposes.  <br /><br />I like the look of the product too.  Plus, it is quick and small, and fits nicely on my desk.  I cannot recommend this product enough, and I used to use CardSCan for my cards and Neat Receipts for receipts.  This does it all.

Don't know how I got along without it!
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CQ8ER2">The Neat Company NeatDesk Desktop Scanner and Digital Filing System (White)</a><br /><br />This makes filing so much easier, and I like how it "learns" information about items I've scanned such as a bank statement. If it isn't able to recognize the name the first time, it does after that.<br /><br />Also like the fact that at the end of a year or whenever, I can export groups of documents to searchable PDF (all text in the image is searchable), so I can archive documents at the end of the year.<br /><br />This thing is great, and by far the fastest scanner I've ever had (in double-sided mode in black and white anyway).

I LOVE THIS SCANNER!
I work in a small office for a company that sells medical supplies. We purchased this scanner, and in the course of 8 months, we have gone paperless in the office!  I was able to scan all of the patient charts into the computer, and easily export the pdf files to our server.  We are not computer experts, and had no trouble figuring out the software. I have had to call the company a couple of times for software glitches - mainly caused by my overtaxing the software, but I have always received help with a minimal amount of wait time.  This is a fast scanner that can also scan in color or b/w on one or two sides. Depending on your application, you will have to back up and archive folders as they start getting too full (I'm talking over 5000 pages)or use it to make PDF files. It was the perfect solution for us, and was faster and more economical than any other scanner we looked at. Well worth buying!

Using my G4050 for scanning slides
I've been using my G4050 on a Vista system for about a month and it works great.  Looking at some of the negatives other reviewers have listed, I have to say it works great with Vista and does remember settings (if yoy tell it to).  If your scanning slides like me, be sure to preview and edit the scan area as the default scan can miss the image a little.  Just don't take all of the highest resolution settings, for slides they are a waste.  I have a brand new Duo Core system and it took 45 minutes to open a slide because it had so much detail.  At 2400 and with the 6 color scan I have no such problem.  Enjoy!

The Best for the Bucks
Totally pleased!!!  I was looking for a scanner to digitalize over 4000 slides and family photos.  After looking narrowing my choices to Canon, Epson, and HP from online reviews I went to a local store to look at the scanners.  Most of the "professional reviews" seemed to favor the Canon or Epson.  But for me, the quality of construction of the HP was evident from my hands on inspection.  And best of all the HP is set up to scan sixteen 35m slides at a time.  To save over fifty dollars over the store price, I ordered the HP online.<br /><br />When the scanner arrived, I did the recommended set up and it was easy and smooth.  I found using the HP scanning software (HP Solution Center) to be simple enough.  Be sure to recognize that if you have other HP products, they will also be in the HP Solutions Center and you will have to select the scanner tab.  It took me several trys to find the balance between quality and speed that fit my needs.  But once I locked the settings in my scanning has moved along nicely.  You will be pleased with the quality and performance.<br /><br />

Great scanner, great support
I purchased this scanner for the purpose of digitizing our family collection of slides, photographs and other important documents that I want to save electronically.  The setup was easy and the instructions were clear.<br /><br />I encountered difficulty making the connection between the scanner and my computer.  So after trying all of the suggested troubleshooting steps, I called the HP support line received excellent patient assistance which has resulted in wonderful scanning experiences.<br /><br />I would make the same purchase all over again.

Beautiful scans, amazing color reproduction.
I'm glad I bought it before it had all the negative reviews, if I read all the problems listed in the other reviews I would have moved on to a different scanner.  But this has worked great for me from day one and I really love it.<br /><br />It is large, so be ready for that if you buy it.  The large size can be a good thing if you need large items scanned or want to scan many pics at once.  I am running it on a Win XP computer and the picture scans are gorgeous.  I wish I could comment on the slides as that seems to be the issue for people but I don't have any slides to scan.  But in my homework the reason I wanted this was for the whole 6 color 96 bit scanning and software feature where it can erase out scratches on the pictures, and both work great.<br /><br />The color reproduction on the scans is amazing, a LOT better than the scanner I had before.  Coolest feature for me is because of its large size I can put 4 or 5 pictures on it spread out all over the glass and it will scan them all as individual files.  No idea how it does it but it saves a lot of time as it is a semi-slow scanner.<br /><br />So my breakdown is this:<br /><br />PROS:  Beautiful picture scans with amazing color<br />       Abilty to scan many pictures at once to individual files<br />       Also scans documents great<br />       Quiet<br />       Easy setup and zero issues for me in Win XP<br /><br />CONS:  Bulky, and scans slowly<br />       Others say not good for slides (I cannot test, no slides)<br /><br />I have had a great experience with it which compelled me to write this review, but looks like the great experience is for users who do not need to scan slides like myself, others may want to look further.<br />

Great Scanner - Ignore negative reviews
I purchased the G4050 to replace my HP 5400c. I read the negatives reviews here but purchased the scanner because of previous experience with HP. The scanner works great. Please do not be put off by the reviews talking about slow scan times. The people complaining are scanning slides or negatives. In one case the person mentioned that it took and long time to scan slides at anything over 1200 dpi.  There is absolutely no need to scan a slide at that high of resolution. You will not get a better quality image than at either 200 to 600 dpi. The scanner scans photos at a very fast speed. It is way faster than my HP 5400c. The software is fine also. The people talking about it not saving settings do not know what they are doing. It is very easy to change the default settings for scans. The scanner has a wonderful feature to "restore faded color". I scan old family photos that have a very bad color cast from fading/old film deteration. The restore faded color feature works well. On some photos I had to do a little additional editing with photoshop elements but you could get by with just the scanner fix if you are not into editing. I would highly recommend this scanner.

Production!! ...and here's a Vista fix as well
This is the third scanner I have purchased. I have thousands of slides from my travels over the last 40 years and I wanted to digitize them. The other two were single feeds and I didn't have the patience to sit there and wait for it to scan.<br /><br />But this scanner is great. I think the resulting pics are quite good. You can do 16 at a time. People who are complaining about the scans being too blue, etc., are not taking the time to actually learn how to use it.<br /><br />You load the slides. Then do some basic edits for each slide. Then you sit back and let it run. I do it while watching  TV. <br /><br />I've been using the default 300 ppi and for my purposes it is just fine. If it is really a great pic then I up it to 600.<br /><br />Note: for those who had trouble installing in Vista - here's the fix. As usual, the HP tech staff had no clue. <br /><br />The scanner program is still looking for flash.ocx despite the fact that the world has moved on. <br /><br />You probably have flash9.ocx or something like that. So you need to MAKE A COPY AND RENAME IT flash.ocx in the right folder. <br /><br />Directions as follows.<br /><br />Go to Windows>System32>Macromed>Flash and copy flash9.ocx. Might be flash8 or flash who knows, any of them should work. Paste it back into the SAME directory and change the COPIED file to flash.ocx. <br /><br />Do not delete your flash8 or flash9.ocx. Other programs are using it.<br /><br />Restart your computer. Should fix it. <br /><br />Good idea to do this before you try installing the HP scanner software. I installed and uninstalled mine three times before I found this fix on the internet.<br /><br />------Update May 8 - the more I use this scanner the more I like it. I usually scan 2 or 3 batches a day. My backlog is actually diminishing. Doing a great job.<br /><br />------Update August 13, 2009. Have scanned in approx 3,000 plus slides and really appreciate this scanner. I leave all the settings neutral except I do have the dust/scratch remover set to on. Still using 300. Tried higher settings but just takes longer and produces much fatter files. Don't see that much difference at the sizes I am viewing. <br /><br />I bought Adobe Lightroom and I find that to be a very good tool to organize and do simple sizing, cropping, etc. If you have PS/Elements you can easily pop over into that for more chopping. If you aren't really into photography then Google's freebie Picasa is quite good and very easy to use.<br /><br />**********Feb 15, 2010. *****************Owners read this.<br />HP has new scanning software available on their website. Freebie. Well worth the time. Does a much better job of finding and outlining the slides. Almost 100% which is a big improvement. 10000% better at doing pre-editing.  You don't have to click in and out of each slide which was so time consuming. Now they show the pics in a slider and you can click on one, fix it, and go onto the next. Saves a lot of time because you get a nice big pic to look at and you tweak it, or you can decide to not bother with the scan. Some very nice systems work there. Makes this even more desirable. I'm using Windows7 and no install problems like before. Maybe they read this review. ;)<br /><br />Update on new sw: warning. Be careful when using the "remove dust and scratches" function. It can erase eyebrows and other facial features. I quit using it. Still, the new sw is great and really decreases the time it takes to process your slides.<br /><br />

Great slide scanner
After reading all of the reviews I was a bit worried about the ease of scanning slides with this unit.  I am totally happy with it!  I have easily scanned 100+ slides in a very short period of time.  The template that holds the slides in place sits directly on the scanner's glass.  Then you just lay the slides in it- very easy!  I have the default setting at a very low resolution to get many slides scanned quickly-  I can't believe how true to color and clarity I'm getting!!  It takes about 5 minutes to scan 16 slides, cataloging is very easy with the software.<br />So, go get this scanner and bring back to life the great old slide photos hidden away in your boxes!

Glad I bought
Arrived Non-operational, HP tech support sent replacement unit next day. Scans photos as good as originals, 16 slides at a time and negatives. All in separate jpeg files. Photo fixes as it scans to correct many defects and faded pictures. Converts 16 slides with excellent resolution in under 8 minutes.

Great for Document Scanning
I bought the HP Scanjet G4050 as a replacement for my HP4370 Scanjet, which I had worn out after 2 years of heavy use scanning in books and documents. Most of the reviews did not relate to my primary application, which is scanning text into MS-Word documents.<br /><br />I have been using the G4050 now for about a month, and am extremely pleased with the results. The software works pretty much the same as what I was already used to. And so far as speed (something criticized by some of the other reviewers), I find the speed more than adequate, being two to four times faster than my old scanner.<br /><br />This is a quality product, and the few pictures that I have scanned also come out nicely. I recommend the HP-G4050 to any who have a need for high-volume photo or document scanning.

Best of Breed for Mac!
I received an advance-release of this product at WWDC08 in June 2008, and I've been playing with it ever since. It is top notch in every regard. The hardware is small and only uses the USB port [no need to find an A/C plug!]. The software is even better, as it grabs data right from the scanned receipt; no need for retyping in most cases! <br /><br />This is a high quality product, and feels like something Apple has made, as even the packaging is tidy and well organized. <br /><br />I highly recommend this over the currently offered shareware solutions. The software is really top notch, and the scanner is portable enough to fit in a laptop bag easily.

Great Scanner
This is the third different make of scanner I have purchased and for the purpose of records keeping it is the best.  It is fairly accurate in reading and placement of my required data.  Since I have had it 2-weeks, there have been several updates and improvements in the operations that you can choose to do.  I would recommend this to any Mac person who wishes to be able to quickly log and retrieve information from their documents or receipts.

Neat Receipts - the best organizer ever!
I've had a Neat Receipts organizer for PC for 4 years and absolutely love it. My dad has a Mac and has wanted to use a program like NR so I was thrilled to find they now make one for Mac. The software loads easily, great tutorials, and works immediately. The product is reliable, easy to use, and a time saver. There is a learning curve b/w the PC and Mac version if you have used the PC version. The document scanner makes emailing documents an option so that a fax machine is not necessary. The money and time it saves on taxes pays for itself the first year. The Mac version has fewer capabilities than the PC version, but that will change ~ Neat Receipts is great about updating the program to expand its functions.

After various attempts to tame the mounds of paper that threaten to engulf my office, this package has the best chance. The scanner is a thing of beauty in itself. The software is very, very stable (Readiris take note) very cocoa yummy, mac OSX friendly. There is a capability to produce SEARCHABLE standalone OCR/image pdfs independent OR file within the neat office ecosystem, which is excellently designed, and probably the best way to manage receipts. <br /><br />In truth, the OCR is only about as good as anyone else's, so that means that receipt or business card scanning still requires quite a lot of hands on manipulation. That said, its stable (did I mention that?), the data management is elegant, receipt scanning/analysis is still reasonably efficient, and I've been able to pressgang my 12YO into handling it.. in lieu of her running wild with my itunes account. <br /><br />Neat appear to have a commitment to upgrading the software - my WISHLIST for future development includes: <br />Evernote integration (I'm sure they are working this as I write)<br />Batch applicable editing (eg Tags, categorization etc<br />Tonal adjustment of scans (to reduce background noise and cruft)<br />TWAIN for third party image photoshoppery (assuming this doesn't exist somewhere already)<br />Generally smarter OCR. <br /><br />But all in all, this (after a seriously disappointing experience with IRiScan and Readiris), is the first practical solution I've experienced. Incoming paperwork that might be needed is efficiently scanned, OCR'd, and recycled.. (now coming to an egg carton near you).<br /><br />Neat is highly recommended.

Neat Receipts is a great tool for small business.
I would recommend this product to anyone who is running their own business or needs to be able to easily track expenses. The "Print to Neat Works" feature is great for all those receipts for online purchases and the scanner is really quick and has pretty accurate OCR.

An actual Mac application, Not a PORT.
This little receipt scanner is a jewel, but the real jewel is the Software.  The one thing that really angers me is when a company ports the interface of its windows product to its new Mac software.  The result is usually an application that doesn't feel very Mac like and the Mac user is left with a product that seems half finished.  <br /><br />That said, this is NOT what neat has done for the NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner.  The software is very mac like and the Interface is very sleek indeed.  This is one company that seems has embraced the "physics" of the Mac OS which has its own rules and regulations.<br /><br />I bought one of these for work, and I am purchasing one for Home.

A Really useful and easy to use product
The scanner is pretty fast for a small desktop device and produces good scans. The device is portable and connects via usb. The software OCR is pretty accurate. The thing that makes the day is the software. It does a good job of pulling off the fields from the scanned item and placing them into the right place in the built in data base entry. But the thing that really is good is how easy it is to manually update fields or over ride the OCR. Just drag the info into where you want it and edit it for correctness.<br />I am using the MAC version but I assume the PC version works just as well.<br />So it does everything I wanted.

great, easy, seriously recommend for anyone with a pile of crumpled receipts on their desk begging for filing.

Love it!
I love this product.  I read a bunch of reviews on a number of portable scanners and this one rocks.  I use it for scanning receipts and documents and it's so much easier than using my flat bed scanner.  Fast, efficient, I don't have much time to figure out crap (more like I'm impatient) and it just works.

Long Lost Pictures
I've been looking at these for about two years. I've watched the reviews and comments, trying to decide which one was worth the money. When I saw this one that only cost 50 dollars, I decided that was affordable. If it didn't work very well, I wasn't out very much money.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this scanner. I have thousands of slides and negatives that either were never printed as photos or the pictures were lost. I just wanted to see what the negatives looked like, without paying 20 cents a print. Some of these pictures I haven't seen in 30 years.<br /><br />I'm not going to win any photo contests with these pictures, but I'm thrilled to finally see what the pictures are. Plus when printed out, they have a funky vintage look them.

AMAZING PRODUCT!!!
I bought this Negative/Slide Converter for my father. <br />He absolutely loves it!! It is so easy to use and works great!<br />It has really brought our family together, because now we all sit around and look at the computer and share fun stories!<br />He also loves the fact that he can color correct the images and email them to his friends.

Blast from the past!!!!
I got this for my the purpose of giving to my dad so he could get all of the old negatives organized and on digital media.  Being the resident gadget guy in my family, I thought I'd give it a test drive.  Well, what a trip down memory lane.  I have a shoebox filled with old pictures and negatives from high school and college (yes, before digital cameras) and so many of the pictures are missing.  I spent so much time looking at all these old pictures and sending them out to old friends, who I haven't spoken with in some time.  So I got to reconnect as well. Needless to say, I kept the scanner and bought a couple for other family members and friends.  It's one of those things you get for you want to share so others can experience the same kind of nostalgia.  As an added bonus I won't have to rack my brain finding gifts for awhile- this is really one that is a must buy and  great for anyone who has old negatives and a computer.

GREAT!
I have so many negatives that needed to be scanned, a friend told me about this product and it has been on for almost one week straight scanning my pictures.<br />No problems, I am buying this for all my photography friends.<br />Great Product!

Easy slide converter
I bought this slide converter after researching every machine I could possibly find and pricing digitizing my old slides at a variety of camera services.  It was on sale so I decided to try it - I had 15 days to get it to work or return to store.  I fumbled with the install - hard to tell if it was me or not - but finally got it all to work.  When I plug in the USB cable my PhotoImpression Viewer automatically senses a scanner or camera and I can just select the 35mm scanner.  The machine works well, instantly showing the slide or negative.  I can edit or repair any faults in the pictures and save for later use.  I have been wanting a way to conserve old slides that I and my mother have had to put on CDs in order to pass the family pics onto my grandsons.  I was thrilled with this machine. I had tried using small slide viewers and taking pics with my digital camera and found that was best in a dark room, so I figured a slide in a small black box would work and 5megapixels is quite sufficient for the conversions. I can't imagine that anything more expensive would work any better since it amounts to having a small dark room with a light source that transfers the pictures to the computer.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
excellent.
This worked beyond my expectations. I'm very happy about it. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to enjoy their pics or slides. It sure worked well for me.

Great Little Device
This little gadget is wonderful!  I had many slides from the 1960s to convert and this little baby did the job!  It is VERY easy to use and set up.  Just follow the easy directions.  One word of caution - 35mm slide conversions work best - I had a lot of the very old slides that were square with a slim slide frame around them.  The converter only picks up a 35mm size so just be aware if you have the square type slides the top and bottom will be cut off.  It didn't matter to me, as it was just wonderful to digitize these very old parts of my family's photos.  Now that I am done using the converter, I can sell it on ebay....   Its a great tool, and well worth the money I paid.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great
This slide converter works super good. I have been able to take family slides that are over 40 yrs. old and put them on the dvd's for all my siblings to see. Well worth the money. Easy and quick but when you have tons of them it takes time no matter what you do.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Well worth it.
It sounded too good to be true.  It's hard to find a service that will scan negatives for anything resembling a reasonable rate.  Online tutorials I read about scanning negatives all said that decent negative scanners cost hundreds of dollars and were slow to use.<br />So when I got the ION Slides 2 PC scanner, I fully expected it to be yet another piece of cyber junk cluttering up my desk.  I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.<br />It is very easy to install and use.  And it takes up very little space.<br />If you are looking for something that is professional quality, go ahead and keep looking.  If you want something reasonably priced that can give you access to those slides that you've been really meaning to do something with click "add to cart."<br />You won't regret it.<br />
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Perfect for the price and for a novice user
I have only scanned a couple of rolls of 35mm negatives on this unit thus far, but I can already tell that I will be making the effort to dig out all the negatives I can find to scan.  The program included is quite easy to use, and surprisingly offers pretty good editing tools for a novice photo editor (such as myself).<br /><br />Scanning the negatives could not be simpler.  The negatives fit neatly into the tray provided, and all that's left after that is to slide the tray into the unit.  I will say that it does take a bit more time than advertised in the user guide to scan and transfer the images to your PC, but I don't mind, I just thought it worthy of mention.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the image you get is only as good as the negative you have and the camera used to shoot the original image.  That said, the editing tools help to compensate for any brightness and color issues, and allow you to crop out unnecessary background items.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical that this unit would perform as well as I have found that it does, at the low price for which it sells, but I am very pleased.  I am looking forward to digitizing more images, and making CDs for my friends and family.

Awesome Service
First, let me say the merchant I purchased the converter from gave me awesome service. The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.<br /><br />Second, about the converter-we took slides that were over 45 years old and converted them to jpgs to print out. They came out great. <br /><br />I advise anyone who wants to make a memory book for their parents to purchase this this product, especially if they have a parent suffering with altzimers disease or dememtia. We had years and years of slides with great memories for my parents. My mom went through different stages of altzimers before she passed on. But even with the little time we had left with her we made a memory album for her. She would laugh at the memory of the pictures and it helped her remember faces and sometimes other happy things that happened during thoses times.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
It does the job!
I looked into several online options for converting slides to jpeg images. End result and cheapest route was to purchase a scanner and do it myself. I bought this ION scanner and it worked like a charm. Very easy to use after CAREFULLY reading the instructions.  After scanning over 400 slides, I can safely say this was a BIG BANG for my BUCK! I used the ION scanner for slides, but did scan one negative, too.  Make sure you select the proper options for scanning slides or negatives and you're good to go!  Awesome product and solution for my project!

awesome! ^_^
I got this printer to go with my new computer a little over a year and a half ago. I have had absolutely no problems with this printer. It has been very good to me, better than any printer I have ever had. (Best out of 5!) I print alot (papers for schools, pictures, etc.) I still haven't had to change the color ink. And I just changed the black ink not too long ago (which would have lasted longer had I not went through almost two packs of paper last school year printing out mostly essays and short stories for school).  <br /><br />The quality is very very nice. I printed out several pictures when I first got it and they came out very good. Pictures come out best on photo paper but also come out very good on regular paper. <br /><br />The scan option could be better, but it isn't at all bad. The drawback to the scanner is that it can get dusty. You have to make sure it's dust-free or else your scans with come out with dust flakes on it. (It can be easily dusted off.) The other drawback is that it does NOT come with a usb cord (I had to make 2 trips to the store.) So if you get this, make sure you buy a usb cord at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, I love this printer. 5 of my friends also have this printer and they also love it! I love having a printer, scanner, and a copier at my fingertips.

Great for the money!!!
Installing was painless. I don't know why so many people are complaining about the setup. It was super easy. You have to make sure you install the software before you plug the device in. It states this cleary on the instructions.<br /><br />The scanning is very simple to use. I think the quality is very good. Also, the copying is faster than I thought. <br /><br />How nice it is to have everything in one unit! <br /><br />The guy at the store warned me that it didn't come with a USB cable. I would have been very upset if I have got all the way home and I couldn't use it due to HP not including such a vital piece of equipment!<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't read the horror stories on this forum before I bought the 1350. I would have missed out on a great product for a great price.<br /><br />

For the price, best all in one you can find.
I bought this All-in-One when I purchased a digital camera, because I knew I'd be needed advanced printing cabilities and my old printer just wouldn't cut it.  HP had a well-deserved reputation in printing and imaging, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />For the price, I've found the quality to be really what I've come to expect from HP printers.  Colors are sharp, crisp, and the copying quality is above what I'd expect.(it's not for use on mass-quantity copying, but hey, for a single doc or coupla pages, does a fine job)  I do recommend getting a USB cable with it, because the one I purchased did not include that, but that was the only real 'glitch' I found in purchase.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a quality printer at a reasonable price, you can't beat this model.

Excellent Printer/Copier/Scanner
I have an old machine(PIII, 800Mhz, with XP) and the installation was super easy. Follow the instructions, everything works fine.  I think some people are blaming a bad install on their own hardware problems. Scanner software is easy to use and the copier works very well.  I have not yet printed photos with this one but have been impressed with the printing quality of normal documents.  Only gripes, if any, is that this printer is fairly loud and a little on the slow side for printing.  But hey, it's less that $100 and does everything I ask exceeding my expectations. Another thing, this is my 3rd printer (Cannon, Epson) in about 5 years and they never come with the cables so I was not surprised when this one didn't either. <br /><br />Update: crapped out after 2 years.

PSC 1350 - Excellent all-in-one for the price
After our old printer was broken during a move, we had a few objectives for our replacement:<br /><br />1) Photo quality<br />2) Photo memory card slots<br />3) Scan/copy capability<br /><br />After shopping around online I expected to pay $125-$150 for a good device and was pleasantly surprised to find everything I needed for just $100 at Staples.<br /><br />I didn't experience any of the installation problems that others have mentioned. A quick-glance startup sheet was included, and everything went smoothly. I was up and running about 25 minutes after opening the box.<br /><br />I have had the chance to use the product for a couple of months, and have some likes and dislikes:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Photo slots and proof sheet scanning allow for easy direct-from-camera printing.<br />- Photo quality. We have gotten some very good 4x6 images with just the standard color cartridge.<br />- Standalone copier (no need to turn on PC)<br />- Design and footprint. It doesn't take up much space.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's noisy.<br />- There are occasional mishaps with the paper feeder (grabbing two sheets and occasional jamming)<br /><br />In spite of the cons, this machine gets a "5" because it provides so much functionality and quality at such a low price point.<br /><br />This is a great printer for home use.<br /><br />

GREAT PRINTER - FIREWALL PROBLEM
This is a truly wonderful product! But the software can get corrupted or have conflicts and this can cause many hours of woe.<br /><br />Here is a fix to prevent others from going insane: if you are using Zone Alarm and you find yourself unable to print anything from your computer - disable Zone Alarm for 5 seconds and try to print - whether you are successful or not - start Zone Alarm up again. After I printed successfully and started up Zone Alarm again I was still able to print. I run Windows XP Pro.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone else!

Good price, Excellent Quality
I have really become an HP fan as of late.  They have really stepped up their overall quality.  <br /><br />This printer is no exception.  I have had a fairly wide experence with the other brands in the price range.  Nothing beats the HP.  Granted its not a high production machine or a fancy color machine, but for the money it prints my family photos to a quality high enough for me to frame them and put them on my wall.  <br /><br />Combine this printer with the High Gloss premium plus paper, and trust me you cant go wrong.  I am shocked by the quality of prints.<br /><br />For home or small office use, this is hands down the best choice out there.

Printing for pleasure...
My family bought this printer as our epson was slightly ancient. We were all delighted. The printer's 'fast draft' is quick and comes out reasnably clear, the 'normal' and 'fine' modes print pictures with amazing graphical quality. The scanner's resolution is great and will copy the smallest detail. The photocopying device is very simple to use and makes an identical copy of the page in either black or colour. Finally, this HP has a photo editing device that allows you to sharpen, brighten and remove 'red-eye' from any of the photo's on your har disc. This is a simple, user-friendly device that's cheap and reliable. I would advise whoever wants a great printing experince to try it out for themselves.

Great Idea
I bought this last month and so far have scanned in over 1000 pictures from old albums. The automatic picture feeder is so nice you can just drop a stack of pics in and walk away until they are all scanned. Finally a way to get all those old snapshots into digital form. Only occasional feeder jams but easy to fix. Works flawlessly with Windows XP.

A Head Above
I had abandoned Epson years ago and switched to Lexmark printers because of the great "deals" that could be had. I decided to give up on Lexmark because of all the problems I've encountered with their printers. You get what you pay for I suppose. I figured I'd give Epson a chance before going elsewhere and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Initially I was looking at the NX515 because of the Wifi capabilities, but decided the price bump wasn't worth it. I paid somewhere around $60.00 for this machine, and I feel it was worth every penny.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed, which I couldn't find in other AIO printers in the same price range, is separate ink cartridges for each color. The printer takes 4 cartridges, one each for CMKY. Each replacement cartridge costs about $13. While not the cheapest, you still save money in the long run because you don't have to replace all 3 colors at once as you do with a single multi-color cartridge.<br /><br />The scanner is AMAZING to say the least. You can scan up to 4800 DPI which is more than enough for most people. At the highest scan resolution you can see each individual fiber on a sheet of paper! Excellent for making high resolution photos out of regular 4x6 film photos. Print quality is very nice. Faster than most AIO's out there. Photo printing is nice with no graininess or streaks. Edges are crisp and well defined, saturation and color matching is good.<br /><br />Navigational buttons are simple and easy to use. Menus are user friendly. The small LCD screen is a big help ( it adjusts to give a better viewing angle) and turns off after a few minutes of disuse to save energy. Memory card reader is simple to use once you figure out which way they're supposed to go in. You can crop, rotate, and print photos right from the printer and it's surprisingly easy.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it only comes in black! In all it's a cheap printer with some wonderful features that's a perfect companion to any computer.

I love this printer.
I bought this printer to replace an old HP printer that was giving me headaches.<br />I couldn't be happier; the setup program is the greatest installation wizard I've seen in a while for a printer: It takes you step by step, with crisp and clear illustrations, through the whole process of unpacking the printer, installing the cartridges and getting the wireless working. <br />I was especially concerned about the wireless, the installation process had to deal with my Windows Vista, my router, my network security settings, my antivirus and my firewall ... I was expecting some trouble but it just worked seamlessly.<br />I was so happy I even registered the printer with Lexmark, which apparently gives you ink discounts.<br />Printing quality is great so far but I've only printed business documents, I'll update this review after I print some pictures.<br />

Beautiful, precise, cheap! (No doublesided printing)
We bought this at Circuit City for 69 dollars.  We don't need fax, so this suited our needs, plus its smaller than its HP competitive printers.<br /><br />The wireless was a snap to configure.  I recommend this printer.<br /><br />WARNING:  This Printer does not double side print automatically.  I initially purchased this product because Circuit City had a sign on it that said "Doubleside Printing", now I see it doesn't.  However, I see that I probably don't need this option, so I'm sticking with it.

SUPERB CUSTOMER SUPPORT
I purchased this Lexmark printer after researching it thoroughly on the internet and paying attention to the reviews by customers.  I received it, followed the set up instructions and in spite of how easy it is to set up, I must have done something wrong.  HERE'S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD.  I call Lexmark, am speaking with a customer service rep within two minutes, and she establishes a remote access to my computer, goes in and diagnoses the problem, uninstalls the software and reinstalls it correctly.  Unbelievable.  I have never experienced such excellent help from any technology company.  Especially computer equipment companies.<br />When she got done, it worked perfectly.  This makes so much sense I don't know why other corporations don't do this.  I put up with crappy HP printers for years.  Never again.

pleased in NC
Purchased this wireless printer 8 months ago at Circuit City as a part of a computer package. Although I paid next to nothing for this because of the package, I have been well pleased. It was a breeze setting up wirelessly and have no issues accessing it with my XP desktop nor my Vista laptop using a secured wireless router. <br /><br />It doesn't use a ton of ink, like some of my other prints do. I also own a HP as well as a Canon. I would take this one anyday. <br /><br />The only con I have is that living in a remote area, there are not a ton of choices to find the cartridges locally. I do get a discount with lexmark to order them since I registered the printer. <br /><br />Was surprised that it scans in color as well as copies in color. Scans and copies are clean and I was impressed that this little printer was that advanced.<br /><br />It is used at home on a daily basis. I have had absolutely no issues with this printer, not even a paper jam. <br /><br />Now son is heading off to college in August and taking this with him. We like it so much, we will purchase another to keep ourselves. <br /><br />Why did I post this now.....price checking to purchase again!<br /><br />

Quick, Easy and Affordable!!
When this printer arrived I thought 'OK this is going to require some time to deal with all the network headaches'.  So I put the disk in the drive, followed the extremely easy instructions, and everything was done in about 2 minutes!  (I almost think an illiterate could follow the pictures and get the job done)  It literally took longer to unpack the printer from the box, than it did to set it up.   A great bargain too!  It works great! Even the guy at my local Best Buy recommended Lexmark, but said they don't carry them.  Now I know why he likes them.

technophobe dream
When our old dell died, our kids gave us a lenovo S10.  We loved it and decided not to get a new desktop, but we needed a printer.  Ordered this one, which arrived in record time.  Included directions were sparse and we can't install a disk on our lenovo, so we went to the web site and downloaded directions-and they worked. That's it, folks-they worked, and that's all I want from a product, to do what it says without my having to take a course to figure it out.  I feel like a genius (ok, I'm really bad at computers but I'm getting  better every day) because a product did what it said-I wish all transactions were this easy.

Love my Lexmark Wireless Printer
I had just recently purchased a new HP laptop computer and needed to get a wireless printer. My daughter has had a Lexmark printer and told me how much she liked it. I checked various wireless Printers and found that the Lexmark that I purchased was a great price. so I decided that a Lexmark printer would be my next printer. THe Ink cartridges are also alot cheaper than other ink cartridges.   I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.

Just What The Doctor Ordered. Great Value!
Top 6 Things You Need To Know About Me And This Printer<br /><br />1.  Was an upgrade from a old $30.00 HP printer that I had forever. Was only interested in a printer that gets the job done as inexpensively and problem-free as possible.<br />2.  Found it on sale for $59.99 (from $89.99) at Target.<br />3.  Does everything well, but can't really compare it with more expensive models because I've never owned any.<br />4.  Had issue with old Lexmark CD supplied software not being compatible with my up-to-date Apple Snow Leopard operating system. Called customer support number (800-539-6275) and the service agent take over my computer and download the most current Lexmark/Mac software directly to my computer.  About a 10 minute wait to get a live representative, but otherwise it was as easy as customer service gets.<br />5. Joined the Lexmark Rewards Program where you can receive 1 cartridge free for every 5 you buy AND you get another free cartridge when you return 5 used cartridges.  Prices for cartridges through Lexmark are comparable with Target's prices.  Seems like a no brainer.<br />6.  I use it wirelessly and through a cable to my desktop.  With the exception of the issues stated in #4, the Lexmark Assist Program was easy to follow for both my laptop and desktop.<br /><br />Lastly, a public service announcement:  Regardless of website, I find these customer reviews invaluable and never make a purchase without referring to them.  I encourage everyone to take a moment, jot down your experiences and help the rest us make smarter purchase in the future.  Thank you for indulging me.

Initial Reaction: Easy to Use
I just purchased and set up this printer several hours ago. Being on a Mac (OS 10.4.7), I found set up occurred easily and quickly. First, I followed the 14-step "Start Here" poster. Once the software was loaded, it transferred from CD and ran through its installation application quickly (about 10 minutes).<br /><br />In my set-up, the C4180 is connected by USB cable to a G5 iMac. I also have a G4 PowerBook and both machines are connected by wireless network. Copying, scanning and printing from the iMac was successful. But to print over the wireless network required that I activate Printer Sharing from the Internet & Network > Sharing preferences (accessed from the System Preferences). Once this was done on the iMac, the C4180 showed up as a printer on the remote PowerBook.<br /><br />One hitch occurred during scanning. I placed a map on the glass and used HP's Photosmart Studio to control the scan settings. I set the scan to 200 dpi and enlarged the preview frame to scan the whole image. After clicking OK a warning came up that I didn't have enough memory to complete the task (I had 1.5 GB of RAM and no other software running). So I brought up Photoshop and controlled the scan from there. No problems (and the scan completed at 200 dpi). I'll have to return to Photosmart Studio and dig into how it works. <br /><br />For ease of set-up and immediate gratification, this printer fulfills my needs and meets my expectations perfectly.

Well Done HP
Just bought mine yesterday, set up was quick, easy, no glitches no problems, it was so obvious what to do with it, read on instructions later.<br />HP has done a great job with this printer at a very reasonable price, my first attempts at printing photos were just great,very happy with this printer, I think at any price its hards to beat.<br />Tried scanning and then scanning and printing, all very successful.<br />Only negative I have is that HP does not give you full ink tanks with their printers, its a bit more than a sample, but, ok, the printer is so good, I accept it.<br />Their method of using another cartridge for printing 4 x 6 prints fits neatly on the side and is unseen,yet, works so well when pluged into the printer.<br />A top printer at a great price.

HP All in One
I looked for a while for something affordable but good.  I picked this one based on reviews.  I like this printer.  It is fast and does a good job. The only thing I don't like is that it it sounds like a cheap printer as it makes noise when it prints (like the plastic shakes), but otherwise for the money, it is excellent.  It was easy to set up also.

high quality, affordable
I purchased a C4180 after my previous printer suddenly ceased all functioning - the day before a large research paper was due! I was impressed immediately by how easy setup for this printer was, as well as with all the options it provides controls for directly on the printer. The speed of printing was lightning-fast, and I was thrilled.<br />Unfortunately, I did run into problems - my photos printed in strange shades of purple (even when I set the print settings to black and white and to print in grayscale only!), the unit started to issue "paper jam" messages every time it was turned on, and shortly after it stopped printing altogether - the print cartridges were strangely stuck on one side of the printer, and no longer returned to their "home" position. I contacted HP's Customer Service via e-mail, described the problems in detail, and recieved suggestions promptly on how to possibly solve it. A few days after that, I recieved a follow-up e-mail, inquiring as to whether the strategies had worked. Although the suggestions unfortunately had not, because of the warranty HP provides on all of their products, they shipped me a different printer (same model) within about 5 days. This printer arrived with a prepaid shipping label so that I would not have to incur charges in mailing my own printer back to them as a return. I have been very satisfied with that C4180, and friends and family members are amazed at the quality with which photos print. Although yes, I did have some problems with my original C4180, I am giving this product five stars for the affordability, quality, and excellent customer service HP provides for their customers.

Great Printer
I hooked this printer up to an HP desktop that runs on Vista software.  Instalation was easy.  I just plugged the USB cable in and the Computer did all the proper installations by itself.   Ive had this printer for about 6 months and really have no complaint.  It is fast, quiet and very reliable in all its functions.

A+++++++  All-in-One HP J4550
I just bought this printer [today] and made some sample prints and they are really good. <br />Couple of Positives :<br />1. You may just load the black ink cartridge and the printer will print in black & white/gray. In my opinion this is by far the best feature. In my normal use 80% of the prints are documents which need only gray scale prints. My earlier Epson and HP photosmart would not print unless all the cartridges were plugged-in. That to me is ink drain. As the color cartridges would eventually dry up and need replacement just to satisfy the printer's desire for color ink.<br />2. Copy setting for Lighter/Darker copy: I'm not sure if other reviewers noticed that there is a setting on the front-panel in copy mode to adjust the darkness of copy. changing this to lighter mode will save some ink ; I've yet to see how many prints i get per cartridge.<br />3. Super fast prints : Who said the printer is slow. There are 3 modes in printing [Fast Draft, Normal & Best]. I have never used normal unless i'm printing photos or sales brochure. The Fast Draft is excellent for all purposes. Its sharp at the same time more than adequately dark. The normal mode is marginally more darker [and yes will take more ink too]. So unless you are printing Engg design or blue prints or sales material or graphics, i dont see why you would ever go for "Normal" mode.<br />4. Paper tray : i could see why you could get paper crammed up at corners, only if you have folds or turns on the paper to begin with. I havent experienced it.<br />5. The solution center software is very customizable. Let me first say this, this step is completely optional and if you have sometime on hand do customize it, it takes a little while to set the preferences if you want to make your life easier for the rest of your use. However you DONT have to customize it, it has prebuilt shortcuts for scanner usage[Scan to PDF, Scan to Word for Editing, Scan to Picture] and can be used right away after installation. You can set the scan resolution for every type of scanning requirement.<br />6. The optical character recognition is good with aplha-numeric text documents.<br /><br />The Downside :<br />1. The LCD panel is 1 line display and is not backlit, hence hard to read unless you are directly infront of the printer. My printer is placed on the left side of the desk, so have to strech (good workout though:)<br />2. I agree Scanning takes a tad bit longer than printing, but thats cuz i have set the scan resolution at 600dpi, if you set it to default 300dpi, it would be twice as fast i assume.<br />3. Would have loved to have duplex [double sided printing] capability.<br />4. I find it little odd that the back portion of the print mechanism is a little exposed. Not that its a concern, just wondering from dust point of view.

Great Printer Very Realiable Works With 7 RC!
I bought this printer and it has printed a semester full of essays, research papers, photos, and much more. The OCR (text recognition) is excellent for when you need to edit a printed document, it was a lifesaver when I lost my flash drive with my 20 page research paper on it! Great for faxing transcripts off to colleges too! I never had a problem with the printer and there was no damaged pages as in other reviews. In fact, I recommend this printer to random people in Wal-Mart!

I bought this printer/fax/scanner about two weeks ago and love it. It has all the features I need and they all work well. I was hesitant because the price was so good and was pleasantly surprised with how quick the set-up was and the control I have over the printing and scanning.<br /><br />If you need a very decent printer/fax/scanner this one can't be beat. I got mine at Costco for $59.<br /><br />

I've had this printer for a little over a year now and I love it. Being a college study I print several pages off every week, and usually multiple pages every day. I've never had any problems with it at all. The quality is great for every single page the printer prints, black and white or color. Not only is the quality great, but the speed of the printer is great as well.

Great Product
I've been in the fitness industry for over 10 years and have always been leary about buying a "cheap" home machine. This treadmill works great for home use. I was thoroughly impressed. I'm 230lbs and I can run on it with no problems! Great machine for the money!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Love it!!!
I'm really happy with this treadmill.  I can't tell the difference between this one and much more expensive models.  It has preset routines, automated incline, pulse monitor, a cup holder.  It's sturdy to walk on and absorbs impact for a cushy run.  Runs smoothly and quietly.  And has a lifetime warranty.  And free shipping!  <br />  <br /><br />
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Perfect!
My husband and have been using this machine for about a month now and are still in love with it.  The cup holders are great and the book ledge doubles as an ipod holder.  I'll admit we haven't done any of the routine maintenance as the book told us to do.  But, the machine doesn't seem to mind.  I absolutely recommend this treadmill and I am a very, very picky person :)

Great treadmill
I love this treadmill. It was delivered very quickly. I was able to assemble it with only some minor help, and I don't have a mechanical bone in my body. The treadmill itself works well. I didn't know much about them, but it's very user friendly. I highly recommend it.

They must have made improvements
We purchased the Merit 725T treadmill from Amazon after reading the reviews and decided that the pros outweighed the cons and that this was great for our budget.  Upon arrival I was ready for the worst, as far as assembly, and decided to time how long it would take to put together.  From the moment that I cut the straps on the box to the moment that I turned the machine on was 20 minutes flat.  There were only 4 pages of directions to follow and roughly 20 screws/bolts to put in.  While I used my own tools, this machine comes with the required phillips screwdriver and alan wrench that fit all of the screws/bolts.  One thing that we were unable to find while researching the treadmill were the measurements when assembled and when folded.  They are as follows: 68" long (wall to end)  31" at the widest point 53" at the highest point.  When folded: 35"(wall to furthest point 31" at the widest point 54.5" at the highest point.  <br />We have only had the treadmill in the house for a few hours, but it has been used three times already for roughly 30 minute periods, and the noise that some complained of is not an issue at all.  During the first use I called my wife to let her know that it was up and running and she asked if it was loud.  I was walking using the 4 mph setting and she could not hear it running in the background.  I will add to this that we have the treadmill on a carpeted floor and tile or hardwood would certainly make a difference.  I will post pictures soon.

Perfect fit
To assemble this product, I recommend using a different tool from the one they supply to screw in the bolts.  Theirs DOES NOT WORK. I cannot emphasize this enough. Once I realized this, it was a breeze to assemble and the treadmill works great!!  It's easy to operate, sturdy, has lots of functions and settings. I like that it has a secure place to hold a drink and other things such as an IPod.  It's fairly quiet too.  I belonged to a gym and recently quit.  I would compare the quality of this treadmill to any commercial gym quality treadmill for sure.

excellent choice and easy to put together
I am over 60 and needed a treadmill to walk inside since it is so hot in Texas.  I shopped around at the local sports stores, figured what options I wanted and then went to the internet landing on Amazon.  The price was the best since I did not have to pay sales tax or shipping.  The local store was going to charge me $40 delivery.  I read the reviews and was skeptical about the putting together process.  I called my son who was the "put it togetherer" and he read the reviews and said "looks like most are satisfied, go ahead and order it."  I am very happy I did.  Son put it together in a little over an hour and his only complaint was he "wished they had pre-oiled".   It is not a heavy duty piece of equipment (250 # use capacity) but for me who likes to walk two 45 minute stretches a day it is perfect.  Very easy to operate.  It is fun.

Great Treadmill, Great Price
We received this treadmill about one month ago, and have used it nearly every day since then for light jogging (6-7 mph).<br />It arrived in good time, and set-up was very simple. Balancing the belt took a bit of fine-tuning, but was not a problem. My wife and I are very happy with the price we paid for this machine. It is a steal for the price we paid ($399), and we highly recommend it!

2 thumbs up!!
I really love this treadmill.  The "interval" setting is the best. After 2 weeks there is a difference in my britches....LOVE IT!!  I bought the machine on the advice of a physical therapist because of a bad back AND I'm truly happy I made the purchase!  Easy to put together.  I can't say enough good things about this product.

Great for home use
I wanted a treadmill - my husband bought me an elliptical stepper.  That would be great if I didn't have equilibrium issues.  After he bought that, I felt guilty spending too much $ on a treadmill and found this one.  It works great for me.  I can walk different "courses" and keep my water right there.  Great handles for me to hang on to and an emergency stop cord if you "fall off" (a possibility for me).  I paid much less than Amazon has this listed for now, and got free, fast shipping.  I don't run on it, just walk fast, but, it really fits my needs.  Great buy for the money.

Merit Fitness 725T - Fantastic In-home Machine
Other than multiple delivery problems - The machine is great. It took little more than an hour to unpack and assemble.Parts fit well with no surprises. Use a GOOD Phillips Screwdriver and follow the instruction book (easy to read-good pictures) We are 72 yr old seniors so this machine is perfect with it's 7 programs and many manual capabilities. Be careful, some of the programmed workouts may be too much for some people (LIKE US). Sturdy and well built as it is, I don't believe it is the answer for a young athlete but for anyone wanting a general purpose machine,this is it. The pulse monitor works well but use a finger monitor for exact numbers.. It's size is perfect for us and the capabilities of the unit( deck width, length, grip heights etc.).Easy to use controls. Easy fold up (not a back breaking process).We put it behind a recliner and leave it open.I have a switched receptacle on the wall next to the unit making it simple to turn on and off. I uploaded pics of it set up in the living room (it is compact). I sincerely recommend this product. For us- a five star unit.

For the price, how can you complain?
I understand the complaints if you received this and it didn't work or if you didn't receive all the correct parts, but it really isn't that difficult to put together, honestly.  Yes, some of the holes were out of line but my fiancee and I managed not only to put it together once, but twice.  This is a rather impressive treadmill for the money, it's huge.  I agree with the other reviewer how it is extremely difficult to move, honestly read the directions...it clearly states to put this treadmill together in the room where you plan to use it, listen to these instructions, obey them, it's true!  We didn't listen.  Also, just a quick note; just because it folds, do not think this will fit under your bed, it won't.  We leave it folded, standing up in our bedroom.  Anyway, we put this monster together in our living room and I wanted in the bedroom since there is more space.  We tried moving it, it was impossible and wouldn't fit through our bedroom door, so we took it apart, put it back together in the bedroom.  Yes, this whole process was frustrating and time consuming, but honestly for this price, you get a well made treadmill that comes with cool training programs, an incline, a heart monitor, 2 cup holders and a safety key!  You can't beat this!

Great Deal!
Great Treadmill. <br /><br />High quality components at a surprising price.<br /><br />Installation took me about an hour, and I had some trouble getting one bolt to fit, but perseverance prevailed and I made it through. Overall a very simple install and I received all of the parts necessary. They didn't include any spares, so hopefully you're not missing anything when it arrives.<br /><br />Heed their warnings about moving the treadmill around before the installation is completed. When you pick it up from the front, the bar can swing forward and hurt you or make you drop it if you're not careful. Take great care if you need to move this thing outside of the box before it's fully assembled.<br /><br />Applying the lubricant at the end was kind of a pain. I don't know why Merit couldn't do this at the factory, but at least it serves as a reminder to lube and shows you how to do it for the next time. (loosen the belt, shove your arm underneath, and squeeze)<br /><br />Pretty quiet for a treadmill. I'm 220lbs and put more strain on the motor than a lighter person, so it may even be quieter for you if you weigh less. It's nice to hear the TV while working out.<br /><br />Cup holders and the electronics are very nice as well. <br /><br />My HOA gym is a 5 minute walk away from my house, but I don't like going there because I don't like working out in public. This purchase has allowed me to work out in my basement for 30 minutes every night after work. Do whatever it takes to make working out convenient for you is my motto, since it is such an easy thing to skip.<br /><br />I've only had this thing for a short time and feel better already. Highly recommended! Overall a great purchase that I would make again in a heartbeat.

Easy to set up and use
I've had no problem setting this up; the only help I needed was for someone to hold the console in place while I screwed it in (I was afraid I'd drop it and break it). Other than that, it was very simple. It's also incredibly easy to use, which is great for a beginner like me. I didn't even have to read the manual to know how the settings worked (I'd recommend you read the manual anyway, especially when it comes to keeping your treadmill clean and in working condition). An excellent product and nice and cheap, too.

Very Happy with this Treadmill
I have had this treadmill for a few weeks now and have been very happy with it.  It's very sturdy and has a lot of features for a home treadmill.  The comments I list below fall into the category of "just be prepared for" and mainly involve the delivery process.<br /><br />One caveat I have is that this machine is *heavy*.  My delivery guy brought it into my garage and despite my attempts to have him put it just inside a room off the garage, no dice.  I had to have the help of a very strong guy to move the treadmill where I wanted it.  The good news is that after that, it was a piece of cake to put together, involving about 30 big screws and took exactly an hour (probably could have taken even less time).  <br /><br />This treadmill is supposed to fold up, but I can't imagine ever using that feature -- for one, it's too heavy and two, it's so big it's not like you could really hide it anywhere. These are not complaints -- the fact that the machine is big and heavy translates into sturdiness and a larger running surface.<br /><br />Finally, there's no instant gratification when you click the Purchase button online.  Be prepared for this item to take up to a month to be delivered.  It's worth the wait, though!<br /><br />

Great machine
I read consumer reports looking for the best treadmill for someone other than a serious distance runner.  This was the recommended machine.  Its a bit pricey and you do have to do assemble it when it arrives, but its a great machine.  It even has a built in fan.  One caution, make sure to assemble it in the room where you want it to be and don't expect to be able to move it between rooms because when assembled its too wide for standard doorways.

Awesome Machine!
I just recently purchased a Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill off of Amazon.  The other reviews definitely helped me in my decision making process, so I definitely wanted to pass my thoughts along.  I respect Consumer Reports as well, so it was an added plus to find out that they rated this treadmill a top buy.<br /><br />First off, I am very pleased with the overall value.  I received a free Bowflex mat to go underneath it, and also got free super saver shipping.  The Bowflex mat is decent.  I probably would not have purchased it for the $99 price-tag, but it does protect our carpet very nicely, and I'm glad to have it.<br /><br />The thing I was most nervous about was the free super saver shipping.  Other reviewers had mentioned that their boxes arrived in very poor condition, so I didn't know what to expect.  Thankfully, my treadmill box arrived in excellent condition.  One guy delivered it, and he had quite the time getting it off the truck.  He did a great job, though, and nothing was damaged in any way.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this is one HEAVY machine.  It took me (a 200 pound guy), a strong friend, and my wife to lift the thing into our house.<br /><br />Once the machine was in place, setup was a breeze.  Probably took me 45 minutes to an hour, and everything was pretty self explanatory.  The instructions were very easy to follow.  Probably one of the easiest assembly projects I have ever encountered.<br /><br />I have already had the opportunity to run on this machine a couple times, and it is even better than expected.  Although the machine is very heavy, which makes for an interesting time getting it into the house, I believe the weight also makes it an extremely sturdy machine.  I am a 200 pound guy, and the machine has no trouble handling me when I run.  It is very smooth, reasonably quiet, and the 3.0 horsepower motor has no trouble handling inclines or running.  I have had health club memberships in the past, and this machine is as good, if not better, than some of the "commercial quality" machines I have used.<br /><br />Also, the 20"x60" deck provides ample running space.  The two-ply belt looks thick, and does not appear to be something that will wear out any time soon.  The deck also folds up and drops down very easily, with minimal assistance needed.  <br /><br />Here's the stuff that is so-so:<br /><br />Don't expect the fan to do much.  You do notice a difference if you have the fan on high, and then you turn it off.  At most, it provides a very light breeze on your face.  <br /><br />As one other reviewer noted, the grip heart-rate monitor seems to take a very long time to provide a reading.  I haven't had a chance to use the wireless monitor yet, but it seems like that has received very positive reviews.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that his belt was off center when he received the machine.  My belt was a tad off center as well, but it is very easy to make the needed adjustment to get it centered again.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that I wish the treadmill had a warranty that would rival Smooth Fitness.  I was close to purchasing the Smooth 6.25, but the Bowflex Series 7 was slightly less money, and I felt it offered more features.  That said, the Smooth 6.25 has an unbelievable warranty that Bowflex cannot match.  Nothing about the Bowflex Series 7 leads me to believe that it will be anything but a great machine for years to come, but I do wish it had a longer warranty.<br /><br />Overall, the Bowflex Series 7 appears to be an awesome machine, and hopefully it proves to be a workhorse that can standup to years of use.

My heart is stronger now.
We've all heard the old Lakota Indian quote, "let me never judge another until I have walked 1000 miles in his moccasins."  Well, I didn't want to judge this product until I had run 100 miles on its treads.  Now that I've completed 100+ miles I can provide a review.  <br />I've seen a lot of complaints about delivery.  None here.  Eagle put it right where we asked.  I was at work when it was delivered but my wife asked them to bring it around the back of the house, down the steps into the basement and into it's permanent location.  And that's what the delivery guys did.  No problem.<br />Assembly was a breeze.  I put it together in under an hour with my two young kids running around jumping on the box and asking questions the entire time.  If you can follow simple instructions you can do this.<br />I wouldn't call it a space-saver since it takes a lot of space even when it's folded, but it's a big treadmill.  What do you expect?  It is maneuverable though.  Lock it in the upright position, lean it back on its wheels and away you go.<br />This is a great product.  The cushioned platform means my knees and feet do NOT hurt after running.  If I run outside I'm in pain for at least the next day.<br />It runs quietly (although I do NOT).  <br />The soft-landing feature when you lower it is a very nice touch.  <br />The multiple running programs are great.  I've used a few of them but for now I've settled on the run/walk program.  A few minutes of running, half those minutes of walking, more running, more walking, etc..  When my heart rate gets down to where I want it during the walk phase, I like that I can override the speed setting and crank it back up to my running pace.  So, you don't have to walk three full minutes after you've just run for six.  If you're ready to hit it after one minute of walking you can.<br />I've used the incline a couple times.  It works perfectly, but right now I'm focusing on getting my endurance where I want it to be.  For me that means no incline, just 60 minutes of running and increasing the pace until I can start hitting my mileage goal consistently.<br />The heart rate handles are useless.  I'm not sure if it's possible to make them work correctly but what's the point?  You shouldn't be reaching out and grabbing those anyway.  Why break your pace?  The Polar heart monitor that comes with the treadmill is all you need.  In fact, you shouldn't run without it.  It's been interesting to see how, as I steadily increase my running distance, my heart has grown stronger.  This is measurable with the output provided by the heart monitor.  Amazing.<br />Everyone complains about the fan.  Yep, I'll confirm that.  The fan is weak.  It might as well not be there.  But, I didn't buy this thing for the fan.  If it can generate any breeze at all, that's just a bonus.<br />Consider me one very satisfied customer.  Also consider me a healthier customer than I was before I began using this fine piece of equipment.

So far, so good.  Great machine.
I ordered the Bowflex Series 7 on 9/6/06.  It was delivered via Eagle on 9/21/06.  It was available for delivery on the 20th, but I wasn't able to receive it on that date.<br /><br />The review from Consumer Reports and reviews here at Amazon was the deciding factor for my purchase.  So far I am extremely happy with the treadmill.  The only drawback that I can see is the heart rate monitor on the machine.  It takes a LONG time to read the heart rate.  It's practically useless.  However, the package came with a remote monitor that works excellent.  <br /><br />Warning:  The delivery.  There was one guy who delivered the machine.  A middle aged, strong man.  But he really struggled with the thing.  There should have been two men.  I saw the box as it came off the truck and it was really beat up.  And then with the one guy struggling with it, as he was getting the thing off the dolly in my garage, it came down hard on the floor.  So here I am with a box that looks pretty beat up, and it hits hard on my garage floor.  I worry about the delicate computer parts of the machine.  I immediately contacted Amazon.  They said if there was any problem, there is of course the return policy.  Not sure how it would be returned if needed, as the box has to be pretty much demolished to get the thing completely out for assembly.  But, so far, so good. <br /><br />As you can see from my above paragraph, the machine is very heavy.  I was able to bring in all parts  except for the biggest part... the deck.  My husband and two others really had to muscle that thing in.  Yes, it can be folded and rolled, but not to get into my house and through hallways and doorways.  Folded, it won't work.  It was quite a job.  Once the unit was where it needed to be, the assembly was a snap.  <br /><br />Like I said, so far so good.  It is working great.  I really like the machine.  Just as good as the ones I've used at the gyms.  I hope this will continue for a long time to come.

Don't forget the CALIBRATION step!
I have never written a review for any product, ever, but here is my first attempt.<br /><br />About 18 years ago, I bought my wife an el-cheapo treadmill from Montgomery Wards for around $500, thinking that she would probably use it for a couple of months and then it would gather dust and eventually be donated to Goodwill. To my astonishment, she ran on that thing for at least an hour, 3 to 5 days a week right up until last month when the deck finally fell apart and the belt began to shred. If I could have simply bought that treadmill again, I would have, but since that wasn't possible, I decided at least to get my wife a higher-end treadmill to replace it.<br /><br />The first challenge was to narrow down my choices. Since Consumer Reports and the Treadmill Doctor website both rated this model highly, I was torn between it and models from Sole and Bodyguard, but a quick internet search revealed a (since ended) Amazon "secret sale" on the Bowflex models that lopped hundreds of dollars off the final price of the Bowflex, so that clinched my decision to get the Series 7.<br /><br />A few days after I ordered it, the Eagle truck backed into my driveway, and a nice old (60+) guy began wrestling to get the huge, heavy box off the truck. He refused to let me help, and eventually got it tipped off the truck and onto a dolly without killing himself, or losing control of it. I didn't want him to risk injury trying to get it up my 2 porch steps and over my threshold though, so I just let him wheel it 10 feet into my garage and we eased it to the floor there.<br /><br />The box was pristine, as was the treadmill itself, and it only took 4 guys to haul the deck down my curving stairway and into a basement bedroom.<br /><br />I assembled the unit alone, using the supplied tools and two of my own phillips screw drivers. It was easy to do, and only took about an hour and a half.<br />The assembly instructions are beautifully illustrated and well-written, so you shouldn't have much trouble getting it together.<br /><br />Once I got it assembled and plugged in, I tested it out a little, and everything seemed to work fine. Until I tried to use the INCLINE feature.<br />While it APPEARED to be working well according to the output on the display, the deck stayed flat. Why? Because, although it is not clearly stated in the owner's manual, you MUST do the calibration sequence on page 28 before the incline feature (and who knows what else) will actually work. Fortunately it is an easy procedure, and only takes a minute to do. Another thing the manual should state but doesn't is that you should NEVER use WD-40 to lubricate your belt. According to Nautilus, this is something a lot of people do, and any consequential damage will NOT be covered by your warranty.<br /><br />The Series 7 is easy to operate, FAR quieter than our old treadmill, and was a bargain at the price we paid.

Great for training
I purchased the Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill nine months ago and have used it almost daily. It has held up very well and I have trained for a half marathon, using it as my main source of running since my schedule does not allow me to get outside as much as I would like. I have put on over 800 miles  and its had no problems at all. My one disapointment was with the fan. It is not as strong as I would like. This treadmill is also difficult to move around as its very heavy. However, this is a great treadmill, well built and made to last. It was well worth every penny!

Only Five stars because a Ten is not offered!
After reading a consumer mag. and all the reviews on Amazon I ordered the Bowflex 7. What is written is so! After a month of daily use I would buy it again in a heartbeat! Powerful motor, quiet operation, very stable, simple controls, great cardio belt, and easy to fold. The delivery was textbook - called in advance, arrived as promised, and put it on the spot I requested (with my assistance)!<br />

AMAZING
This treadmill is a "MUST HAVE". The ordering and delivery process was smooth. I received my treadmill within two weeks. I was clearly informed regarding delivery time. Set up was simple. It took my Son and his girlfriend 45 minutes. This is a sturdy and durable piece of equiptment. We are big, tall people and the track length and size really accomodates us and does facilitate a GREAT WORKOUT! This is the 4th treadmill I have puchased and by far the best. I am amazed at how quiet this machine is. I can watch Tv and not have to increase the volume. There are more then enough settings to maximize your workout. I would recommend this treadmill to anyone! Thank you Amazon.Com!!!

great machine, manual changes
I love my treadmill.  I ordered it oct 2, was delivered oct 10.  To reiterate previous posts, this baby is BIG-box brushed against my 8 foot ceilings when the delivery men were wheeling it in.  I don't have stairs, so I could just push it where it needed to go.  The box had a few holes, but nothing hurt inside.  The manual labels and the parts packet labels did not match up for a few things, but was easy enough to figure out what fit and what didn't.  The manual also showed six bolt holes on the arm, but there were only four.  I did not have to calibrate my machine before using the elevation function.  All leads me to believe they may have changed a few things in the last year.  Took about an hour, start to finish, to get it put together.  Very easy, and yes, it can be done by one person (in this case a 5'4" 32 year old woman, completely out of shape;~).<br />The instructions tell you to lubricate every 250 miles, but no indication of where or how to lubricate.  Also written instructions for how to adjust the belt, but no pic.  I still can't find where to put the hex wrench to adjust.  Luckily, the belt is perfect right now, but I know they stretch with use.<br />Other than that, this is a great machine.  INCREDIBLY quiet, if that is important to you.  Very stable.  The deck is super easy to raise and lower.  I love the magnetic safety disc-won't work unless the disc is in place, so even if my three year turns the machine on, she is not going to get caught in anything or shot off the back.<br />I got my mat at Wally World for $20.  Fits fine.<br /><br />Edited 10/17/07<br />Here is the response I received from Bowflex for lubricating the machine:<br />Thank you for contacting Nautilus Customer Care. This machine is<br /> equipped with a pre-lubricated deck and belt system. The deck and belt<br /> friction may affect the function and life of your machine; we recommend<br /> periodic lubrication. We also recommend a periodic inspection of the deck<br /> surface and under the walking belt. To lubricate the belt turn it off and<br /> unplug the machine from the wall outlet, also remove the power cord.<br /> Gently lift each side of the machine's belt and apply a small amount of<br /> the silicone based lubricant directly onto each belt while they are<br /> warm (not hot). Plug the fitness machine back into the machine base and<br /> then into wall outlet. Stand to the side of your machine and not on the<br /> belts themselves. Turn on your machine, and start the belts at the<br /> slowest speed. Let the belts run for approximately 15 seconds. Turn off your<br /> fitness machine. And repeat all steps again. Then take care to wipe up<br /> any excess silicone lubricant from the deck surface area. We recommend<br /> that you only use Silicone Spray, available at most Hardware and Auto<br /> Parts stores. If you decide to purchase this lubricant at an Auto Parts<br /> store, Napa Auto parts has a brand called NAPA 8300 that will work<br /> very well. If you have any further questions or concerns regarding the<br /> lubrication of your belts please contact us at 1-800-782-4799.

Bowflex Series 7 ROCKS!
After looking at several treadmills in our local fitness store and online, I took a look at the recent Consumer Reports magazine which rated fitness equipment (February 2006).  The Bowflex Series 7 was rated at the top of the folding choices, as well as being awarded a "Best Buy" rating.  This was the only one of the folding models that had an "excellent" quality rating.  Thus, my choice was made.<br /><br />I ordered this treadmill through Amazon.com and the process was outstanding.  The treadmill arrived via a freight company and I found out it is one heavy beast.  My neighbor and I had to slide it into the house, down the stairs into the exercise area (no way could two people even lift this).  The parts were all packaged very securely and the instructions were quite good, with clear instructions on assembly and photos.  Parts are labeled with "stickies" that have corrisponding letters, which aids in assembly.  Assembly was painless, although the little allen wrenches that are provided are of marginal use (I used my mechanic's set).  Did I mention this this is heavy??  The Bowflex parts are all heavy (with nice welded seams) tube or square bar steel, not thin tube steel or aluminum, as is common on Wal-Mart style or inexpensive treadmills.<br /><br />In use, this thing can take a beating.  The heavy gauge frame can withstand running (yes, running/jogging) from a grown adult male (rated up to 300 lbs.).  I have seen friends have their treadmill's deck flex or even warp under their weight, but the Bowflex is solid (after two months of every day use).  The heart rate chest strap is a plus, as well as the different programs that are available.  Very solid, large deck and quality make this a great treadmill.<br /><br />Advantages:<br />1) Clear assembly and operating instructions (two different books -- one for assembly, one for operation)<br />2) Wireless chest strap for heartrate monitoring.<br />3) Outstanding quality.<br />4) Easy to fold and move around.  This is still heavy, so be careful with it.<br />5) Great price through Amazon.com<br />6) Huge deck and track (much longer and wider than a normal treadmill).<br />7) Several programs that can vary your workout.<br />8) Quality!<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1) The allen wrenches are useless.  Use good tools for assembly and save on the bruised knuckles and sore hands.<br />2) Custom programs are not easy to set up (have to set incline and speed while in operation).  Pre-setting the time, incline and speed for your entire workout before hitting start would be a nice plus.

Great, sturdy treadmill!
My husband and I purchased 2 treadmills about 6 weeks ago, as we both tend to work out at the same time.  This is a fantastic treadmill for both of us, different sizes and different weights.  A heavy-duty treadmill that will rival many of the more expensive treadmills found at gyms.<br /><br />The boxes were heavy, but the two of us could move a box easily.  Assembly took some time, about 30 mintues per treadmill, but accomplished without trouble.<br /><br />Both treadmills have seen heavy usage...running about 5 miles, 5 times a week, and are performing wonderfully.  The fan is a great idea, but the air movement isn't all that strong...but I haven't found a treadmill with a great fan, so it's not a big issue.<br /><br />An easy to read display and good mix of programs makes sure you never get bored.<br />

A top quality treadmill
I received my Series 7 treadmill about 10 days ago and have been very impressed with it. First of all, the free shipping was great, with the treadmill arriving in less than a week. The EGL Shipping Co. even helped me bring it inside and place it in the room. This thing is very heavy, so be prepared with friends to give you a hand. It does fold up and move around like a refrigerator on a hand truck, though, so it can be moved within the room (not through the door, once it is assembled).  Assembly was simple and took about 45 minutes.  The delivery guys inadvertantly left with the manuals, but it was easy to figure out which bolts went in which holes. Bowflex responded quickly to my e-mail request for a PDF user manual. The Series 7 is sturdily built and feels very solid.  It starts and stops with silky smoothness and runs reasonably quietly. The displays are no-nonsense and give you all you need without a lot of unnecessary graphics.  I like the pre-set programs, especially the fitness test. Only time will tell how it holds up, but so far, I'm very impressed and it seems like a great deal for the money.  UPDATE July 20, 2007: After several months, I still love it. No problems. Highly recommended!

Excellent treadmill
Purchased the product based on the excellent consumer reports review.  I selected the free shipping...no problems as noted in other reviews, other than the dispatcher had Los Angeles instead of Los Alamitos for the destination.  Also, the dispatcher said the delivery would be between 1 and 5 pm...the crew called at 9:00 am and asked if they could deliver early.  Word of warning...this thing is very heavy and hard to handle.  If you can, have the shipping crew move it it final destination. Also, (I'm speaking from a bad experience) don't remove the shipping strap around the belt until you have the unit where you want it.  I found out the hard way that when you put the treadmill on its side, the dang thing folds up...the strap prevents this.

Nice and Sturdy!
I have to say, this treadmill is by far the most sturdy treadmill I've tested in its price range.  The husband and I were almost seduced by the extra (and not really useful) bells and whistles of other brands, but we came to our senses and refocused on the purpose of this piece of *exercise* equipment.  We previously bought and returned a NordicTrack model with a built-in television.  However, the the tread belt was paper thin, which the delivery person actually ripped a hole in during assembly.  The Bowflex Series 7 has a nice thick tread belt and a really sturdy, well-built frame.  Ordering through Amazon, we did have to do the assembly ourselves, but it was a cinch.  All of the bolts and tools came in a bubble card with everything precisely labeled.  No sorting a bag of assorted nuts and bolts!  I do have to say, the treadmill is a BEAST!  We foolishly carried our new Bowflex up to the second floor, which was almost impossible because of the weight and the bulky size of the treadmill.  I mean, we could have died.  But, we got it up to the second floor without any casualties (except for the walls, which suffered a few scrapes) and the five-step assembly was simple.  After a quick calibration, I strapped on the Polar chest strap (included), and did a nice run-walk.  The machine ran smoothly and I got a nice workout.  The other reviewers are right; the fan doesn't do a whole lot, but I suppose it keeps the air around your head from getting stagnant.  All in all, I say the Bowflex Series 7 treadmill is a great investment for your health and well-being--just don't kill yourself carrying it up a flight of stairs!!

Dont hesitate Treadmill is all they say and more
I will not go into any detailed operation description.  Its great and all they say.<br /><br />The cost was $1,389 along with free shipping.  On the truckers bill of lading the shipping cost $345 so it was a deal. On the Boxflex site it was $300 more plus shipping.  <br /><br />Consumer reports rates this model with their highest rating and recommended over all the others in its price range for good reason.  It is built like a brick wall and after using it daily for over two weeks it performs like it should.  <br /><br />The box was about 7 foot long and about 300 pounds.  The treadmill needed to go into an upstairs rec room.  There were two corners in the stairs so getting it up there wasn't something I was looking forward to since I'm 56 and not as strong as I was back in my twenties.  With my wifes help we lifted, pushed and pulled and got it up the stairs around the corners, step by step without damage to ourselves, the stairs and walls and the Bowflex.<br /><br />I was very impressed on how easily it assembled.  Clear, concise assembly instructions and their assembly and operating manuals are easy to understand and of top quality.  I think there were a total of 5 steps.  Everything fit fine.  You cannot mess up.  <br /><br />If you can turn a screw driver and tell the difference between a hex head bolt and a Phillips head bolt you can do it.  Besides there are pictures if your not sure. They include the wrenches and a screw driver in the box. All the pieces that are on the right side are marked so locating where they go is a snap.    <br /><br />Recommendations:<br />Use your own screw drive and Allen (metric) wrenches.  The included tools work fine but using your own makes assembly even easier and quicker.<br /><br />All the pieces on the right are marked.  Put the words "right" next or across from each other and the thing almost assembles itself.<br /><br />Marry a strong stout woman or man if you plan on moving it very far and there are no guys or gals around.  Unless you are Charles or Charlene Atlas, this thing is heavy and cumbersome to move around in the box.  It is still heavy and difficult to move out unassembled of the box, that is  until your on a flat surface and its assembled where you can use the wheels on the unit.  <br /><br />Going up stairs is tough and you cannot do it assembled. <br /><br />Would I buy again?  YES it is a quality piece of gym equipment designed to last. <br /><br /><br />

Love it!
I just received my treadmill and I absolutely love it. It arrived much earlier than expected and was a snap to put together. My husband had it working in less than an hour. He's a big guy and the deck is the perfect size. It also has a cushioned deck which prevents jarring of knees and back. It is very sturdy and should last the distance. I would highly recommend this treadmill.

Information filled review.
I've been an Amazon shopper for a long time now, and when I decided to buy a set of these, I was very disappointed in the reviews. Not the scores, but the lack of information about these dumbbells. So, I did my homework from going to sports stores and trying them out to reading professional reviews, which weren't any better than the member reviews here, and now I've had these for a month or so and feel comfortable enough with them to review them completely and hopefully, informative enough to help you decide. <br /><br />The design is very nice, these were originally known as the Nautilus Select Tech Dumbbells. Nautilus to me is a better known name than Bowflex is for quality, so take that into consideration when looking at these. Though the Bowflex name is on these, they are still made by Nautilus. These are high enough quality to be found in a professional level gym. <br /><br />Some things that I questioned and couldn't find answers to, that I now know. <br /><br />These dumbbells come in stands. The stands are not really enough, and I do recommend the 552 stand for them. But what these stands that come with the dumbbells are used for is to make it much easier to change the weight of the dumbbells. You sit the dumbbell in the stand, turn the knob on each side of the dumbbell to the desired weight, and the plates that you are not using, STAY in the stand. You finish that set and want to add 10 pounds, sit the dumbbell back in the stand, turn the dial to the higher weight and lift it back out. It is that simple. <br /><br />I had read reviews that talked about changing 4 dials each time. This is true if you are using both dumbbells at a time. Two dials per dumbbell. Not four on one dumbbell. <br /><br />I had read reviews that said the plates are plastic. Not true. There is a coating over the plates, but that does not mean the plates are plastic. The coating does cut down on clanking, especially when changing the weight. <br /><br />Next up, the range of motion and bulkiness of these dumbbells, I do not have any problems with these. Here are a few exact measurements to let you see the difference. <br /><br />I have a regular dumbbell, with the spin off collars that hold the weights on. With 50 pounds, 2x10 and 1x5 cast iron plates on each side, from end to end it measures 14 1/2 inches long, the weights are 7 inches high. <br /><br />The Bowflex with all plates on it 52.5 pounds, is 15 1/2 inches long, the weights are 7 1/4 inches high. <br /><br />The 1 inch difference in length is the 1/2 inch on each side for the dial. The difference is not the least bit noticeable. <br /><br />Next, the amount of available weight. While I do agree that the price seems steep for a dumbbell that maxes out at 52.5 pounds, I don't think it is that much different than other sets. Here is what I mean. <br /><br />I was sold on the idea that I should get the Powerblocks because I can use more than 52.5 per arm on several movements I do, but the Powerblocks, at the same price, actually a little higher priced for the Elites 50 pounds max, have to be upgraded for 239 more to give you 90 pounds per dumbbell. Which makes that set around 700 total or the same as the Bowflex 1090 which is also 700 dollars. <br /><br />I include that to hopefully help anyone out that was stuck like me for well over a month, trying to figure out which would be better. <br /><br />While it is true that these are not upgradeable, I'm finding that 52.5 pounds is more than enough for what I'm looking for. I'm no beginner by any stretch of the imagination, having lifted since the 80s. But, for a home gym that doesn't take up much space, these are perfect. <br /><br />Last, in what I considered a strange practice, Amazon shipped these free through ABF. ABF is an excellent freight company, BUT I live in a community of condominiums. The guy called me and was laughing because he didn't think he could get his truck into the community. He was driving a small tractor trailer, not a delivery truck. He did get in though, but thought I would mention it if you order and see ABF as your deliverer that you might have some problems getting them delivered to your door if you live in a tightly packed area. He did offer to wait on me to come get them and said he would load them into my car and even ride to my condo with me and bring them in, if his truck couldn't make the turn. <br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with these dumbbells. The supposed risks of using them are no more than any dumbbell has. When you turn the dial, you hear a clear click to let you know the locking mechanism has the weights secured. Once secured, these plates are not falling off unless by way of something very rare happening, which also is a risk with any weight training product. Do watch the price, it seems to be changing weekly, these were 20 dollars cheaper when I ordered them, but were 75 dollars higher when I checked them out months ago. <br /><br />Hope this helps someone.

Great Product
I've only had Select-Tech Dumbbells a week, so I can't comment on their longevity or how they hold up to repeated workouts, only my initial impressions.  <br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with how they feel when doing every type of dumbbell exercise.  Due to the mechanism that holds the plates in place, using a lighter weight still requires the overall length of the dumbbell to be the same.  Because of that, I was expecting an awkward feel, but that is not the case.  My wife uses 5 - 12.5 pound settings and the extra length is a non-factor for her as well.  We also have a small workout room, so the space saving benefit is a plus.<br /><br />As advertised, just turn the dial and select your weight.  It's that easy.  I have found myself doing proper sets now, where before I didn't want to hassle with changing plates.  It also speeds up the workout.<br /><br />They are expensive, but worth the money if you plan on sticking to a routine.

Sleek design and space saver
I LOVE these dumbells!!!  I got them on sale and they were the best buy I ever made.  I have limited space, so these are perfect for my little condo.  You get a range in each dumbell of 5 to 52.5 lbs all in one little 10"x12" space.  I'm a sucker for design and these dumbells are down right sexy.  I've heard complaints from bodybuilders of the SelectTech's limited weight capacity, as compared to Power Blocks which are expandable, but for me as a woman, these are perfect.  I can't imagine ever being able to lift more than 50lbs per dumbell, and for heavier weighted exercises I use barbells.  This might be a concern for men or stronger women, but if you are satisfied with a max weight of 52.5 lbs, these are worth every penny.

Outstanding design and function..
I've had a set of SelectTechs (552) for about 18 months now.. I use them just about every second day. I even took one half of the set on a three-month family caravan trip, and was able to do all my exercises easily, even in the confinement of a modest-sized van.<br /><br />My thoughts: <br /><br />- They are easy and quick to adjust. Anyone who's wasted time spinning weights off an on will appreciate the convenience. The handles fit fantastically well into my hands - best feeling free weights i've lifted.<br /><br />- They are discrete; they sit in the corner of my living room, offending no one, and pleasing me with their solid industrial design. The stand holds them at a useful angle, and at a good height (and i'm over 6' 4").<br /><br />- They have to be adjusted at both ends of each dumbbell, which some people find inconvenient, but the great advantage is you can set a different weight at either end to perfectly match your requirements. For example if i want to move up from front raises at, say, 8kg (they are sold as kg weight in Australia), but don't want to go up a full kilogram (2.2lb), i simply set one end at 9kg and the other at 8kg.. Voila! 8 and a half kg. After 10kg, the increases are 1kg minimum.<br /><br />- They are a tad bulky, but it has never been an issue for me - consider how many variations on each kind of exercise are possible with free weights.<br /><br />- As reported by another reviewer, the weights do move very minimally on the handles, but there is absolutely NO WAY this movement is enough to affect the balance of the weights. It's just that you can hear the plastic coated weights moving.. big deal.<br /><br />- Since the unattached weights stay seated in the base, You do have to remove and return the dumbbells perpendicular to the base, so they slot in easily (the bases, by the way are plastic, but very heavy and solid). If you tend to drag the dumbbells towards you, then you will find the whole base and unattached weights starting to lift as well.. Again, not a big deal.<br /><br />- I find that the weight adjustment mechanism turns more easily if you apply a very slight pressure down on the adjustment wheel as you change the setting.. if you pull up as you turn the wheel, the mechanism sometimes wont turn.. (this is a very minor issue).<br /><br />- They are expensive as a one-off hit, but as I said, I've not missed a session in 18 months. I'm stronger, and look better.. I really enjoy using them, and I can do the workout whenever i have time, which occasionally ends up being late at night. No way would I have been so diligent travelling to a gym, and no way could I justify a wall of individual weights (not to mention the ugliness of a wall of weights).<br /><br />- The base does require assembly.. But it's exactly as boring as any other Ikea-type assembly. The base is heavy duty and rock-solid.<br /><br />- Some have criticized the plastic and plastic-encased components. I've had no problems with these devices. Where the plastic-encased weights touch each other there are signs of contact, and after several months of use, a tiny amount of talcum-powder-like plastic dust can be seen on the sides of the weights.<br /><br />- The greatest limitation in my view is that after 21kg (or 54lbs) there is no more weight to add.. Now that the bigger set (1090) has been launched, I guess there is an answer for those who need the big weights.. (I need more than 21kg for shrugs, and one arm dumbbell rows, but for the time being more sets or more reps covers that..).<br /><br />My desired result is to be stronger, fitter, and to look better - these free weights are the best thing I've come across. They are beautifully designed tools to help me achieve that. If you're more focussed on how long these devices look showroom new, then maybe your interest is less in self-improvement and more in object collecting (oops, sorry for being direct).

Great concept, very well executed.
The idea behind multiple sets of dumbbells in a single handle is not unique to Bowflex, but it is, by far, the best execution.  The dumbbells are sturdy, very sinple to use, and are completely maintenance-free.  They look as though they are commercial quality, and with a minimum of care, will last a lifetime.<br />The only (minor) drawback is that in order to acomodate all of the weight plates, the handles are 16" long, and this seems if using lighter weights.  In planning to use 20 lbs or less, then consider the 220 Dumbbells, which are shorter.<br />Overall a great product that is simple to use and encourages me to use them regularly.

Solid
Well made. Takes the place of many normal dumbbells. The only minor downside is that they like being upright - i.e. there's slightly more weight on the bottom than the top, so you can't hold it at any rotation like you can with a regular dumbbell.

Nice Equipment!
These are some of the nicest pieces of equipment I've used in a while.  Really easy to change the weight, and at intervals of 2.5#'s up to 25#, these are really versitle and take up almost no space.  <br /><br />I did buy the stand to go along with these and I should add that the instructions for assembly on that thing is terrible.  <br /><br />The dumbells are great though.  Nice addition, and with an adjustable flat-bench, very versitle!

One of the best inventions ever!
Nautilus/Bowflex has a phenomenal winner here.  I cannot say enough about this space saving yet highly versatile set of dumbbells.  They may be pricey, but this product is manufactured with high quality materials and they embody a very efficient use of an amazing technology that is second to none.  The speed and ease of their incremental weight setting makes Superset sessions a snap to achieve.  The bottom line is that there is nothing better on the market today.

I purchased these dumbbells to use with P90X, a program that requires quick changes in weight.  After comparing the price of individual dumbbell sets to the cost of the SelectTech 552s, there was no comparison.  I am very happy with this product.

Best equipment for the money
I'm one of those people that would love to be in shape if only I had the time to workout.  I used to belong to a gym but it took too much time and I could never seem to fit it into my schedule.<br /><br />That problem is gone forever......since I've purchased the SelectTech dumbbells and an exercise bench for my home, I've been working out like a madman and getting amazing results.  <br /><br />The selecttech's are fairly compact and of course offer a wide range of selectable weights to choose from.  They feel solidly constructed though I do have my doubts about long term reliablity since the vast majority of the system is plastic....so far (2 months, 3 times per week) no issues.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best purchases I've ever made and their helping me get into shape like I've always wanted.  GO BIG!

Fitness Freak
I have had these dumbbells for nearly a year now and I am still using them.  Unlike other fitness equipment that I have purchased, my Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells are not just expensive paperweights collecting dust.  I have a schedule that I have been sticking too and have been getting the desired results.  I always wanted to have free weight but never had the room to store a rack of dumbbells or the patients to switch plates during exercises.  The Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells are so easy to use and have a great range of weight.  I can go from chest to shoulders to back with no problem.  They can sometime be a little unwieldy due to the length of the bar but this is easy to adjust to and a small price to pay.

Perfect for your home workout!
I bought these so I would have something to use for resistance training that I could keep int he spare bedroom, next to my elliptical, and most importantly facing the TV :-)<br /><br />S far these have been great!  you can do a huge amount of different exercises with dumbells, and these work very well, take up little room, and make working out more fun.  Highly recommended!

My Favorite Knife
I've got a relatively small knife collection (maybe 15 blades), but this is the one I tend to carry every day.  I've got a few Kershaws, and the speed-safe opening is what initially attracted me to the brand.  That said, while it's a cool way to open the knife, I've ultimately decided it's mostly a gimmick.  I find it's just as fast, and somewhat easier, to open the knife with the thumb stud.<br /><br />My collection has 3 other kershaws: two chives and an avalanche.  The leek is the best size for a carry/defensive knife.  The blade is long without being cumbersome, and the shape is sleek and manageable.  The knife is also good for chores, although for anything really heavy, I'd use a bigger blade like the avalanche or the blur.<br /><br />The black finish is nice -- although truthfully, my leek is titanium oxide (rainbow).  One of my chives is black, though, and the finish is sleek and holds up well.<br /><br />This knife is definitely worth the price.

Great Quality
This is one of the best one handed opening knives i've seen.  Kershaw's Speed Safe really is speedy.  Having the options of using the index opener of the thumb stub makes it a rather versital tool.  You get it sharp and thats how it stays.  Overall, its a really study, reliable, and useful tool.  Definately worth the price and you'll have it a long time.

Awesome Carry Knife
Very subtle and dare I say.... sexy, was my first impression regarding the look. However, the Leek is amazingly functional because it really is a one-hand opener. Bought this for general use, but it is totally capable for a self-defense carry. Very well crafted and machined, smooth as silk operation. Some people prefer the speed-safe taken out (as you can remove it, yourself), but I think it works tremendously and is very well implemented, especially because the Assisted Opening mechanic work so dangerously well. <br /><br />Chipping of the black finish coat should be expected and is normal. This is a serious blade and it comes very sharp! You seriously feel the grade of which this knife operates at. Again, it's a serious steel to pack no matter how you look at it. I still don't know how it'll stand up against hiking or camping use, but I will find out this year.<br /><br />I live in California with pretty good knife carrying laws. A little research would show that the Kershaw Assisted Opening mechanics are totally legal as it does not fall into the 'switch-blade' category. Make sure you read up on your local laws to psychologically prepare yourself in carrying a knife like this one. Remember that if there's ever a confrontation with the authorities concerning this knife, a good rule of thumb is to express politely that you are carrying a knife that is legal under California law. <br /><br />It is VERY important to be aware with current knife laws in your state. <br /><br />I am completely happy with this purchase. Well worth the 35 clams. I'm sure you'll feel the same once you own this Kershaw knife.

One of my favorite things.
I am not a knife collector.  I do not need a knife for self-defense.  I need a knife to cut things and I need it to be sharp and easy to get to and use.  This knife meets my criteria.  The blade is thin which helps with actual cutting, but I would never use it to pry something unless it was a real emergency. Expect the blade to break if you use the knife for anything other than cutting.  The knife body is very thin which makes pocket carrying very comfortable. I removed the clip and the knife virtually disappears.<br /><br />The speed safe feature makes the knife.  I have a hand strength problem and the assisted opening makes the knife a pleasure to use. It is easy to open and easy to close.  The locking feature feels very sturdy and secure and yet is easy to disengage. The size of the knife fills my medium sized hand and feels comfortable to grip.  It is hard to imagine a more functional single blade knife than this one. It is very well designed and very well made. I am very pleased.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
SOLID!
The knife is rock solid, well made of first class materials. <br /><br />NOTE THE DESCRIPTION ON AMAZON'S PAGE IS OUTDATED : Steel on the LEEK is 14C28N and not 440A stainless steel as advertised!<br /><br />The Sandvik steel (same used for scalpels and other high precision medical tools) This swedish steel  has improved corrosion resistance over traditional 13c26. The hardness of the steel falls more and less into the 59-60 Rockwell category. The Framelock can be a little hard to manipulate at first. The Speedsafe, opening assisted blade is fast and can surprise you, be careful with the sharp tip and edge of the blade when opening!<br /><br />I own other Kershaws and all of them have a production date stamp on the blade (i.e. OCT 09), near the edge of the handle (or scale), this one does not have that stamp of production.  Another difference when compared with other Kershaw LEEK is that this particular blade has the normal imprint of the Kershaw logo on the handles and the text underneath that reads "SPEEDSAFE USA" instead of the traditional KEN ONION USA that acknowledges the designer of the blade and the speedsafe technology used on the knives. (see pictures)<br /><br />The carrying clip can be limited and awkward, this clip is  to be used tip up (right handed) or tip down (left handed) or simply you can remove the clip altogether, clip is secured with a couple of  #6 torx screws. (To adjust the blade use #8 torx). The smooth finish on the scales does not interfere with the grip of the knife, way better that the stainless steel version of this knife and less grip than the G10 LEEK)<br /><br />The Knife comes inside a plastic bag on a little -red-white and blue- Kershaw cardboard box (not on a plastic shell hanging rack display) , with basic instructions, warranty information and patent info too.<br /><br />Overall the Knife is solid! If you are looking for a Every Day Carry knife (EDC) that can be classified as a gentleman's knife, this one is for you.  Keep in mind that despite the high quality of the steel, the design of the blade makes the tip a little fragile, do not pry open cans or throw the knife against a tree.... You wanna hunt, or play Rambo...well, this is not the right knife for you then!  <br /><br />After more than 2 weeks of heavy use, cutting, chopping, peeling and scrapping, the blade edge still razor sharp! (BTW, Kershaw will sharpen and service your Kershaw blades for free, just pay one way shipping to them and you'll have you knife pampered by their staff!).

Super sharp, VERY solid locked open, great overall shape even if a little small
Super sharp, VERY solid locked open, great overall shape even if a little small.  Very comfortable in the hand with good thumb and finger rests. I also have the same knife with the partially serrated blade. Thin and extremely easy to carry in a pocket day to day.

Excellent Knife, Confusingly Sharp!
After owning several knives with 4"+ blades, I decided it was time for a knife a little smaller, but still with a somewhat aggressive design.  Based on price, shape, and reviews, this Leek was the best option.  When I first got it, I was a little disappointed because the spring assist often failed to open the blade all the way (the spring is only in effect from about 40 to 95 of being opened.  However, after a couple days of opening and closing it, the knife got broken in and it now opens completely every time.<br /><br />I know this isn't a permanent quality about the knife so usually I wouldn't mention it, but this knife is SHARP!  I have an unused current model Spyderco Edura which is downright dull by comparison.  The tip is also the sharpest I've ever seen on a knife.  The downside to this is it's rather delicate, and I broke a small bit of the tip off within the first week, but it's really only noticeable under a microscope and it still has the sharpest point I've seen.<br /><br />The pocket clip comes attached for point down carry, which is opposite of many higher-end folders.  Using a T6 torx bit, the clip can be switched for point up carry (cannot switch right and left side though).  However, I felt this knife was better suited for point down carry- one of the reasons being that for point up, much more of the knife is exposed above the pocket.  The frame lock is solid and great.  There is a safety tab at the point end of the frame that slides over the tip of the blade to keep it from opening.  I keep this in the disengaged position though.  You may have to tighten the torx screw on this safety to keep it from accidentally sliding back into the safe position.

Excellent Purchase
I did not purchase this knife from amazon, but I *do* own the knife and carry it with me daily. I purchased it after a buddy of mine bought one for use in the military as a utility-knife, and I saw how well it performed for him. It is a beautiful, sleek knife that can stand up to some pretty harsh use. The flat blade makes it easy to sharpen. The assist opening is fast, and sturdy - you'll be amazed that it isn't an Italian-stiletto switchblade with how fast it is (thanks in part to the finger-pull tab section of the blade that you use to open the knife). There is no wobbling of the blade when its open. The only real issue that I've seen so far was that the safety latch can get loose over time, but that is easily fixed with a torx driver. The 3" blade makes it legal to carry for regular use as a pocket knife. If you need a small, light, sturdy knife that's great for utility work, camping, and pretty much anything else you can think of, this knife will not disappoint.

Great Knife for the money !!!
The Kershaw knives are all high quality knives but I especially love two features: The speed safe opening which is as close to a switch blade as one can get and they come super sharp and are easy to keep that way with a good arkansas stone and honing oil.  Good work KERSHAW !

Amazing knife
This knife is great; it's light, thin and perfect as a everyday knife or as that thing you can't forget on a camping trip.  Opening this knife is amazingly easy, and the liner lock is postive until you want to close it. The clip is very low profile.<br /><br />Knife edge and point have stayed super sharp so far.  The finish shows no signs of wear.

Great Knife in Iraq
I purchased this knife when I was in Iraq.  It is, without a doubt, the sharpest knife I've ever owned.  It was perfect for carrying in my pocket or in the webbing of my body armor.  It went everywhere with me and functioned flawlessly.  I was crestfallen when it got lost while I was out one day.  I'm back home now but I'm ordering another.

An awesome little blade!
I've had this knife for about a month and a half now. I wanted to write a review after I spent a little time with it. This is my first review, so forgive me if I'm not as percice as the other reviews. I am familiar with other high quality fixed blades and folders. I've owned Spyderco's and a few Benchmade's. This is my first Kershaw. <br /><br />I wanted a thin, short folder to take with me to work. This knife definetly fits the bill. I keep it in the watch pocket of my jeans and I forget it's there untill I need it. The slim design is exactly what I was looking for, and it feels solid in your hand.  I have to say, right out of the box it's extremely sharp! When it does loose it's edge, it's very easy to sharpen. As stated in other reviews, the Speed Safe opening is a bit of a "gimmic", but it works great. The only problem I have with this knife is that the blade tip is a bit too delicate. Sometimes it feels as though I have an giant X-acto in my hand. Don't expect to do any heavy duty work with this one. It's just for light to medium jobs. Other than that, I love it!

Great Knife
Been carrying this type of knife for quite some time. First knife the torsion bar broke, so Kershaw sent me a replacement. Knife was easy to fix if you have the right torx screwdriver. But I eventually lost it so I had to order this one. Also, I remove the safety catch. I have never had the knife open in my pocket. However, I have had it open when I dropped it. Easy to sharpen, holds an edge. Not too large, not too small, and slim. Nice feature of either opening with thumb or index finger. Excellent knife.

Terrific
A great knife at a terrific price!<br />I could hardly believe it when I saw the price (half of MSRP).<br />I don't understand why the black model was a little cheaper<br />than the uncoated Stainless Steel model though.<br />The MSRP for those knives is the other way around.<br />I had owned, and lost, an uncoated one and after<br />a suitable period of mourning sought a replacement.<br />I now like my new black one just fine.<br />The "Speed Safe" feature is a wonder and this knife is<br />just the right size for everyday carry.<br />The drop-point style blade also suites me just fine.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VC9YK">Kershaw Ken Onion Black Leek Folding Knife with Speed Safe</a>

Well the knife is great but the seller sucks
Ok so I bought 2 of these bad boys for posterity and of course I changed them both to tip up position. The first one someone used lock-tight on the screws so then when removed they were alittle messed up. Then when I put them into the proper holes and what?!?!?! they didnt fit cause those holes were stripped. Awesome. Ended up having to send both blades back to the manufactures for repair. Still got the backup though. So ...oh well.

Best knife owend
This is a very easy operating knife to use. It comes very sharp so be careful, and the safety feature is nice to since all you need to do is to slide the safty hex screw to theleft to unlock it abd to the right to lock. It is light weight which is an added bonus since the knives I owned are somewhat heavy compared to this knife, the price is very reasonable for the great quality. Since all the knive I have gotten before was the price you get for the quality. I believe the company takes great pride in making their knives because it comes sharp eaqsy to use without problems and its great slick looks. What else could you ask for in a knife.<br /><br />I be buying another one if needed and would recomend this to all knife and sporting lovers, and what are you all waiting for order one now....

CAN'T BEAT IT
I use a knife everyday and always have one on me.  This is my first assisted opening knife.  I will never be going back.  This knife is extremely sharp(ask me how i know).  the action is extremely quick and smooth, not too difficult to close(watch where your fingers are), and its made here in the good ol' United States of America.  Used to be a huge Gerber fan, but now im all about Kershaw.  I recommend this knife to anyone who uses there knife daily. GREAT KNIFE!  <br /><br />One con, but the tip is too narrow to be used for prying things open. I broke a sixteenth of the tip.  Still thats kinda on me, so the knife still gets five stars.

***Awesome Little Knife***
This is by far the best little pocket knife I've EVER owned. I have the Brushed silver finish But the quality and operation of these are the same.<br /> Kershaw's Customer service is top notch and Amazon had a great price.<br />This little knife holds as good or better an edge than my Buck Knives,....It opens and closes very easily, one handed, and is not as tough as others have said here in other reviews.<br />All in All your money will be will spent here.....and I'm planning on buying a second in the black to have hunting......The only down fall of any kind is for myself I wish they built some in Tan and OD Green non-reflective finishes....if they did I'd buy a third....

Kershaw Leek
The Kershaw Leek is is a very high quality knife which opens very smoothly.  The only negative is the handle on this model.  It's too smooth and could easily slip out of your wet hand.  I like the black finish on the blade.

Great Looking, well crafted knife.
This was my first Kershaw Ken Onion knife and I love it.  I carry it with me all the time.  The belt clip can be removed or flipped upside down by removing two allen screws.  It's it small enough that it doesn't feel bulky in the pocket, yet has a large enough blade to do any type of cutting.  The tungsten coating has also prevented further abuse.  I absolutely love the speed safe feature, it makes opening the knife incredibly easy (and fun too).  I have yet to see any problems with the knife opening inside my pocket, there is also a lock to prevent the blade from opening. I plan to make more Kershaw/Ken Onion knife purchases in the future!

Nice, fast pocket knife!
I use it as an everyday pocket knife. Very fast and sharp from factory so like the previous person mentioned be careful when opening it the first time. I bought it to replace my old Swiss Army knife as an everyday pocket knife. It is light and relatively thin so it is easy to just clip it in your pocket and you barely feel it. A very sleek-looking knife although the finish seems it might get scratched easily if you're not careful.

Kershaw Black Leek Speedsafe
I have purchased several of these knives. What happens is that I take one deer hunting and all of my buddies want one so I sell the one I have and buy some more.

Nice touch Kershaw!

VIDEO and review for Stylus Pro light

<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great light Great price
Lightweight, intense light, easy to operate with one hand- this would be an incredible tool for law enforcement or an emergency responder. I'm buying a few more immediately I doubt one could ask for a more versatile hand held light. The beam is very intense- might even do well as a self-defense item as it is blinding if shone directly in the eyes. Money well spent!

Super!
Never owned a better light!<br />Super bright, easy to get batteries, tough construction and even a holster with a lifetime guaranty.<br />I also bought the Streamlight Ulta Stinger and it too is wonderful.<br />Streamlight has turned me into a light junkie.<br />I'm spoiled and will never buy another Maglite nor anything else.

Say, "Ahhhhhhhhhh"
I am a resident physician and The Streamlight 66118 Stylus Pro is a great light for me.  I was tired of using cheap penlights that always seemed to break or flicker and where not very bright for assessing pupilary reflexes and patients' oropharynxes.  During the early morning hours when patients are still asleep, this light also comes in very handy to assess surgical wounds as well.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this light, and would strongly recommend it to anyone who needs a small but bright light.

Perfect for doctors!
I'm a veterinarian and have been looking for a penlight that won't break when dropped and won't stop working when wet.  I've FINALLY found the perfect light!  Not only is this thing shockproof and waterproof, but it also puts out brighter light from a pen light than I've ever seen in my life.  I finally can get accurate pupillary light reflexes from a pen light!  I've recommended this to many veterinarians, and all have given rave reviews!  This little flashlight is amazing!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Love it!  (with a caveat)
This is a great pen light for all the reasons stated both above and in other reviews.<br /><br />However, if you're a medical student/EMT/nurse/doctor, don't think that you can pull double duty and make this a light to check pupils with.  It's just way too bright, and your patients will hate you forever.

industrial drop tested...
I am a service tech for industrial cranes.  i have a need for a small portable light because many times i am working up high where normal lighting just doesn't shine.  the streamlight 66118 is a very convenient way to carry a small, bright light to places where i need some illumination for checking crane components in dark places.  recently, my streamlight was dropped from a height of approx. 25 feet onto a concrete floor.  i was worried because even shock proof items can break after that kind of a fall.  when i got back down to ground level, it still worked.  i was very impressed to say the least.  i would recommend this to anyone looking for easily portable lighting.  It's definitely going to be a stocking stuffer this year when i buy presents for friends and family.  you can't beat it for $20.

Totally impressed with this little flashlight.  Small size fits and clips easily into pants pocket. Surprisingly bright beam shines much farther than I expected.

Great light by a great business.
I purchased this light about 8 months ago. I took it with me for my travels in Asia and India. It came in handy often for electrical outages, arriving in dormitory arrangements late at night, checking bed frames for bed bugs, etc. I absolutely used it everyday, and many times each day. I often left it running for half an hour at a time during outages. I'm still running on original batteries, though I have no idea how those things are still kicking, and its running just as bright as ever.<br /><br />Recently I noticed a rip in the rubber end cap. No biggie, though I figured it may not serve my waterproof needs for my canoe trip this coming summer, so I emailed them asking if my lifetime warranty still applied, admitting that it traveled in my pocket every day for an extended period of time, and that I was probably to blame for any damage. They told me to send them my address and they would be happy to send me a replacement end cap and, "I'm happy to get your light back up & running for you!"<br /><br />Excellent product! Incredible brightness and longevity in a very small, durable, well designed pen-light. Excellent customer service.

Always with me and my wife
I bought this based on a review I saw from a guy who does all kinds of gear reviews on youtube. He was right. For $20 this is a must have. I bought 3 of them. One for my car, the house and one for my wife to keep in her handbag that she uses. She is currently in grad school and uses it every night walking from class to her car, its a good deterrent. <br /><br />PROS - <br />AAA Batteries<br />About the size of a pen<br />Lightweight<br />One button to push at the end of the light<br />Clip <br />Will take a beating<br />Only $20<br /><br />Cons - <br />Can't think of any<br /><br />Well worth it.<br />

Flawless flashlight
This is a very cheap flashlight compared to the quality and power of light. With 24 lumens (it looks much more powerfull) I would highly recommend this. It is a very quality product, too. I have been using this over a month- only evenings-approx. 10 minutes each evening- and the light is not powerfull as the first day but still very good. 66118 model runs with two AAA batteries. I bought 66318 model too. 66318 runs with one AAA battery and has 20 Lumens of power. 66318 is much shorter (almost half), without holster, but light power is almost the same. If the job is not extremely demanding, I would highly recommend both Streamlight 66118 and Streamlight 66318 instead of investing over 100 dollars on bigger flashlights.

Great flashlight
I'm a service tech and need to hunt around the dark innards of machinery. This light has earned the coveted position alongside my Kendo Gel inkpen and retractable Sharpie in my shirtpocket. Geeked out, I know, but I take my tools seriously and this light is the perfect combinbation - very bright, durable, lightweight. The best I've found yet. I used to carry the skinnier Streamlight penlight but this one beats it hands down ( triple-A batteries versus the hard-to-find AAAAs and the 66118 Stylus Pro has a circuit which sustains full brightness over the useful battery life)

Small, Lite Weight and Great!
I ocassionally need a flashlight at work, but it needed to be small and  portable. This Streamlight Stylus Pro, at about the size of a large pen filled the bill perfectly. It has plenty of light for my needs at 28 Lumens, and I can carry it in my uniform shirt pocket. It's alway there when I need it. It runs on two AAA alkaline batteries, and has about seven hours of run time. It is made from aluminum and has the clicky type switch on the rear. It would probably be a handy light for inside your car too. It is much less bulky than a Mini Mag. If size and portability are issues for you, and 28 Lumens can fill your needs, I would highly recommend this flashlight.

Excellent little light
I've been carrying the Streamlight Stylus Pro and the Streamlight Microstream for a couple of years now, and I think I can safely say that these are excellent lights. I never leave home without one of them. <br /><br />I compared them to my 4 C cell Maglight (non LED) and promptly got rid of my Maglight. The light cast by both the Stylus Pro and the Microstream were very comparable to the Maglight, but at an obvious weight advantage (not to mention battery consumption).<br /><br />I started out carrying the Stylus Pro in my pocket, next to my trusty pocket knife, but, after about a year I bought myself a Microstream, since is fits so much better. Now the Stylus Pro sits on my night stand for when I need to check on noises or anything like that. <br /><br />My wife liked the Stylus Pro so much that I bought her one too. <br /><br />One other very positive note: One day at work I brushed by a pallet of boxes and caught the pocket clip of my Stylus Pro on one of them and it bent out really bad. It eventually broke. I called up Streamlight and told them what happened and they sent me two pocket clips free of charge (attached to two tail caps!). This is an awesome company and they provide excellent customer service.<br /><br />I would STRONGLY suggest that if you're looking for a nice little flashlight, get yourself either one of these lights... Or heck, get one of each :-)

Great Little Light
Bought this Streamlight and carry it everyday. I'm a flashlight freak, already have the smaller Streamlight pen light, but it doesn't compare in terms of light output and the CREE LED. The Stylus Pro is only a bit bigger, but you can still carry it in your shirt pocket. The price is right as they are only within a couple of bucks of each other and the Stylus is right up there with LED lights costing 2 to 3 times more. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase.

A MUST HAVE PEN LIGHT!
I am a registered nurse and, if you are one too (or know one), then you know how horrible the "standard" penlights that we use for pupil checks can be. They always crap out on you, they burn out fast, the batteries die fast, etc. So, I googled "penlights" and I was eventually brought to amazon where I started doing some research. After reading all the reviews, I decided to give the stylus pro a shot and, I have to say, I am not disappointed whatsoever. Ok, granted that the brightness of the LED would temporarily blind any patient (sarcasm) if you're checking for pupil reactivity (you can get reactivity out of almost any pupil), but it works great for a "mini flashlight" as well. I work the night shift once a week at a nursing home and this makes it easier to go into patient's rooms without having to turn on lights and wake patients up. Plus, with the wonderful use of the push button, you don't have to worry about your penlight staying on (on accident) and the batteries draining.<br /><br />The penlight itself is fully functional under many capacities. I love this penlight so much I keep showing it to my co-workers/peers and have gotten one other person to buy it (I've only had it a week!)... I highly recommend this penlight to anyone!

BEST FLASHLIGHT EVER!!!!!!!
This is the best flashlight I have ever owned bar none!!  The beam is SUPER BRIGHT! Nicely focused. The light is extremely well built.  You can use this thing as a backup for your car's headlights in an emergency!  Forget Mag-Lights forever and get a hold of one of these bad boys!!!

GREAT flashlight !!!!
Finally!<br />A good products.<br />If you're like me, you've been buying a bunch of those "great deal" flashlights for $5-$10 that <br />only last a few months and never work quite right.<br /><br />I got tired of those and plunked down $20 for this unit.<br />What a RELIEF!<br />I mean, it just works (and works and works).<br />Feels great, very small, great finish, great light switch, batteries last a long time,<br />beam is super bright,  I just love it!<br /><br />Had mine for 9 months and sadly lost it on a new year camping trip.<br />Ordering a new one right now.<br />Strongly recommended!<br />

WHAT A GREAT LIGHT
This is a great flashlight.<br /><br />I bought this light thinking I would get a okay light for a good price. I intended it to be a back up for a bigger and more powerful light. when i finally received the light from amazon I went and tried it out and was astounded how powerful it was it was the day time and i could see the beam from a fairly far distance. then i tested it in the dark it was very powerful and casted a wide light and then a more concentrated beam which i find really useful out side when hiking.  another thing i noticed is the size of it , it is tiny. it easily fits in a pocket and stays there because of the clip. <br /><br />     when you are hiking or camping you need 2 basic things in your pocket a good knife or preferably a multi tool(i carry leatherman wave another great product) and a compact flashlight. the stylus pro is great for the job.<br /><br />PROS<br />good price<br />very powerful<br />compact<br />sturdy<br />very well built<br />uses a common battery (3AAA)<br />the battery life it fairly good<br />light weight (only weight is the batteries and two small 3AAA batteries are not heavy)<br />CONS<br />the button which turns it on is not very easy to turn on<br />when switching battery's the clip makes it very hard to unscrew <br />  <br />this is a great light and recommend it good power for a great price.   thanks for reading !!

Excellent Light, Good Price
I Purchased this light to fill an "every day use" role and I must say I have yet to be disappointed.  It has performed flawlessly every time.  The light throws a clean, fairly bright beam considering it's size and power supply (Two AAA's} and has a respectable 7.5 hour run time (real world use has shown about 5-7 hours, depending on battery quality).  Overall I am very satisfied with this light and highly recommend it for anyonelooking for a small, rugged, dependable, and inexpensive light source.

Small package, big surprise!
I highly recommend this item if you're looking for a penlight with the power of a much bigger flashlight.   This flashlight is about the size of a thick pen and fits nicely in your shirt pocket.  The light this little bad boy puts out is impressive.  <br /><br />Before buying, I was concerned that the light output would be insufficient for my needs. I work nights on a shipping dock and frequently have to look into pitch black trailers(53ft). I had been previously been using a mini mag lite that I converted with an led kit.  I rarely have more than one hand free at any time so I was looking for something that I could conveniently pull out of a shirt pocket.    <br /><br />Did my research, found this item highly recommended and made the jump figuring I would return it if things didn't work out.  Well let me tell you, this little flashlight is brighter than the maglite I was using. It gives me an intense focused beam at over 50ft away. I've tested it at home and it does better than bigger led flashlights that I purchased at [...]. <br /><br />Overall, I'm thoroughly satisfied. It's well built; the click switch on the tip of the flaslight is heavy duty. You can spot press it or fully press and keep the light fully on. At first its almost too hard to press It in completely but that's because u kind of have to get used to pressing it. It's safe to say that this light will never accidently get turned on.  And as for the light it puts out, I'd like to see another penlight beat it!  If you're a doctor and you're thinking of using this for checking throats and eyes, don't!  It's too bright; use the smaller version.  Hope this helps, good luck!

Streamlight Stylus Pro is perfect!
I am a delivery driver for FedEx Express, and I wanted a powerful yet portable flashlight that I could keep in my pocket. I was shocked at how bright the Stylus Pro was for its size, I can't say enough good things about this product. The design is very well thought out, and rugged, the shirt clip truly is "Non-Destructive" as I have put it thru hell, and the bulb is very bright. I would recommend this flashlight with out reservation!

Great pen light
Awesome little penlight, bright for its size, uses normal AAA batteries, and doesn't burn them up in 2 hours like some small, high-end lights do.<br /><br />Update- been using this light for a year now, daily as an HVAC contractor - the finish is all scratched, but the button still works like new and the light still works flawlessly.  Its been dropped, stepped on, soaked, and anything else that can happen.  It's a perfect and highly durable penlight - I'm going to buy the smaller model as well, no reason to touch a mini maglite ever again.

I love this light!!!
Let me first say that I have been using this flashlight for over a year now. The LED is EXTREMELY bright and the two AAA batteries last a considerable amount of time. Longer than I would have thought. The shirt clip is extremely useful. I put it in my shirt pocket every single day at work. If I'm pinned up under a dashboard with one hand on something, the other hand can quickly grab the light from my chest pocket and activate the light. SOOO useful. I have read several people saying the button is a little difficult to push. I have certainly NOT found this to be the case. Be it the momentary position or the constant on position. Button is perfect in my opinion. When my coworkers and I are both working on a vehicle, they find themselves always asking me for my light. They know it's quick and easy to put into action. I am seriously considering these lights as Xmas present for all of them.:-)

LED Compact Flashlight
These 2 flashlites I bought for our trip to Alaska have worked great.  Bright light sure helps in the darkness to see your way.  Cool blue color, too.  Sturdy construction and small enough to tuck into a corner of our travel bags we use on trips and store for emergency use if needed.

Great deal for the Money!
I bought 2 of these for $2.99 each. Even with the high shipping and handling they were a great deal. Now that I see you can get them using Amazon prime for $4.99 I may buy a bunch more. FYI-I consider myself a flashaholic since I have an extensive collection of flashlights and these are probably the best bang for the buck I've seen...

Great compact flashlight
It has a decently bright, fixed narrow flood pattern, in the bluish-white spectrum. Useful for walking at night, and its 3.5" length is great for for cramped spaces. Compared to the $25 Dorcy 41-4275, it's less focused and has &lt;slightly> less power. Can't be beat for $5.50!

Can't beat it!
As a home inspector, this light is bright enough to light up dark attics and crawlspaces (surprisingly bright!) and cheap enough that I won't sweat it if I accidentally leave it behind or lose it in the attic insulation! That hasn't happened yet, but just in case!

Great Light
It works fine. Seems to be a quality product.<br />As to the health warning, "LED" is not the same as "LEAD".<br />This has a light emitting diode not a lead emitting diode.<br />I hate to think the warning is on the package because of some government agency.  I wash my hands of it.

Neiko Super-Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Cool Blue Color
Very handy small and very bright flashlight. Takes 4 AAA batteries that were included. A good buy.

Brilliant light, perfect for keeping in car, purse, even around the house
This is such an incredibly good product - the LED's are bright, the bulbs last forever, and the batteries on the ones I bought months ago haven't needed changing yet, even with daily use. The construction is excellent. It's a little hard to thread the loop of the strap through the pinhole-sized eyelet at the back of the flashlight cylinder, but that's the worst I can say about this. I paid $8 for these at another online store, and they were still worth it. At the price here, even better.<br /><br />Once you have a few, you can find great uses for them:<br />- Outdoors, of course - camping or simply going for a walk<br />- In the garage or toolbox for finding stuff<br />- As emergency lights, tucked away accessibly in each room<br />- Personal flashlights - in your car, purse, camera bag<br />- Supplemental lighting for your camera if you take close-up pictures of nature or anything small (your built-in flash can't point that close to your lens)<br />- Carry them while bicycling - spare headlamp for your bike

Excellent little flashlight for emergencies and everyday use
This review applies to the following 3 products (same item, just different color: jet black, gunmetal gray or cool blue): <br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LIOPTS">Super-Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Gunmetal Silver</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LIOPTI">Super-Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Cool Blue</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LIQQ7M">Super-Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Jet Black</a><br /><br />Most LED lights you find in stores now for this price use those exotic lithium "coin" type batteries, but not these little flashlights. These use regular AAA batteries (3 of them) and those are available just about anywhere, and you can even find rechargeable AAAs easily. So battery cost is low to negligible. <br /><br />The price itself can't be beat at $2.99, but what are you getting? <br /><br />The body itself is aluminum, not plastic. And that's good. The whole thing fits in your fist very comfortably, very light, yet feels nicely built, solid. Even tapping with your fingernails gives a solid tock instead of thin metal clink or plasticky clack. <br /><br />The general shape is round, but with "ridges" so it should not roll much, even on a flat surface. <br /><br />The trigger as at the rear end, and there is only one power setting. This  makes it more like police-style tactical lights, but also makes it impossible to stand "up" on a flat surface for use as a temporary torch. <br /><br />The endcap is NOT o-ring sealed so it's NOT waterproof, but tight enough to be water and splash resistant. Don't dive with it, but it should work in the rain well enough. And being so light even WITH batteries inside, it's virtually shockproof.  <br /><br />Open the endcap and you see a "battery holder" which slides out. You load the 3 AAA batteries into it (all clearly labeled). Slide the holder back in, seal the endcap, and you're in business! <br /><br />The light is pretty darn bright, though a bit scattered. I also have a LED Maglite (which cost me $25, has a single 3-Watt Luxeon LED, uses 2 AA batteries) and this is almost comparable to that brightness. However, my Maglite (tm) has focusing controls, and energy management circuit inside, as well as a "torch mode". This little thing can't do any of that. But at 1/8th of the price, does it matter? <br /><br />Yes, it's made in China. Don't expect miracles. You'll probably see a couple DOAs and the batteries they include are lousy generic alkalines. Replace with quality alkalines or even rechargeables soon to save even more money. <br /><br />All in all, $2.99 for a flashlight is very good, and this flashlight can rival stuff costing five times as much, which makes it a definite bargain.

It`s not the size of the prize.
I bought 8 of these to help out during the coming hurricaine season down here(Florida) and from what I see i think everything is gonna work out fine.Bright light, easy ergonomics and a great feel in your hand(it is only 3 inches long but the circumference is full in your fist and the batteries load like you were filling the chambers of a weapon .)So when the power goes off I believe the light from these little sawed-offs should fill the rooms;yes, the light is that strong.( I would suggest dumping the batteries provided and pick up duracell AAA wholesale.)Either way these flashlights seem like a great bargain for any season.And as tough as nails.(I like the silver gun metal color.It fits)

This little light of mine
Excellent little light, I have bought a few for camping and more for friends.  Only one caution, when installing the batteries read the markings.  As I am guessing this may be the problem with some of the self absorbed geniuses on here who can't get this light to work.  One battery goes + side down the other 2 are + towards the bulb end.  As far as light goes, this little light will light up an entire campsite with white light and blind anyone you shine it at close range.  Enjoy, I a ordering more for just about every spot I had am conventional flashlight.

More than expected
I thought it is plastic cover while it is metal cover. It is really well built. The light is bright enough for looking for something in a dark room or in a car. The light is a bit less focused though. But considering the price and the quality, I'm more than happy that I made this choice.

Great little LED light !
The first thing I did when I got this light was click it on and off (several hundred times) to see if I could make the switch malfunction. I figured that would be the most vulnerable part to wear out first. It didn't break, and I was just about to give the light a thumbs-up review, when it inexplicably started to flicker and then stop working at all. Before I returned it to Amazon for a refund, I decided to take it apart, examine it, and use my digital multimeter to see what the problem was. The test results were fine (no shorts, no opens) this light SHOULD work. I found the problem, the end cap and flashlight body were not making good contact. The black annodized coating on the end of the battery tube was the culprit. I sanded it with nail file, till it was shiny and screwed it back together and it now works 100%.  I'm sure that's what is happening to most of the customers who have had bad things to say about this little light. It's a quick easy fix, and I'm keeping mine.

I got this for a friend to keep in her glove box since her block is poorly lit and she always comes home late. As far as I know, she's liked it. I got to play with it for a while and now I'll be ordering a second.

Good quality inexpensive light.
I originally bought 2 of these lights.  I've had them for 16 months now and both have consistently functioned perfectly!  They feel solid, seem well constructed, and of course are extremely inexpensive.  In terms of performance, this little light is almost as bright as my 3 C cell maglite, at a fraction of the maglight's cost and size. There's something about the design/dimentions and weight of these things that just "feels right".<br /><br />While originally inteneded for use in the car, they're now kept by the bed and used regularly (lately when taking the dog out walking at night). The battery performance is great (after 16 months at least one of these is still working on the original included set of AAA batteries).  Seriously, how can you go wrong for under $6??  <br /><br />I just ordered 6 more!

Cheap, Functional, Easy.
This LED flashlight does everything I need it to. It turns on, is super bright, is small, and turns off. Its perfect for keeping in the car and you can't beat it for under $5. It is made fairly well and includes batteries. I've had no issues with mine and I've found it to come in handy on many occasions already in the week or so I've owned it! I would highly recommend this little, super bright, light...especially for the price.

Great Buy!
After going to the store I was frustrated that the only bags available were either EXTREMELY expensive or poorly built. I knew that I wanted something that would last beyond a couple outings, but I wasn't going to pay an arm and leg for it. The zippers on these bags are GREAT (one of the most important features in a sleeping bag). The material is very light, but incredibly warm. The bags are also a snap to re-pack in their stuff bags. Did I mention these things are LIGHT? Highly recommended.

Nice bag
I took this sleeping bag on a cold, chilly night in Tallahassee, FL. I went as low as 18 degrees, lower than the rated 25 degrees. It kept me warm all night and all I wore were two layers of PJ's.I dig the narrow design so it makes it easier to roll and tote. The only down side is that I am 6ft tall and I couldn't rap the mummy hoodie over my head. <br />My recommendation, buy it b/c for the price you can't loose.<br />I can't wait to take it out camping again at Terreya Park.

Happy w/ Bags
We bought 3 Coleman Taos bags for our kids ages 13, 13, and 11. For the price I was not expecting too much, but I was happily surprised. We have used the bags summer camping in Southern Oregon and Northern California. Temperatures at night were probably never below 40.  The kids said they slept warm and comfortable. Bags stuff real small and the workmanship seems good.

Warm Bag, great Pack Weight
I recently used this bag for some late-fall / early-winter camping just outside of Lost City, WV. Temperatures bottomed out to just under 30 degrees and dressed in nothing but boxer briefs and a cotton t-shirt, the bag (in conjunction with a Thermarest sleeping pad) kept me quite warm and sleeping like a baby throughout the night. I am 5'8", 150 lbs and the bag fit great with room to spare. While a little tricky, it was certainly not impossible to jam the bag back into the provided stuff-sack. While I do not have the exact measurements for the bag in its stuff-sack, it's small and will even fit into a day pack with some room to spare. Great product. Recommended.

Very warm
This bag is very comfortable, long enough for me (I'm 5'9"), and it is very warm. It was easy to zip because of this thing that rides in front of the zipper that pushes the fabric out of the way. I was very happy with this bag.

best value sleeping bag for the money
I've been backpacking with this sleeping bag for the past 2 months. It is great and it didn't hurt my wallet. It is light, relatively small stuff sack (you'd have to pay $100 for a smaller sack) and most importantly it is warm and durable.

This sleeping bag is great!  Our family of 3 went sleeping and all three of us had different sleeping bags.

I bought this sleeping bag for my son due to the fact it is lighter to carry for his BoyScout trips into the field.

What a great deal! And we connected 2 together easily!
After waking up one morning to  an unexpected 33 degree temperature, and after a rotten nights sleep due to the cold,  we decided, never again will we camp without adequately warm sleeping  bags.  These are amazing for the price. We zipped 2 together easily for my husband and myself and we bought 2 others for our boys... and we feel like they will serve us well when we need them. They are comfortable, and roomy and have features of much more expensive bags. I am very pleased with our purchase and we may buy more to keep in the car in the event of an emergency.

realy warm
Nice sleeping bag, but you cannot zip two of them as it advertised. To do this you might have to specify this when you place your order. In general, it is really warm, but kind of reduces the space for the legs so that you feel really like a mummy :)..

I bought this without knowing a lot about sleeping bags and I'm not a person that goes camping a bunch. I'm in a band and and dance troupe and I needed something to take on tour.

Warm and Cozy
This sleeping bag did an excellent job keeping me warm on our most recent camping trip.  Temperature probably didn't get below 40 so not a test of extreme temperatures, but it performed admirably.  There are two drawstrings within one at the shoulder and another around the top, they helped in keeping the heat inside the tent and not escaping through the opening.  The zipper works well, opens quickly, though closing it the last few inches proved a little difficult when completely inside the bag.  The bag itself is not the most compact out there, for the price it is a good size, could be used for a day trip and short backpacking trips.  Would recommend to those looking to stay warm and cozy while camping under the stars, or inside a tent.

Great for us easily-frozen types!
I get cold all the time, but not with this bag!  While I wish the interior wasn't that cold, slippery polyester-type fabric, once I am in and zippered up - holy cow does it keep me warm!<br /><br />The draw-string collar and draw-string hood are FANTASTIC additions and really help to keep me snug without feeling claustrophobic.  And by snugging those two up tight, I get the advantage of a little leg room in what I initially thought was a kind-on-the-big-side mummy bag.  Now I get to sprawl (a bit) AND still stay warm!

Very warm and comfortable
I didn't expect it to be so warm. I went to Rocky Mountains and although it was summer, the temperature in the high altitudes dropped quite low (around 40F). I did not complain of being cold at all while all my friends did. I didn't test it in 0-degree but I think I could easily go down another 15 degrees, I'm not sure about 0...... Another thing is that I was hesitant about buying mummy type sleeping bag because I thought I would be tied and and unable to move all night. Surprisingly I was very comfortable. It might be because I'm quite petite - only 5,5 tall.

Great tent!
This tent exceeded every expectation I had. I was skeptical of only having a stake at each corner, but when properly set up the tent is extremely stable.  The steel and fiberglass poles are all heavy duty and the set up is easy with 2 people (only took 10-15 min. without instructions). The rainfly is easily assembled and appears to cover all the mesh.  It did not rain on our trip. The nylon seems to be of good quality and the stitching is heavy duty and taped.<br /><br />The interior is very efficient thanks to the near vertical walls. I would expect to be comfortable with up to 4 people (we were only 2). We really liked the all mesh roof which is great for stargazing and ventilation. We also liked the large mesh windows that can be zipped for privacy. There are large windows on each wall. Everyone else in our group seemed to admire this tent and a few expressed interest in getting one.<br /><br />The weather was dry and windy the first day.  We had gusts up to about 30 mph. and the tent never budged. I suspect the rainfly had a lot to do for the stability as the guy wires anchor close to the support poles.<br /><br />Overall I love this tent and find it hard to believe that anyone would dislike it. This tent is not designed to handle extreme wind, but anyone with common sense knows you shouldn't use a cabin tent if you expect violent weather.<br /> <br />Tips:  1)Always place a waterproof tarp under your tent.<br />       2)The stakes that come with this tent are subpar. Get some inexpensive steel stakes.

Great family tent
I like this tent so much, I'm actually taking the time to write this review (which I never do for anything).  I'd call this the Toyota of tents (well built, reliable, inexpensive).  First the setup was incredibly easy.  I did it myself, and it took me about 10 minutes for the tent itself, maybe another 5 for the fly, and 5 more for the guyout lines.  We set up the inside with a queen air mattress and two single air mattresses and there was still about a 6 x 6 foot area for our gear.  It was windy, and rained a bit on our trip, but the tent held up quite well.  It stayed completely dry.  The winds were about 20-30 mph, and the walls did move in and out maybe about 6 inches each way, which is pretty darn good for a straight wall tent.  Here's a few pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:  Easy setup, easy takedown (fits easily back into the bag), good ventilation (completely mesh screened roof and 4 huge closeable windows), all vital seams are taped.  The metal poles are steel cable corded (not chain like the tent description says) which I think is good.<br /><br />Cons:  The bag it comes in is made of the same material as the tent.  I wish they had used something a little thicker and stronger because I'm not sure how long the bag will hold up.  There are no side pockets inside the tent, only the gear loft that hangs up top.  As most other reviews have said, the door zipper gets stuck on the waterproofing flap.  This makes it almost impossible to open with just one hand.  The stakes that come with the tent are pretty much useless.<br /><br />Tips:  When setting up and taking down the tent, the stakes should be the first and last thing installed and removed.  I learned the hard way taking it down, I took the stakes out before the poles, and wound up chasing the tent through the forest when I light breeze picked it up and tossed it.  Also buy some real stakes for the tent and ALWAYS use the guyout lines, they are a necessity with this tent even in light winds. <br /> <br />Conclusion:  Buy it!  You can't do any better for this size in this price range.

Awesome tent for its intended purpose.
This tent is easy to assemble, has quality components and won't break your bank.  This is not a backpacking tent.  It is heavy and comes in a large/roomy bag.  The tent's features are adequate.  We use it in the Adirondack mountains where it is woodsy and remote.  We enjoy sleeping on a cot instead of the ground and this is the perfect tent for that. We put silicon on it and seam sealer on the seams (we do with all our tents).  we are dry and warm.  It is large enough for 4 or so, but if you're cot campers, stick with three people and your gear, you'll be more comfortable.<br />Some comments suggest a flimsy tent...they did something wrong.  Yes, the semi-straight walls will catch the wind, so be thoughtful.  This tent is perfect for the three season tenter.<br />Use caution when using a cot on soft ground. You could damage the floor.<br />Happy camping!

Seen em all This is the Best!
This Tent is the perfect size,shape,weight for a great camping experience. I've put it up and taken down many times by myself with no problems. The square style adds to the easy setup and provides nice room for plenty of gear and a big bed. Windows are big allowing plenty of light. A sales person(kid) tried to talk me out this type by indicating it's only perceived fault which is that rain could get in due to the small overhang over the windows. My experience in an actually downpour was to...close the windows! No problem. I anally reviewed many tents and companies and am 100% satisfied I have the ultimate tent!! The Eureka Designer who came up with this should be promoted. It was well thought out for assembly, strength, room and portability.

High Marks for Copper Canyon
A great tent!  Used a queen size, double decker, blowup, mattress and had plenty of room on either side to walk, etc.  Loved the height of the tent!  Super, quick, setup!  Sturdy construction ... withstood a thunderstorm!  A quality product!  Very pleased with the decision to purchase this tent!

A Great Tent....
Well, I can't be sure of why the other reviewer would consider setting a tent up in the living room, but c'mon.... To set up any tent correctly it needs to be staked down with the fabric taut. We've camped with this tent this summer for a total of almost 6 weeks and as usual from Eureka it's a top notch product. No problems at all with any wind and through some pretty heavy rainstorms it stayed totally dry inside. Actually my wife and I used this tent but then purchased a Eureka Copper Canyon 1512 which believe me, the interior of that tent is MASSIVE. (She needed more interior space she stated... Yikes!) so our son camped with this tent on our site. Due to its cabin/dome design it has much more room then you'd expect from a tent this size and as with all Eureka tents the fabric quality and workmanship of the tent is superior. Based on my experience this summer with both tents I highly recommend them... You won't be disappointed.

COPPER CANYON 10 is a winner!
Excellent tent. Roomy and Airy. Large windows provide excellent ventillation. Easy to put up. Claim of 5-6 people is a bit optimistic (but this is pretty standard amoung tent makers), however it is an excellent tent at a very reasonable price.

Excellent value and quality
This was my first experience with the Eureka! brand and I was duly impressed. Very solid and very well engineered, little to no movement in gusty wind up to 15 and 20 MPH. The tent has very heavy duty poles, zippers work well, it was easy to set up and take down, and fits easily in it's carry bag.<br />Being 6'2", I was impressed with the height of the ceiling. I was able to stand straight with room to spare, and not only in the center of the tent.<br />The only misleading part in the description was where it said "A fly with clear-panel skylights permits stargazing". There are two very small "clear" panels in the fly that are very blurry. They do let light in, but no stargazing is possible. With the fly removed however, nearly the whole top of the tent is screened, proving a very good view of the sky.<br />I would recommend this tent for both serious and casual campers.

Excellent tent
I have used this tent several times for "car camping".  After years of dealing with tiny 1-2 man tents, I got fed up and searched explicitly for a tent that I could stand up straight in and not hit my head.  I am six foot tall, so this tent fits the bill.  It has withstood fairly decent rain and wind without problems, however it is extremely tricky to set up with only one person, and in ANY amount of wind - it is hard to prevent one corner from collapsing before running over to secure another corner. In order to securely assemble this tent, you must stake down the four corners, AND use the supplied guy wires with sufficiently beefy stakes.<br />For two to four people, this tent is perfect.  If you are going solo, it might be overkill unless you really need the space or height.

BEST TENT EVER!!
I went camping for 2 weeks straight in this tent. With all weather, rain, wind, sun etc... it stood strong and was a wonderful. nice and spacious, i was able to fit a big queen size air mattress in it and many other things. it stayed dry and was just great. if was you i would get this tent, or any other from eureka! they make the best tents that are so worth the money you put into them, if you take good care of your belongings.<br />

A very well designed tent.  The vertical walls increase useable space without increasing the footprint.  Perfect size for two people, cots, and gear.

Copper Canyon 10 is a great tent at a good price
We bought this tent after reviewing many via professional and owner reviews.  It has lived up to the positive hype.  Easy to set up and take down.  Nice and roomy.  Dry. Sturdy.  Did not have much trouble with the door zipper, as some other reviewers did, but you do have to watch for it catching.  Bought a good set of tent stakes - the ones it comes with will work, but they are a pretty cheap variety.  Had plenty of room for a queen mattress, gear, and a chair, with room to spare.  The power port let me run a cord in without worry about water or bugs.  Well ventilated - is not a winter style tent.  Everything fit back in the storage bag with little trouble. Looks good to. For the money, hard to beat.

Love my Copper Canyon 10!!
Even though I didn't buy the tent from Amazon, I thought that maybe I should leave my review.<br /><br />I had been doing research for months for a new tent as I was to be attending my first Burning Man event in August of '09. Every time I searched for a tent, I kept going back to this one for some reason. The size of it was enormous, which extra space is what I needed since I was going to be in the desert for 8 days, and I could put all of my camping gear inside and still have some room for friends to hang out in my tent. Set up was extremely easy for one person as well. The tent is HEAVY if you aren't expecting that, but after setting it up a few times I didn't mind. Most of the weight is in the poles which to me is a sign of quality. I camp mainly in the warmer months so I can't say how well it works in the winter, or in rain for that matter. I can tell you that every time I set it up after the Burning Man was over, I have enjoyed my tent very much!

very happy
we bought this tent last year and used it 3 times so far. We are only 2 and the tent is big enough for us, we put our queen size bed inside and have room to walk around, my husband also fits his luggage in.The windows are big, ours doesn't have the zipper at the bottom though but didn't matter. Easy to assemble be careful when handling the poles, the elastic  broke in one pole but we fixed it with no problem.<br />We love it

Great product. One person can easily set this tent up without much effort. I installed the rain flap in the middle of the night without any trouble. Well made and full of pleasant surprises.

Happy Camper !
Howdy! I purchased this tent as a replacement for my old 16x9 tent.Being a camper for over 40 years,I wanted time proven design, along with functionality and newer lightweight materials. I had the same issues as everyone else finding a review for this tent as none were available at the time of my purchase. After many hours,I decided on the Copper Canyon because of the weight, seperate doors for each room, and the footprint was a little more managable than the Columbia everyone likes. Also Eurika has a good reputation for quality and design.<br />  The craftmanship and materials are top notch.All seams are double stitched and many are taped.<br />  Setup was a breeze with my 11 year old daughter(about 20 mins first time)Takes about 15 mins myself now.<br />  I was very pleased with the vertical walls. Being 6'5" it was great being able to walk corner to corner without having to duck!<br />  I almost could'nt beleive how high the tub floor seams were above the ground.<br />  I love the sweep out feature at the doors,this makes clean out easy because you dont have to broom out over a seam!<br />  The rain fly protects well without obstructing window view and at 150 square feet this is very roomy for me and my three daughters.<br />  It goes back in the bag easily and is easy to carry.<br />                           <br />                               Now the meat.<br />  <br />  This tent was field tested in the back yard.I set it up and let it up for 4 days for seam sealing. The first day a violent thunderstorm rolled through(40mph winds and walls of rain).This was before I had applied seam seal.I was totaly surprised this tent held its own. The walls stayed rigid and kept there form. After several hours of pounding rain I was quite relieved to see only a small wet spot(about 3") where the drivin rain was forced up under the fly(my fault I left the fly unattached to the center post). All the door and window seams were dry.<br />  The self healing zippers are good with reinforced fabric seams.As with all tent and sleeping bag zippers,they should still be handled with care.<br />  I was very pleased with the "no see-um" mesh in the windows and doors. After 3 days not a single bug got in untill I left the door open on day 4. The awning works well for sun and rain.<br />  All this said I am very pleased with this tent.It is a great buy, with great features and I can and will recommend it to all.I gave this tent a 5 because the craftmanship and materials are very good with no defects anywhere,it survived that wicked storm unscaved, and it sets up and down easily.It has a great size to weight ratio and I had no trouble getting it back in the bag. Its also easy on the eyes and looks great in the woods(No red!).I hope this helps and I wish you all the best on your next camping trip....Enjoy it out there folks!!<br />

A Great Choice!
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7D1TK">Eureka! Copper Canyon 1312 Eight-Person 13- by 12-Foot Family Tent</a><br />For more than two months we searched for a new large family tent.  We looked at several "name" brands and studied, studied, and studied some more.  We had our previous Eureka tent for 30 (yes 30!) years and it finally got a bit worn.  We settled on this tent for it's size, features, feedback from current owners, and previous experience with Eureka.  And we liked the way it looked!  What a great choice!  First let me offer a rebuttal to some of the more common concerns I read about this tent:<br /><br />1/ The shock corded poles are EASY to put together and understand.  As with anything, being careful helps.  Take them apart and put them together carefully.  <br />2/ My dad once said "When all else fails, read the directions".  I did that before beginning and it really made assembly easy.<br />3/ Lay everything out carefully before beginning, and it's easy to figure all the parts out.<br />4/ Don't do ANYTHING before the directions tell you to.  That's how things get ripped, broken etc.  Don't force anything.  You don't have to with this tent.  If you are forcing something, you're doing it wrong!<br />5/ It's a BIG tent.  Have someone help you set it up.  If you want a big tent, expect it to take some extra effort and time to set it up.<br />6/ DON'T set it up for the first time in the dark.  Practice before you go on your first trip with it.  It's fun!  <br />7/ Notice how it comes out of the bag and refold it carefully.  We got it back in the bag with no problem....poles and all!<br />8/ Drop the awning and angle it away from the tent when it rains and there is absolutely no problem.<br />9/  Zippers worked just fine.  Again....Be careful!  Don't rush.  With proper care they work just fine.  For us they didn't hang up at all.<br /><br />This is an AWESOME tent!  With proper preparation, it went up easily and staked out perfectly.  We went to a state park for the first outing and had several heavy rains and some pretty fair winds.  It didn't leak and it didn't budge. It is great fun and plenty large enough to hang out in during inclement weather.   We liked the fact that the floor was flat throughout the entire tent.  It gives such a look of roominess. And I'm 6'0 tall.  The height througout is amazing.  You will love this tent.  If you take care of it, it will take care of you! <br />

Great tent for family camping
I have 5 kids ranging from ages 7 to 20 (3 boys and two girls) and we took this tent camping over a 3 day weekend.  It was extremely spacious and easily accommodated everyone plus our gear.  Just like a traditional cabin tent, the tall sides make it very roomy, plus you have the easy  convenience of setting it up as you would a dome tent.  Two of my sons are over 6" and had no trouble at all in this tent.  Don't put too much stock in the room divider for any sort of privacy though.  If you are hoping to have any real privacy while tent camping, you're kidding yourself.  That's just not going to happen.<br /><br />The tent actually holds the heat in quite well.  At night, the outside temperature was down to about 40 degrees. A small tent heater, plus the heat from 6 bodies was enough to keep us cozy. Normally, I would not even take a tent heater when we camp, but the power port made it a very convenient option.  It was very warm (85 degrees) during the day and the very large zippered windows made it easy to let the breeze flow through and keep it comfortable inside without the flying insects coming in through the screens.  <br /><br />The stakes, as have been reviewed earlier, are not worth the metal used to create them, but I had heavy duty stakes ready for the task.  We had some strong (30-35 mph) winds on the second day, which really whipped through the canyon we were in, and the tent stood up to them very well. The guy lines are conveniently stored in pockets attached to the tent and work very well.  We did not use the awning.  That just seemed kind of silly to me.<br /><br />All of the window and door covers are reinforced and the zippers are very good quality.   The poles are simple to understand and the tent is easy to assemble.  The floor is a little thin considering the very good quality of the overall tent, but if you take an appropriately sized heavy duty tarp along as a ground cover, its just fine.<br /><br />A couple bits of advice:  First of all, while this tent comes with a bag, it is not going to last through a lot of use.  Get yourself a golf bag which can be zipped closed to carry this tent.  Not only will you have better straps for carrying the tent (37 lbs), but additionally you can now easily carry a hammer and the tarp.  Second, set the tent up in the backyard before you go camping with it.  Once you understand how to set it up it's a breeze, but you don't want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what goes where when you open tent up.  It is so big, that it could seem overwhelming to assemble for the first time. (it's not tough when you have no pressure to figure it out.)<br />  <br />I also have to note that I am a scoutmaster for a local Boy Scout troop and camp an average of 20 nights per year.  Our troop uses tents by this same company and I have watched Eureka tents stand up to some very serious abuse for years.  Not only has inclement weather played a role in that abuse, but boys can be a pretty hard on the gear. This company has admirably withstood the test.  That played a big role in my decision to purchase this tent for my family.  Buy this one with confidence!

Can't believe it all fits back in the bag!
I bought the 10 X 10, great, but too small, this one was perfect size, still able to put it up myself (I am 5'8" female).  It was roomy and held up well to the wind.  I shopped around for a long time before buying the copper canyons, I practically need a mobile hotel room and that is what I got.  Everything works well, zippers, rainfly, etc., no problems and I highly recommend this tent.  I did look at the Cougar Flats set up at a store and didn't like that the room divider is built in and you had to step over a riser even if you didn't want a second room so it cuts down on how you can lay out the room.  Also, I sincerely doubted being able to fit everything back in the bag, but sure enough, got it all back in.  Great tent, love it.

Excellent Family Tent
I recently purchased this tent for the Memorial Day weekend and had it shipped over night. I had it two days after ordering. The tent is very spacious and has alot of features. There are two doors which are very useful. The windows are over-sized which provide plenty of air flow. The rain fly worked excellent on the last night when it rained all night. There were no leakes at all! The rain fly has a built in canapoy which works well during the rain also. There is also a removeable dividing wall that is very easy to use. There is no built in tarp on the floor of the tent like in other models I have seen. I used a tarp for the ground underneath and it worked well. The set up was extremely easy my wife and I had it up in less than 30 minutes. I would recomend this tent to any one who wants an excellent product at a reasonable price.

Excellent Choice
After researching and researching and researching some more, I finally settled on the Eureka Copper Canyon 1312 tent for our "2 or 3 times each summer" family rustic car camping.  The other contenders were the Columbia Cougar Flats and the Wenger Lugano 16'x10' family tent - both of which had their merits.  I chose the Copper Canyon, but could have gone with any of the three. <br /><br />We just returned from our first-use trip - a three night visit to Tawas Point State Park on Michigans' Lake Huron Coast.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.  Here's why:<br /><br />1. very spacious, with vertical walls for easy stand-up walking and large door(s) for easy entry/exit.  we fit two jumbo cots, two smaller cots a table and all our clothes & bags. and still had room left over.<br />2. quality materials, heavy duty zippers, double-stitching everywhere.<br />3. easy setup/teardown, fits back in bag easily, very light for it's size.<br />4. awning is useful for protecting entry from rain.<br />5. held heat well on 50F nights with windows closed, but aired out well during day with windows open.<br />6. moveable after assembly (nice if you, like me, always seem to want to move the dang tent a bit after it's up)<br />7. plenty of hooks for gear lofts / tent light / storage bags<br />8. the tent just looks good, dangit.  maybe petty, but that's a nice thing when you spend this much money on something ...<br /><br />To be fair, there are two gripes I have about this tent.  They are:<br /><br />1. The divider curtain is a joke - it might as well be clear plastic - you can see right through the thing.  We didn't really need this feature, so it didn't bug us too much, but if you're counting on some privacy between the sides, you're not going to be satisfied.  It's strange that in a tent which is so well constructed otherwise, Eureka would cheap out so badly on this feature...<br />2. There are no tent stake loops on the midpoints of the long tent sides.  (Odd, because there are loops on the short tent sides ?!)  Not a real big deal I guess, but I hope that doesn't burn us in windy conditions.<br /><br />That's it tho. The good far outweighs the bad, and this is by far the nicest tent I've ever owned.  If you can find it on sale and get it with free shipping, it's an excellent purchase.

Great Tent
Did a lot of research looking for a new tent this year. I finally just bit the bullet and went with this tent after being an avid Coleman person for years. I read several reviews about the Eureka brand I was impressed. I really liked the design of this tent and decided to give it a shot.<br />It has more than enough room for my boyfriend, my dog, and myself. The description doesn't make it clear, but all of the seams are factory sealed. The tent poles are color coded for easy set-up. We took the tent out about 5 times this year and I offer you the following from my experience.<br /><br />1. Read the directions. They include helpful tips that really make a difference. I don't normally like directions, but actually found these to be logical and helpful.<br />2. Put it up in the daylight the first time. Trust me you'll be thankful you did. After you know what you're doing it's a snap to do it in the dark.<br />3. The floor is a bit thin so purchase heavy tarp of tent pad to extend the life of your floor.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I are able to have this tent up and ready in 10 minutes flat - we both absolutely love it. He gave me a little grief at first when he hear how much it cost, but he agrees it has been worth every penny. It held up beautifully during a rain storm on our first trip and held it's ground solid during heavy winds on our last trip. I don't mind the fact that the flooring is lightweight because it makes it easier to fold, clean, and carry. I love the see through ceiling skylights, the secure rain fly and the incredible ventilation. We have absolutely no condensation inside our tent - even in humid Seattle weather. I was concerned that the high walls and mesh ceiling would cause it to not hold in the heat on chilly nights, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was not familiar with the Eureka brand prior to this purchase, but I can now say I will be a long term customer. My friends with tents from brand names like Kelty and North Face are equally impressed with the quality of this tent.

A superior tent for the price!
My husband and I used to camp many years ago in CA. We moved to TX and put camping behind our mind because of the hot weather. Recently our 8 year old daughter told us she would like to experience camping. Without second thought, I reseach extensively for a new tent. Our old tent was small for 2 adults, one child,one dog. Besides that it was worn out. We decided to go with the Eureka Copper Canyon 1312.<br />   We liked this tent very much! The structure is strong and well built. I thought it was too big when we set it up in our backyard. We followed every instruction in the manual. We sealed all the seams that needed waterproofing and the rainfly. We changed the cheap stakes and bought heavy duty ones. We used heavy duty tarp for the tent pad. We also used light duty tarp for the tent floor inside to prolong the life of the tent floor. Setting up this tent is easy and fast with two people. One person can do the job but would take longer. We like all the tent features. We went camping a couple weeks later and I was amazed at how beautiful this tent looked like from the outside and very spacious inside. After putting all our camping stuff inside the tent, it was just the perfect size for us. We have a queen size double height air mattress, a twin air mattress, 3 sleeping bags, a dog bed and all our gears inside the tent with enough room for walking. We even had a fan because it was hot at night. All in all, it was the best choice for us. My daughter wants to go camping again sooooon! We enjoyed our camping trip and was happy with our tent. We hope to camp many more years to come! :0)<br /><br />

Excellent Tent - Spacious, Durable and Affordable
I purchased this tent as a replacement to my 8 year old 10x10 Coleman dome tent. My biggest complaint with the Coleman was that I could only stand up in the center of the tent. There is so much room inside this Eureka. I can walk standing straight up around the interior of the entire tent. <br /><br />I took the family to Juniper Springs in the Ocala National Forest. We had 2 adults on a king size air mattress, 2 children on single air mattresses and 2 100 lb dogs as well as a table and all our gear for the trip. The kicker was we still had enough room to place a heater by the door out of the way and maintained an area to walk between the mattresses.<br /><br />We were surprised with a strong storm front that blew through the campground dumping about 2 inches of rain accompanied with heavy winds. Once the storm blew over we found there wasn't one drop of water inside the tent. A day later we had a low temperature of 28 degrees and there was no condensation on the interior walls as a result of using the heater all night. A testament to the quality of this tent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a durable, easy to assemble, spacious family tent.

Love this tent!
Also am new to the 'family' tenting vacation.  Have done a lot of tent camping as a single person many many years ago so this is a new experience for me.  As with many of the other reviewers, I based my decision on online research and other reviewers opinions.  Took the plunge with this tent and 'so far' couldn't be happier.  We did as most people recommended, read the instructions first, then pulled everything out of the box and sorted the poles then started assembling.  From the time it took us to lay out the bungy poles to finally pegging down the tent it took a maximum of 20 mins for husband to have it up (with the help of our little 5 yr old).  Will definately be able to set it up faster second time around (and with out the help of our little one :-).  Definately am glad that we did not try it for the first time in the dark but am sure if you are used to putting up large tents it wouldn't be a problem, very easy.  Slept in it for the one night and just LOVED the open screened roof.  Gave a fantastic uninterrupted view of the stars.  Don't know what it is like in wind and a bad rain storm but so far we are very happy with our purchase and can't wait to go camping in it.

Great Tent
We recently took this tent camping and it was great.  Easy set up, a lot of room, we had a queen size double height air mattress, 2 end tables, 1 chair and plenty of room for all of our gear.  You can stand up straight anywhere in the tent, which was one of my requirements.  Love it, I would recommend this to anyone.

very happy with purchas
A BIG tent and very easy to put up.  Only takes a few minutes.  I am 6'4" tall and it is great to be able to stand up to put my pants on.  You can even walk around inside.  In addition to our queen size air mattress we also keep all our clothes, two folding chairs, a small table and a Porta Potti (no odor) inside.  We had another Eureka tent (smaller) before this and have been very happy with both of them.  We would definitely recommend this tent.

Took Grannies Camping
I want to THANK - RockLobster(Jun13/07)and T Cline(May31/07)for their detailed reviews. They helped me purchase a wonderful tent and because of their reviews I knew exactly what to expect. Please, please read their reviews.Also read the reviews from L.A. Andrews(Oct5/07) and David J Adams(Sept16/07). They said it all better than I could.<br /><br />I took two grannies(81&87)camping for several days, I'm 59. We all had a blast. This tent is wonderful. The three of us put it up and two of us took it down. I also got a Coleman queen raised air bed for them to sleep on. There was room on either side of the bed for a small plastic stands w/drawers for their clothes, books etc. On the other end of the tent I had a card table that held our electic cooler and the fan. There was still plenty of room for me.<br /><br />The large windows were great. We had a storm while camping and were cozy and dry as could be. I did seal the fly ahead of time and sealed the inside and outside of the tent seams twice after setting up. This tent did everything I could have wanted and I got it for $199.97 w/free shipping. We're looking forward to next year and my daughter and I this fall.

Nice tent
This tent has plenty of room to stand up in, it's comfortable, easy to put up, and withstood a good little windstorm that happened while we were gone from the site.  Nice ventilation, attractive.  It also withstood a couple of days and nights of drenching--I repeat, DRENCHING--rain.<br /><br />

Quality Tent from Eureka!
After doing alot of research, I settled on the Eureka Copper Canyon 1312 tent.  Being used to a 8x8 dome tent which was very cramped for me and my three children, the Copper Caynon tent has more than ample room for us.  I was impressed by the overall quality and relatively easy setup (using two people is much easier).  We haven't experienced high winds or rain yet, so the verdict is still out in that department.  Not only a larger footprint than our dome tent, but I like being able to stand up anywhere in the Copper Canyon with its near vertical sides.  Leaving the rain fly off allows a beautiful view of the sky with it's all mesh top.  The extension cord slots are a nice touch to avoid tripping over cords at the doors.  Nice job Eureka!

Durable & Spacious
My husband and I love to go camping and go on average 20days a year.  This tent requires the use of two people to set up. As always read the instructions first and follow the instructions to a "T". Make sure you do a practice run to get a feel for how the tent is set up. It took about 15-20min for 2 people to set up in moderate weather. This tent is wonderful for the durability and roominess of the tent cabin. Most tent rods are flimsy metal rods connected together with bungee-like elastic cord. The tent rods that go to this tent are sectional metal rods put together that will withstand high gusty winds (35+mph) without compromising the rod/tent structure. This tent is roomy considering that you can easily fit two queen size air mattresses and still have room to put other essential camping gear inside the tent. There are plenty of windows in this tent. One feature I really like about this tent is that it has two doors. Coming from a previous Dome tent owner (and the fact that I am 5'11")the Eureka Cabin tent is a godsend as you can stand up completely in every area of the tent. One word of caution though, when opening and closing windows and doors, zip up the windows and doors carefully or else it will get caught on the tent fabric. As for the tent stakes that come with the tent, trash them. Buy metal tent stakes as they will stay in the ground better. Additionally, the tent floor material is the same the tent side material, so buying a standard tarp underneath the tent is a must if you want to keep your tent floor from getting punctured. Overall, I would recommend this tent to other campers, especially ones with families.<br /><br />

Eureka Copper Canyon 1312 Tent
The Eureka Copper Canyon 1312 Tent was a great camping experience.  Good price with lots of room.  The tent was very easy to assemble and we like the power cord doors.  We used a large fabric drop cloth and a couple of entryway rugs to protect the flooring.  JH

Well Designed Tent
I've owened a variety of tents over the past years.  I've bought cheap ones and I've bought expensive ones.  About 12 years ago, I bought a Eureka 4 person tent for my wife and I to go camping.  We loved that tent since it was so easy to put up.  But after adding a couple of kids, its time to buy a new tent.<br /><br />After researching many tents, I ended up choosing this one for many of the reasons that other reviewers have said.  However, there are a couple of things that really make this tent special and show the excellent design of the product.<br /><br />When I first opened the tent, I was planning on spending the day sealing the seams.  I was able to setup the tent in 20 minutes by myself, and was pleasently suprised that all the seams were taped on the floor, around the basin, around the doors, and the windows.  The rain fly was even taped.  <br /><br />The next thing that I noticed were the flaps over the zipper.  The outside of the tent has flaps of fabric over the zipper to stop wind and rain penentration.  <br /><br />We have several trips planned for the summer and can't wait to put it through its paces.

Great tent
We set up the the tent in the rain, very easy set up. There was an all night down pour, not a drop of rain in the tent, is was very cold at night<br />used coleman heater to stay warm, because of the size of the tent two heaters were needed. Did O.k. trying to stay warm.. I would recommend this<br />tent to anyone looking for a cabin style (big) tent.

Loving mine so far
This is definitely a "drive in" sort of tent.  Even hauling it from a parking lot to your site is an effort.  As others have noted, it's also big enough to mention when you're checking into a campground.  Given that, I enjoy most aspects of this tent.  I used it four times over the summer, in various kinds of weather, and it stayed upright and kept me dry.  The aluminum frame is heavy, but also strong.  The height and near-vertical walls make it easy to move around in, and the included divider is great when you have children.  The windows are huge, and there are plenty of places to hang gear.  Its size does attract attention.<br /><br />One night, during heavy rain, I accidentally had the ground tarp entending beyond the floor of the tent so it caught the water and collected it under the floor.  The next morning I felt like I was walking on a waterbed, but I was remarkably dry.<br /><br />Stuff to keep in mind:  I am 5'7" and setting it up by myself was barely achievable.  In heavy rain remember to zip the power port closed.  The awning is not practical in rainy situations, as it simply collects water (no matter how much you adjust the slant).

Very Large - Good Quality - Nice Design
After a miserable & shocking experience, waking with water dripping on us through our used Coleman cabin tent, we tossed it into the garbage & quickly researched our way to the Eureka brand name.  With the help of the great reviews on this website among others online, we picked this tent for our family, feeling confident that the quality was worth the cost.  We have put this tent to the test a couple of times now & are very pleased with our purchase!  <br /><br />Here is a quick review of what we have found:<br /><br />Pros:  <br />1)  Great size for a family of 4, gear + 100lb dog<br />2)  Easy setup the second & subsequent times - the first time is a little slow.  I am 5 ft tall & can put it together alone except for the 4 velcro attachments on the front and the back of the fly.  It is not a dome tent or a popup - so, for those who expect a super easy setup will be in for some shock - we have primarily owned cabin tents so for us, it isn't a problem to work a little harder to get the benefits of a cabin tent.<br />3)  GREAT ventilation, windows on all sides & exposed, unlike a dome tent<br />4)  Good Quality seams & material on tent walls, fly, awning & roof<br />5)  The awning is wonderful & large - as mentioned by another reviewer, the instructions are not clear on how to install it so we just attached it to the fly on the three front points, put the poles in at an angle & set up the guy lines to secure, then zipped up the side of the fly & pulled the middle guy line over the top to create a bit of a dip in the awning so water could run off.<br /><br />Cons:  <br />1)  It is larger than most campground tent pads that we have found.  Arrive early to the campground or scope out a campsite in advance, just in case you won't fit - bring a measuring tape to double check!<br />2)  The floor is made out of the same material as the tent, it seems quite thin for flooring material<br />3)  We wished it had more accessible pockets - our old Coleman had a bunch of pockets that were reachable from our sleeping bags so I could put a flashlight & my eyeglasses in it, to access at any time.  The pockets with the Eureka are on the center divider & then there is a separate one that we can't figure out where it is supposed to hang at so we hang it off the window hooks.<br /><br />Suggestions:  <br />1)  As with all new tents, the manufacturer recommends to seam seal the tent prior to the first useage.  It is an inexpensive & easy thing to do but it takes time & effort to get it done.<br />2)  Definately use a tarp UNDER the tent flooring, I would not want to put that directly on the ground.<br />3)  Carry a measuring tape with you on your camping trips - you'll want to check the tent pad size before you start putting this up!<br /><br />Overall, we are extremely happy with our purchase & we would recommend it to those who like the cabin style tent<br /><br />

Pre-Seasoned is the Way to Go!!!
After struggling with a set of three regular cast iron pans from a different manufacturer, I finally boxed them up for Goodwill.  I never mastered the seasoning part of cast iron usage.  I ended up with a sticky residue and one pan rusted.  After about three attempts of scouring and reseasoning, I gave up and ordered three Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned skillets.<br /><br />It is fanstastic.  It worked like a charm with the first use -- no problems with sticking at all.  I actually smiled while making my burger!  My cornbread was also back up to Southern standards thanks to my 10-inch pan.<br /><br />The 10-inch works well for cornbread and frying.  (Actually cast iron is the only way to make good cornbread.) I use the 8 for single burgers.  The 6 I bought out of habit, but it also works well for single burgers.<br /><br />Clean up is relatively easy.  Wash with hot water; Lodge does not recommend using soap.  Dry thoroughly.  I then heat mine on the stove top, turn off the heat, add a tablespoon of oil and use a paper towel to spread the oil on the entire pan inside and out.   After the pan cools, I wipe away any excess oil and store the pan. <br /> <br />For anyone who wants a head start on leaving heirloom cast iron pans, I strongly suggest this product.

Lodge is immortal!
I'm still using the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet that my mother got for a wedding present in 1954! I give this pre-seasoned version as wedding gifts, housewarming gifts, and to those kids stepping out into their own apartments. Cast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money, and this pre-seasoned version takes the hassle out of "getting it ready to use." Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet and Dutch Oven! She'll hand it down to the next generation. A must have for EVERY kitchen <br />

Speaking of Roasted Potatoes
Another reviewer mentioned roasted potatoes.  I agree, this is the perfect little skillet for a single serving size of potatoes.  Try this recipe for a late night snack:<br /><br />1 baking potato<br />2 or 3 unpeeled garlic cloves, (optional)<br />1 pat of butter<br />Shredded cheddar cheese<br />Olive oil<br />Salt & pepper to taste<br /><br />Wash potato and cut in half lengthwise.  Cut the pat of butter in half and place in skillet. Put a potato half, cut side down, on top of each piece.  Lightly coat the garlic cloves with olive oil.  Place cloves in skillet.  Place skillet in oven and bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes or until tender.  The cut portion of the potato will brown and crisp.  Remove potato halves and garlic from skillet.  Carefully remove garlic skin. Make a slit in the cut portion of the potato halves.  Add garlic if using and season to taste with additional butter, salt and pepper.  Top with cheddar cheese.<br /><br />I make this in my 8 inch cast iron skillet a lot. It's the perfect size for single serving meals and snacks.  It also makes the best hash browns and since it's not that heavy and already preseasoned, you can flip the hash browns like the pro's!  <br /><br />The 8" and 6" cast iron skillets are also great for tapas. Set them on trivets and serve right at the table.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Cast Iron - Cannot Be Topped
I own 2 of these little pans, 1 of them for over 30 years & the other had been my mom's for many years beyond that.  Had I known back then what I know now (how many times have we all said that?), I would have bought mostly cast iron instead of all the other cookware.  It does take a little time to properly care for cast iron but it's sooooo worth it to me.  These cast iron skillets turn out a great grilled cheese sandwich, too!  Just use a lid on the pan & be sure to cook only on medium-low heat.<br /><br />Several years ago my mom gave me a wonderful recipe (see below) to make cornbread on the stovetop in the 8" skillet using a lid, flipping the cake over once the batter looks almost done to cook the other side.  You have to use 2 spatulas to flip it (the reason for using the 8" skillet).  I tried flipping a 10" ONCE & found it takes a better woman than I to get that right!  This technique makes a more moist & better cornbread according to my DH & me. Another added benefit is that you don't have to heat up the oven/kitchen.<br /><br />In a small bowl, mix 1 cup of **self-rising white or yellow cornmeal, 1 Tbs. sugar (optional).  In a separate small bowl, whip 1 egg with fork & stir in 2/3 cup milk.  Add egg/milk mixture to cornmeal.  Stir together just until all is moist.  Melt 1 to 2 Tbs. shortening in skillet over medium heat.  Sprinkle pan with cornmeal (not too thick) stirring to brown it.  This will give you a crustier side.  Lower heat to medium-low & add batter to pan and cover.  Check batter & once it's looking a little more done than a pancake would, flip the cake using 2 sturdy nylon spatulas.  I prefer to cover after flipping & it will be done in less than 5 more minutes.  For crustier bread leave lid off after flipping.  **Or use regular cornmeal with 2 tsp. aluminum free baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt in place of self-rising - I'm sort of guessing at these amounts as a replacement for self-rising.  <br /><br />If you'd like to read my method of seasoning cast iron, go to the Lodge Biscuit pan and read my review there.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063RX7O">Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Drop Biscuit Pan</a><br /><br />My DH laughs at me because of my admiration of raw cast iron, enameled cast iron and how I care for them.  I now have 2-10", 1-12", the biscuit pan, muffin pans, as well as the Lodge Pizza Pan.  The pizza pan makes a wonderful crust.  If we have left over pizza, we melt butter in one of the larger skillets over medium heat.  Put 2 or 3 slices in & cover with a lid.  Reduce heat to medium low.  It will take just a little patience but it will taste as if it were fresly baked.  You'll probably stop warming pizza in the microwave.<br />

love it
My wife "dragged" me to an outlet mall the other day.  I wandered around with a couple of the kids and wound up at a kitchen store.  I bought the lodge 8" for a few dollars more than the Amazon price (didn't check beforehand).  My mom had a 12" cast iron frying pan that she constantly used when I was growing up.  At the time I thought it was kind of gross as it was crusty and she never actually washed it.  She would just wipe it out and run it under hot water and then dry it on the stove.  Despite the grossness the food always came out great so I didn't complain.<br /><br />This lodge pan seems like a mini version of my mom's.  Very solid and with proper care it could last for generations.  I have now used it probably about 5 times and each time it becomes a little more "non-stick."  Today I made a shameful breakfast from the past.  Bacon and eggs (and I cooked the eggs in the bacon fat!)...horrifying and delicious! I'm not sure that my wife will allow that breakfast in the house more than one a week. ;-)<br /><br />The pan is just about perfect for cooking for one or making a side dish.  Here are a couple of things to remember:<br /><br />1. Follow the simple directions on the back of the label as far as use and care.<br />2. Never use soap, wipe out the grease and then wash in hot water.  Use a stiff kitchen brush if needed.<br />3. NEVER wash in a dish washer<br />4. NEVER leave it wet...it will rust!<br />5. Put about a teaspoon of cooking oil on a paper towel and rub the oil all over the pan after you towel dry it.<br />6. This thing retains heat so take that into account when cooking.<br />7. Mine is starting to act like a non-stick, but without potentially harmful chemicals.<br />8. Cast iron should work on most cook tops, even induction.<br />9. You may even get some beneficial iron in your diet!<br /><br />Reccomended.

perfect
Are you kidding - $13 for a skillet this great.  I have always used "non stick" pans with a coating, but they always get scratched, can't take the heat, and after reading about the health concerns, I wanted to find something else.  This pan is perfect.  It holds heat so much better than the thin non-stick pans so the cooking process is much more consistant.  Just finished making a steak, and my wife and I agreed that it is much better than the outdoor grill.  Eggs are great too.  Easy to clean, just a little hot water and a brush.  Coat with a little oil when done and it is ready for the next use.  It is even made in the USA!!!

Great little pan
There is NOTHING like this for making cornbread.  I would never go back to making cornbread the way I used to (gasp...in glass pans or muffin tins) before I bought this pan.  I always wondered why my cornbread didn't come out right.  Now I know!<br /><br />

Fantastic!
I primarily bought cast iron cookware to escape Teflon, but I found that it's been a fun addition to our kitchen.  Though it requires grease, I find seasoned cast-iron just as non-stick as Teflon.  Further, one never need worry about scratching.

Adorable, affordable, SO useful for a thousand reasons
Lodge skillets truly are one of the last great bargains in cookware. I have several pieces in the Lodge Logic line, and they make my heart sing... the non-stick patina that's developed over months/years of use, the substantial heft of each piece, the rustic beauty, and most of all, that unmistakable delicious flavor that only cast iron can impart. <br /><br />I recently added two of these 8" skillets to my collection. I had been eyeing them for my daily single-sized omelets (I plan to wait until the skillets are a bit more seasoned before attempting to cook eggs in them), but every day I think of countless new uses for them. They are perfect for:<br /><br /> - a single, perfect grilled-cheese sandwich<br /> - heating up last night's left-overs<br /> - sauteing baby portabella mushrooms as a side dish for dinner<br /> - skillet creme brulee or blackberry cobbler with ice cream for dinner guests - each guest gets their own perfectly-sized skillet<br /> - quesadillas<br /> - huuuuuge, perfectly-shaped sourdough pancakes, made one at a time (or two at a time if you have two of these handy skillets!)<br /> - crepes<br /> - tapas... get several of these for several types of tapas and serve right in the skillet<br /> - French toast for one<br /> - baked brie<br /> - individual-sized frittatas or quiches<br /> - skillet no-knead bread or cornbread<br /><br />and so much more... I really wish I'd known about these when I was single. I would have eaten so much better! But, they come in so handy as junior companions to my 12" workhorse skillet and my two-burner reversible grill/griddle, I am happy to make up lost time with these little gems.<br /><br />At $10 and change, I recommend you purchase as many as there are members of your family. Or if you're single, buy two... so you can impress dates by serving individual-sized appetizers or dessert! Then ask for two more for Christmas, so you can add a fun, gourmet twist to your dinner parties.<br /><br />As with all cast iron, even though this is pre-seasoned, it's a good idea to season it again yourself before using. Generally you don't use soap or detergent on cast iron (and NEVER put cast iron in the dishwasher!!), but when I first get a new piece, I hand-wash it with hot water and a tiny drop of mild dish soap. Dry it thoroughly with a dish towel... then, to remove any remaining water that has been absorbed, put it on the stove or in a hot oven for a few minutes so that any remaining water will evaporate.<br /><br />Then, coat with a *light* coating of grapeseed oil or organic vegetable shortening. Turn the oven on 400 (or higher, if you dare!) degrees. Put your new skillet into the oven upside-down and line the bottom of the oven with aluminum foil to catch any drips. "Bake" for 1-2 hours. Turn the oven off, then leave the skillets in all night to cool and solidify. Your skillet will have a deeper hue and glossy sheen that it didn't have when you bought it. This will make it a bit more naturally non-stick. The more you use it (or if you want, you can repeat the above seasoning process), the more non-stick it will become. <br /><br />With proper care, cast iron will become your most well-loved cookware. I'm so excited to have added two of these 8" skillets to my Lodge cast iron collection and can't wait to come up with even more uses for these adorable, super-handy little skillets!

Great little pan
My wife thought I was wasting money when I first bought a cast iron skillet, but now she uses it all the time.  She took over the last pan so I bought this smaller one for my omelets.  This preseasoned pan works great.  But don't expect perfect non-stick results on day one; it needs some time to break in.  You will need to use cooking spray and the more use it gets, the slicker the surface becomes.  Don't use soap to clean.  Just use warm or hot water and squirt a little cooking spray on it before you put it away.  Cast iron will last a lifetime and go ahead and use those metal utensils if you wish.

First cast-iron product and absolutely love it
This is my first cast-iron product, and with this experience, I'm buying more... especially from Lodge Logic.  The skillet came pre-seasoned, and no stickiness even from the first use.  The 8-inch skillet (what I bought) is somewhat small if you intend to cook anything more than a single meal.  Will probably buy the 12-inch skillet next and more cast-iron products.  Highly recommended.

Don't pass this up!!
After much research and deliberation over all different types of cookware, I decided to stock my brand new kitchen in my brand new first apartment with Lodge cast iron. Everything I heard about cast iron was awesome, and how can you beat the price for a U.S. made product? You can't! I was so excited when I received this skillet, I made cornbread right away. I lightly oiled it and my cornbread fell right out and there wasn't a crumb left in the skillet! So many of the reviews I read on different Lodge products said that the buyer wished they had discovered cast iron before using stainless and non-stick pans for years and spending tons of money having to replace them. This skillet will last you forever and will only get better with time. I actually love that you have to wash it right away- less dishes to do later! I hand wash everything anyways so the non-dishwasher thing isn't a problem. I love the no soap thing too, saves me a ton of $$ on dish soap since I cook almost everything in cast iron. Just buy a stiff scrub brush! Also, I'm a vegetarian so if there's iron leeching into my food, bring it on, I'll take as much as I can get! I also have the combo cooker (3-qt dutch oven with a 10 1/4" skillet that doubles as a lid- highly recommend if you're on a really tight budget), the 10 1/2" round griddle (great for my boyfriend's bacon, haven't tried anything else yet), and the 10 1/2 square grill pan, I recommend them all! Next on my wish-list is the 5-qt dutch oven and the 12" skillet!<br />Buy this now!!

Perfect pan for everything
I must say that I heartily disagree with Kevin from Las Vegas.  I have used my pan almost everyday for over a year to cook eggs and it works flawlessly.  I also use hot water and a nylon scrub brush to clean it everyday as well.  The trick is to set it back on the stove after cleaning for a few moments to allow the heat from the burner to dry it out completely.  I have found that it also helps to not completely scrub out all the oil/butter from cooking, as this helps to season the pan further when you put it on the burner for a few moments.  And of course, never use soap!  That said, my housekeeper once diligently scrubbed the entire pan clean of it's beautiful, perfect seasoning!  A few rounds of oiling and baking in the oven and it was good as new.  A wonderful almost indestructible pan!

Love It - It Lives On My Stove
I use this skillet so often it basically just lives on my stove. I live alone and usually cook for one, and this skillet is the perfect size for me. I debated between this and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063RWT8">Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 6-1/2-Inch Skillet</a>, and I'm glad I chose the 8 inch pan. I've since seen the 6-1/2 inch skillet in a store, and that would've been too small. My current favorite entree is chicken fried tofu (I'm vegan), and this easily holds two slices of tofu, and will accommodate 3 slices with just a little pushing. So this small skillet lets me fry up 2-3 slices of tofu without wasting too much oil - perfect!<br /><br />I'm a recent convert to cast iron, and I'm cooking more than ever just to have an excuse to use the skillets (in addition to this one, I also own the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008GKDN">Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle</a>, which is perfect for tortillas and pancakes, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JKG9M">Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Combo Cooker</a>, which is perfect for...well, everything else). The sear you get with these pans is remarkable. I frequently saute mushrooms and fry up veggie patties, and I'm still enthralled with the perfect sear on the patties and the lovely browning of the mushrooms. Yum!<br /><br />One note: I personally recommend not cooking with olive oil in cast iron pans. The pans heat up more quickly and get hotter than my other pans, so the olive oil starts smoking sooner than I'm used to. And once it's smoked, it leaves a sticky residue in the pans, no matter how hard I scrub with a brush under super hot water. I'm sure others have used olive oil successfully, but I'm not always attentive enough to keep it from smoking and getting sticky. I've been happily using safflower oil, which is a neutral flavored, high heat oil that cleans up easily without soap.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love this pan, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who's willing to use and care for it properly.

Boy, was I wrong!
I bought this skillet to use as a brownie pan, thinking that it would be too small for anything else.  Boy, was I wrong!  Besides being perfect for brownies, it's also great for making gravy, reheating leftovers, and making fritattas or quiche filling!<br /><br />I found another use for it today: Keeping individual servings of french fries hot! Just heat it up in the oven or on the stove, and put your hot fries on it so they don't get cold as quickly.<br /><br />I used to have a problem with scrambling eggs in a teflon coated pan; The teflon would always scratch and get bits of it in my eggs.  That doesn't happen with cast iron!

Pretty much perfect
As far as cast iron goes, this is about as perfect as can be. Although I always diligently season my cast iron pans after nearly every use, and could get away with a pan that wasn't pre-seasoned, I still think buying a pre-seasoned pan makes a lot of sense because you can get started cooking right out of the box. It also gives you a head start on your own regular seasonings--it takes care of those difficult first 3 seasonings for you.<br /><br />On my first use of this pan, I pre-heated the pan for 3-4 minutes, used a little canola spray (not much) and fried an egg. It slid around just as well as a nonstick pan! Amazing.<br /><br />Of course, what can I say about cast iron that hasn't been said before? It's just brilliant, and I use it whenever I cook meat these days--it just always tastes better. Lodge is as reliable and as inexpensive as I could ask for.

13 dollars? what a great choice!
This is my first cast iron skillet. After trying it out for a couple of months, I totally love it. <br /><br />I find it perfect for cooking one or two eggs in the morning. Because it's so small, it's not too heavy at all. So if you don't like the weight of cast iron cookware, this one is not a problem. <br /><br />Things like eggs got sticky at the beginning, but after several times of use, it became as easy as non-stick skillets. Even better, I use less oil to cook eggs with this skillet. A very thin layer of oil will do the job. Things taste same or less greasy, and it feels much healthier.

Excellent Value
The 8" cast iron skillet is perfect for 2 fried eggs or 1 grilled cheese sandwich. The Amazon.com price (even including shipping) is half the price of the same product at Whole Foods Market.

Worth every penny
I was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet because of previous experiences with poor seasoning - but this one is fantastic. This is now my favorite frying pan and it is very easy to clean. Love it

great quality
I am realy pleased with the quality for the price. I had recently spent $50 and was so dissapointed with another brand .<br /><br /><br />Update------------------------------<br /><br />I'm still loving my cast Iron pan its been over a year now and I just wanted to <br />give 2 tidbits of advice. I have found butter to be better than oil for keeping the pan seasoned. I do wash my pan with a sponge with very diluted soap then I set it over the stove and light the fire for 2 min this drys out the pan to prevent rust and then I add a little butter just when I turn off the flame.I use a napkin and carefully wipe the butter around the hot pan. The heat lets the butter penetrate a bit. The butter does not leave a sticky feeling to the pan like oil does.<br /><br />When I first got my pan I let it soak and accidently forgot about it overnight it rusted badly just in 1 night bud I was able to bring it back to life. I never soak now for more than 5 minutes and only if I must. <br /><br />I also found that scrubbing with salt did not work well at all and was very wasteful. The diluted soap and the above treatment works perfectly.

Great cast iron pan
This is first ever cast iron pan that I have used and it works wondefully. I have used it for omlets with cheese and for making indian crepes and they came out excellent. I was dreading to use it for omlets since I like to mix cheese with egg whites before pouring it on the pan and that always sticks but it did not on this pan. I am planning on buying the flat griddle next.

I have the 10" and the 12" and love them, so I got this little one for when I just want to make ONE of anything. The Lodge Logic line is great, easy maintenance, great cooking results.  The change in taste is remarkable.

Love it
This is one of 5 Lodge cast iron skillets and 4 Lodge Dutch Ovens and camp Dutch Ovens that I own; obviously, I'm a big fan of cast iron, and Lodge specifically.  I bought it for when I want to whip up some eggs or another single-serve meal for myself.  As with my 8 other products, I've not been disappointed.  Just remember to take care of it (no soap, no leaving it wet in the sink, make sure to oil it when dry) and it will take care of you.  I can't imagine not having this small skillet in my pantry.

Lodge Logic Cast Iron Skillets
I love my two new cast iron skillets. I do not know why I have put up with cheap, easily scratched and damaged teflon pans for so long. These pans are solid and well made. They are alrady seasoned when you purchase, and you just need to follow the directions and clean after use, and treat by rubbing in a bit of oil while pan is still warm. That way these pans are as "stick-proof" as teflon, so they are easily cleaned. Make sure the pan is hot before you add food! It's almost impossible to find cast iron skillets at department stores etc. [...].

Great pan for basic kitchen
if you are just outfitting your kitchen, start with this pan. Especially if you are cooking for 2 or 3. The 10" deep skillet is one of the least expensive, decent fry pans available. You can do a dutch apple pie with the lid on in the oven, you can cook eggs, pancakes, french toast on the lid. If you are cooking for 4, and want just one fry pan, get the 12". Otherwise this pan does it all. Roast, fry, oven and stove top. The pans are tough, mine is going on 20+ years.<br /><br />Downside, takes a bit more oil or grease than a Teflon pan, but then if you own a parrot you already know you can't cook on Teflon. Makes you wonder how good it is for the rest of us.

Make this your first cast iron purchase
Simply put, this is the best-designed piece of cookware you will ever use. Chicken fryer, dutch oven, skillet... use your imagination. The 'bottom' half is an excellent deep sauce pan in which you can make a decent sized batch of spaghetti sauce or chili, the 'top' half is a perfectly proportioned skillet. The sides are high enough and have a slight curve so that you can use it as a saute pan and low enough to serve as a griddle. I only have a small hot-plate in my apartment and I use this combo as a stove-top oven. Skillet-side down, it makes great baked chicken, deep side down it makes pot-roast. I couldn't be happier.

Cast Iron Cookware - Great Value
My niece and daughter are great cooks and have a variety of cookware - All Clad, Calphalon, etc.  However overtime - their cookware has not worn as well  -- they both have children and do not have time to "baby" the pots and pans.  I purchased a number of cast iron cookware pieces for them -- they are raving about this cookware.  Heavy, great heat distribution, easy to clean and care for.  So far the cast iron cookware is beating out the competition in value and function. We are purchasing sets for ourselves and also for our other children.

Logic cast iron combo
This is a great product. I use it as often as  I can. I made chili for dinner tonight and i browned the ground turkey in the lid then used the lid to cover it while it baked for an hour. This combo works great as a stock pot, dutch oven, skillet, ect. It can go from range to oven with no problems.

Cast iron rocks!!
I've been slowly and methodically accumulating high $, big-name cookware through Amazon.  I recently saw a Food Network program which featured a cast iron recipe and I was intrigued.  I ordered this item because you get a skillet, dutch oven and deep skillet all in one purchase.  I also bought a few cast iron recipe books.  WOW.... I didn't realize what I'd been missing.  The food is great, the clean-up is easy and the stuff wears like.... well, like cast iron!!!  It's nice not to have to baby this stuff.  I've resurrected a few of my old metal spatulas and the cast iron couldn't care less.  This is a great combo purchase but be prepared to buy a larger dutch oven and skillet later on to round out your set.  All my purchases have been the LODGE brand and I'm very happy with them.  Ready to use right out of the box!!  Buy this... you won't be sorry

If I can do it - you certainly can!!
To preface, I'm trying really hard to be a "good cook" but don't have a lot of experience, and I can't justify spending thousands of dollars on a budding hobby. So, when it came to replacing my flaking non-stick cookware, I researched for months before deciding on a hybrid set of copper-core stainless and Lodge cast iron. I read dozens of reviews and was intimidated by the extra care required by cast iron (I'm a wash-and-wear type). But, Lodge is so cheap comparatively and still really respected as an industry standard, that it's hard to overlook. <br /><br />I initially purchased the combo cooker, a 5qt dutch oven, and a variety of skillets. The cookers arrived in their Lodge packaging and were quite secure, but the skillets definitely were shipped loose. Fortunately they survived the jumbled journey fine, but I can see what other reviewers suffered with regards to skillets scraping each other or breaking out of their boxes - they are only a few steps shy of being insufficiently packaged. Free shipping is a great offer though.<br /><br />The pieces were just what I expected after having read the reviews - heavy, uneven in color/preseasoning application, and rough like sandpaper. Several reviewers I read were upset by sticking of initial cooking attempts, specifically because of the cat's tongue-like feel of the basin surface (which Lodge's website says is a normal condition). Responders suggested a few home seasonings prior to cooking, but I was impatient and followed one piece of advice spefically: go to my local bulk goods store, buy ten pounds of ground beef, and cook it in my new cast iron. I ended up also getting four pounds of bacon for good measure, and spent three hours cooking batch after batch of ground beef and bacon in every piece I'd purchased. <br /><br />The plan worked perfectly - by the time I had finished cooking, drained the oil and scraps, rinsed the pieces with hot water, and towel dried, the insides of the skillets were smooth as satin. The beef fat had left a gray film that made the skillets look instantly "used", which is a benefit I'll have to get used to (not being able to polish them back to a "new" looking state). The bacon stained the cooking surface a bit worse - in bacon-shaped shaddows, but I saved the bacon grease and used it for weeks to brush on the pans prior to use. I've cooked on the cast iron many times since (just dislodged a perfect batch of cornbread this morning), without any sticking during or after cooking. The several weeks of bacon grease was unhealthy, sure, but a great patina starter - I now use a spray or a light brush with butter with no problems. <br /><br />More Pros: <br />- The skillets keep food hot for more than an hour, but yet are not dangerously hot to handle from the oven or stove. I'm going to purchase the handle pads now, but so far I've been using those old loom-woven potholders I made at summer camp with no added discomfort relative to other pans. <br />- The skillets are so versatile! I heat them on the stove to melt butter, toss in some whole garlic cloves, pop in the oven to roast, and bring right to the table for a hot appetizer on toast. They have a vintage-y, industrial charm that allows them to mix and match smartly with existing serveware, and I love the stove-to-oven/broiler convenience. <br />- Food cooked on cast iron really does taste better. I was skeptical because all food tastes good to me, but a few friends and I conducted a "Test Kitchen" on Aebleskiver pans, pitting a teflon against a cast iron. My friends' husbands consistently chose the cast iron-cooked pancake balls citing their crust and flavor to be preferable. <br />- Lodge designed their lines efficiently. The 10.25" lid fits the 3qt Combo Cooker base, for example, allowing me to purchase one lid for several skillets. <br /><br />Cons: <br />- Duh, they're heavy. I'm talking two-hands-heavy. It's a drawback for sure, but nothing's perfect and I know the heaviness is directly related to all the reasons I really like my cast iron. <br />- They're quirky - cast iron doesn't like soap, doesn't like sudden temperature changes, and likes to stay very dry. But, like good table silver, the more the cast iron is put to use, the more forgiving and less tempermental it becomes. <br /><br />I'm back to purchase more pieces, because Lodge cast iron has exceeded my expectations and caused me to take a sentimental approach to cooking - how many Thanksgivings will I reach for this dutch oven?, I wonder. A cook with cast iron in his or her hand is at once an intimidating force to be reckoned with, and a comforting vision of timeless domesticity. Thanks to Lodge (and Amazon!), I can live up to that image with few qualifications and little effort.

Nothing better!
My mom always used an iron skillet - I finally got one and don't know why I've waited so long. Everything tastes better from bacon to cornbread to stew.

cast iron
Thanks to COOKS magazine (sept/oct 2007) we wanted to try some cast iron cookware... I  purchased several pieces from Lodge...and gave them as Christmas presents.  They were all pre-seasoned...and we have been having a blast trying recipes especially written for cast iron.. I believe most (if not all) Lodge cast iron cookware is pre-seasoned thus eliminating a time consuming process..The cookware IS heavy and with proper care, should last several lifetimes. I will definately be purchasing many more items from Lodge

Great cooker
I have this cooker for over a month now. When I first received the cooker, I was really excited and used it right out of the box to cook eggs and fried rice. It was disastrous as everything stuck to the pan. After much scrubbing to get it clean, I heated the pan and coated it with oil. I could have reseasoned it but was too lazy. I blamed this incident on my inexperience with cast iron pans. Subsequently, I only stir fry vegetables with it and repeat the wash and coat with oil each time. After 2-3 weeks, I could fry an egg on it and it wouldn't get stuck anymore. Now, after a month, my fried rice comes off perfectly. So, if you will have patience to get it to season, this is a great pan.<br />No more worries about burning off teflon coatings. The heat retention is great and stir fry vegetables taste much better than other pans. I really love the pan now and know that this pan will last for a long time.

Love it, love it, love it
We use the "lid" every day for cooking something...eggs, bacon, sausage, veggies, etc. It is a great all-purpose pan. The "bottom" pan we use less frequently but, it was still worth the money for the times that we use it to make spaghetti sauce or a dish that has sauce in it. I would buy this set many times over but, since it's cast iron, it should last us for a long, long time. I also have the enameled cast iron and have found that the regular cast iron cookware is more durable and has better non-stick features. I would buy the regular cast iron over the enameled cast iron if I needed to make future purchases.

Such a simple thing...but so great!
I purchased this combo cooker to start my cast iron collection because of the variety of ways it can be used.  I have no previous experience with cast iron, so I am reading everything I can on the subject.<br /><br />It arrived quickly, safely packaged, preseasoned, and ready to go.  I decided to season it again per others' suggestions, but not sure I had to.  There was no rust or questionable spots; I just wanted to be sure it was properly seasoned. I did this by putting a thin layer of vegetable oil on all surfaces and baking upside down in my oven: 350 degrees for an hour.  I let the items cool in the oven.  The surface was a bit sticky afterwards but read on....<br /><br />I made a hashbrown, egg, bacon breakfast casserole in it this morning and was very pleased with the process and end result. I used both the lid and the pot to brown the bacon (to further season my new items.) The cast iron heated up quickly on the stove top using only medium heat.  There was no need to raise the temp higher on my stove.  Then I put all the ingredients together in a 350 degree oven and let it cook for about a half hour.  Great results.  Steaming hot, crispy on the top, sides, and bottom.  No hot spots.<br /><br />The best part was clean up.  It needed minimal scrubbing with hot water, then I sprayed on Pam while it was still warm.  That's it.  And the surface is now MUCH smoother than it was when I first opened the box a couple days ago.  No more stickiness either. <br /><br />I chose this greasy recipe because I figured it would do the best job at furthering the seasoning process.<br /><br />Love it, love it, love it, and I can't wait to try more recipes.  I also purchased the reversible gridle and a camp dutch oven.  Can't wait to experiment with those items too.<br /><br />Doesn't take much to make me happy....

Good cookware
This is a very good product for cooking in the oven. The cleanup is easy too.  I really enjoy cooking with it.

one of my very favourite!
I can't believe people are complaining about this product.All you have to do is to read a booklet that comes with it and follow simple instructions, there will be no discoloration or rust. This pan is very well seasoned. From the very first day I used it the food never got stuck or burnt. This pan works the same way as a non-stick but without harmful fumes of non-stick coating. Cast iron is one of the healthiest cookware to use and you can't beat the taste of the food prepared the old fashioned way. The fact that you are buying not just one but 2 functional pieces is also a great help. Remember that this is an American manufacture, this is very important: a)the quality is tens of times higher than "made in China" b) at this time we should support our economy buying real American products. I own a whole bunch of Lodge products in every size and shape, this is one of their best!

Good set of pans
We have been very happy with these pans.  I really appreciate Lodge's preseasoning.  We don't typically use the two pans together (I have a glass lid from another set of pans that fits on top of these that I use instead), but it's been great to have the two different sizes of pans.

great easy old-fashioned cooking
This is a great product and I am happy with the way it splits up into two separate cooking tools.  I gave my cousin the cover which serves as a shallow skillet and she's been happily using it everyday.  I have not used my deep skillet yet but I plan to cook my next braised stew in it.

I love this set!
I've had this set for a month and a half now.  It was the first piece of cast iron cookware I've used (other then my mom's rarely used one growing up) and I have to say that I am totally shocked by how many uses I am finding for this set!  The "lid" is a wonderful 10" skillet that fits a lot of stuff my old 8" didn't without being huge.  The "base" is great for just about anything, including cooking rice which tends to stick to stainless.<br />I've stopped using all of my other cookware and am using this for just about everything!  I've even stopped using the microwave to heat things up.  Instead I just whip one of these out and I've got a great meal without that "reheated" quality that tends to come out of the microwave.<br /><br />I was worried about dealing with the seasoning (or potential lack there of) that came with it, so I spent some time doing my own.  Here's what I did: I covered the inside with a thick coating of oil (I used an olive / coconut oil mix).  Thick enough that it was coated, but not so much that it slid around.  Then I heated them on my stove top until the oil started to smoke a little then I turned it off and left it overnight.  Then in the morning I heated them up again and let them cool off before wiping them out.  The first thing I cooked was hashbrowns, which probably wasn't the best choice.  It stuck a bit, but nowhere near a bad as my stainless cookware, but as soon as it cooled any remains flaked right off.  The next couple times I chose to cook things that needed oil and haven't had any trouble since.  In about a week of use I had a really nice non-stick surface that has gotten better the more I use it.<br /><br />I have this little tip for those of you that use a hanging pot rack: I tend to wash my cookware as soon as I'm done with it (use HOT water for cast iron!) and then hang them up on the rack to dry, but I found that the cast iron, especially the deep "base", would have a little dot of rust on the inside edge where that last drop or two would lay.  So I took a piece of cardboard (I actually used an edge off of the base of a frozen pizza), bent it a little and placed it in the kettle to wick up that last drop or two.  It works great, and no more worrying about rust!<br /><br />I'd really recommend this set if you are new to cast iron.  You can cook just about everything in these two pieces!

The Best Baked Potatoes You Have Ever Eaten
If you have never cooked baked potatoes in a cast iron dutch oven or a cast iron skillet with a cast iron cover, you don't know what you are missing.  A little butter and salt, stick them in the oven for the greatest tasting potatoes you have ever eaten.  It also works equally as well with sweet potatoes.  This is a wonderful cooker---everyone should have one!!!! Purchased from AMAZON!<br /><br />

Perfect all around pot/skillet
I've been using this combo cooker for about 2 months.  It lives on top of the stove since I use it nearly daily.  I've used the bottom for soups and casseroles. The top is great for eggs or browning potatoes for Sunday morning breakfast.  I've also used to top to make nachos and then re-heat the leftovers.<br />I own some of the high end non-stick cookware and it is getting no use since I bought this piece.  In fact I was disappointed when I realised that I had to use one of the high end pots to boil pasta the other night, I was wishing I had a Lodge Cast Iron piece that I could use.<br />The consistent even heat is a huge plus, especially when working on sauces.<br />The only drawback is the actual weight of the pan.  Cast iron is heavy which makes it such a great cooking medium.  So now I consider cooking a meal another opportunity to getting so weight lifting into my day!<br />I will be purchasing more Lodge Cast Iron cookware, and giving away my high end cookware to family.

GREAT cookware that you can easily make non-stick
This is a GREAT and very useful cookware set. I also have a set of Le Creuset enameled cast iron cookware, which cost tons of money, but I love Lodge since it's so cheap but it's such as great quality. Ideally you use this for sautee or deep fry, since the iron cast allows high heat and good distribution of heat. Food tastes better compared to non stick pans, and it's definitely non toxic.<br /><br />It says pre-seasoned but you might need to re-season it to make it raelly non stick. Put a generous layer of vegetable shortening and stick it in the oven for a couple of hours, then leave it overnight to cool off, then rinse with hot water to clean. Don't rub too hard when cleaning so the coating won't wear off. Re-season as needed, usually after a few months of use. Food will slide easily and cleaning is also easy when you rinse with very hot water.

Terrific
I am just getting into cast iron cookware, after recently dumping my teflon coated stuff.  This Lodge product is great.  I use a little cooking spray and everything cooks great.  Virtually non-stick cooking and everything tastes great.  The top part is good for eggs or pancakes and the larger pot for casseroles.  Stacks for storage.  Easy to clean with a nylon brush and warm water.  Highly recommended.

Look at all you get for the money / get a separate lid
With this set, you have a 10 inch deep skillet, a 10 inch shallow skillet/griddle, a 3 quart saucepan, and a 3 quart dutch oven/casserole dish.  I actually bought a separate 10 inch lid to use as a lid, though; I found using the other skillet as a lid, a bit awkward.  Especially when frying chicken, when you need to be able to quickly take the lid on and off.

Great Product - Perfect for Singles, Couples or Small Families
This is a great kitchen product.  The Dutch oven is the perfect size if you are cooking for one or only a couple of people.  The frying pan/lid is also the perfect size.  Take care of your lodge cookware and there's no reason it should not last you a lifetime.  <br /><br />Also, ignore most of the one star reviews regarding lodge you see on amazon.  Some are legitimate shipping issues but most are varying versions of the following complaints:<br /><br />"I soaked it overnight and it got rusty!"  Yes, iron can rust.  Welcome back to your 5th grade science class.<br /><br />"It was really heavy!"  Yup, iron, of all things, is heavy.  Welcome back to your 5th grade science class.<br /><br />"The handle was hot when I picked it up!"  Hhmmm....yeah, I am trying to remember...oh yeah!  Medal conducts heat.  Welcome back to your 5th grade science class.  <br /><br />Basically, the people giving this one star reviews are people who could not do the work necessary to complete grade school.  That is how dumb/uneducated they are.  Sad that they bring down the rating of an otherwise great product, but unfortunately we have to live with them.  Give this product a chance and welcome to Jr High Science!

Cooking Like A Pro
I LOVE this combo. These pans last forever with proper care. They get really hot.There are certain things you cannot cook properly without cast iron. I have had so much fun learning new recipes. I will be buying more of this brand that's made in the USA. Yes, they are heavy. To me, that's great because I don't have to grab the handle to stir or saute. It's so heavy it stays in place. I can't rave about these enough. I see people complaining about imperfect seasoning. Whatever. It's pretty simple to do it yourself when you first get them and you really should anyway.

Unique does-it-all item
Very versitile and will use forever.. Glad I bought it.. Just don't cook very acidic things in it (wine especially)- it removes the seasoning of the pan..

Excellent Rubber Basketball for Outdoor Play
Ball is well constructed and comes well packaged. Seems durable as well. Note that this is a rubber ball and therefore will be rougher on the hands than an indoor leather ball. I'm happy with it.

good outdoor ball . . .
For an outdoor basketball, grip, durability and balance, are probably the most important considerations.  Spalding's `Street' basketball ranks pretty high in those key departments.  You get a nice firm grip, the durability of the pebbled finish seems to be pretty good, and you get a nice bounce on various types of hardcourts.  The grip may not be as good as Spalding's NBA `Legacy' ball, but it is very close.  Like many outdoor type balls, it may feel a little heavy on an indoor court.  It's reasonably priced, so if you need an outdoor ball, you really can't go wrong with this one.

A pretty good ball
My son gave me this for my birthday and it's been used a couple times a week on asphalt, sun, rain, and snow and still looks new.  The grip is excellent and it feels close enough to a leather ball that you won't be freaked out by the difference.<br /><br />Let's be honest, you need a decent quality basketball for when friends come over or when you step outside and address the 4 for 56 three point shooting streak you are on.  You could use the Spongebob Squarepants basketball your kid bought at Wal-Mart or you can ask for a decent looking Spalding basketball.  I would go for the Spalding.  Even if you can't knock down the outside shot or defend anyone, at least you look good coming and going from the game.

Great balls
The basketball is good in many ways, good grip, great price, great bounce, great size,and great overall feel. The basketball is really good, bounces really well.<br /><br />Don't pass up this ball!<br /><br />The only bad thing is that the ball I received did not look like the picture, it does not have the NBA Commissioner David Stern's signature on it like the picture shows and the descriptions say. <br />The "street" did not look like the picture, it looks more of a ghetto style print "street"..but for sure the ball is great, but I'm not 100% sure of its legitimacy, maybe its some fake spalding import, let me know what ball you guys got, did your ball live up to the description and picture?

it bounces when it's supposed to; the only thing i wished it would do would be to go in the basket more often when i throw it up in the air - but that's not the ball's fault.  nice price for a nice ball.

This is usually the game ball of choice
Whenever my friends play and we have more than 1 game ball, this is the one that usually gets chosen. Not much else to say.... it has a nice, grippy texture, feels well-balanced, and it seems like its pretty durable.

Great ball for my new court....
I recently got an inground pole and backboard and this ballis great on my driveway. I think it is pretty durable and holds air very well. I do not have to fill it every couple of weeks like another one my son had. Also, it is round. I know this sounds funny, but I have seen some that when you spin them up in the air, they wobble a bit. This one does not. I wish I could say I make more baskets with it, but that is a user issue. :-) I can tell you that the grip is pretty good, and I can easily palm this ball. Some balls get too slippery when you get sweaty.

it is pretty good I had it for a few months and it gets the job done. The grip on the ball is really good I had a lot of fun playing with it. NICELY DONE =)

A real ball for the street
After having my 15 year old son destroying many leather court balls and even a rubber one, I decided to give this ball a try. What a difference. It has lasted at least 5 times longer that any other ball on our asphalt court. I have already purchased another one for Christmas even though the first one is still in pretty good shape, albeit only visually worn after over a year of regular use.

Great ball
Great ball for the money.  Have only used it a few times since purchasing, but seems like a durable ball.  I wasn't sure whether to go with a rubber or leather ball.  It was either go with rubber for durability or leather for authentic feel.  But I decided to go with rubber for its ability to withstand dribbling on concrete.  I believe I made the right choice.

Super Grip!
I bought this basketball for my boys.  We have a concrete ball court and this ball so far works great for outdoors.  Super grip.  Hopefully it will stand up and last longer than the other ones we have!

I purchased this basketball to be given to an unknown recipient.  This <br />was a charitable gift.  I do not know how well the basketball performed; however it was well packaged and appeared to be in great shape.

Good ball for cheap!
I went to the park to experiment this ball and surprisingly its actually good for all three stages (performance, advance performance, maximum performance, and professional game ball). Although I bought the performance ball, but after shooting and dribbling the ball for an hour or so, I felt like the ball could reach up to maximum performance level due to the skill level I have acquired.  Once you get use to playing with the ball, you will realize it full maximum capability.  Great price for the ball.

Let's Shoot Some Hoops!
This Lifetime 1221 Portable Basketball System is excellent for small kids.  It arrived within a few days of ordering from Amazon.  Not being a great do-it-yourselfer, I made sure that I had everything I needed before trying to assemble the System:  bought the several bags of sand; made sure I had all the tools as instructed; checked to make sure all the parts were included as listed.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, the most difficult part was attaching the rim to the backboard to the pole all at once.  It took me and my wife and the two kids to get through it, but we made it through the sweat and tears (it was hot that day!).  Make sure you only hand-tighten when first attaching the rim to the backboard to the pole; we forgot and had to un-do all our hard work before completing the last few steps.  We filled with sand rather than water for the system to be more stable, and it sure is.<br /><br />Not really for dunking I guess (but I haven't really tried), and the backboard doesn't provide great bounce, but really, nobody should be complaining about these minor items for this price.  This is my first purchase of a "Lifetime" product, and I am impressed by its good quality, including the assembly instructions.<br /><br />The kids are having a ball everyday... me, too!  Enjoy!

best [...] exercise equipment ever
This is absolutely the best [...] I ever spent on exercise equipment. The package arrived in impeccable condition. It took myself about two hours to assemble the whole thing. It is a ONE person job (I did use a lawn chair to prop it up at the last steps). Pouring 300lb of sand into the tiny whole takes me another 90 minutes, but man, the post is solid as a rock. The bounce of the backboard is ok for a backyard game. You can't expect the NBA stuff for [...]. The frame and rim are very well made. All in all, very satisfied with the product. <br />One tip: I padded the post with a [...] pipe insulation foam from Lowes. Now I don't need to worry about my kids running into the post. <br />

Basketball family
I loved this basketball goal. My whole family loves the goal and I loved the price. The pole is extra sturdy and I was able to put it together myself all my husband had to do was tighten the screws and bolts when he came home from work. The directions were pretty easy except when it came to pictures showing the backboard. I was able to call the customer service line and was helped immediately. Great product and we will have lots of fun with it.

Great Deal and its made well!
[...] shipped...now that is a great deal. I put this together all by myself in about an hour...pretty easy....little tricky for the backboard and rim but can be done by yourself...Messed around with it for a little after and its alot of fun...pretty easy to adjust the height too.   I would HIGHLY recommend this product!!! I am 28 yr old male.

Great product easy to setup
Bought this product after reading a lot reviews on various product.  This one is cheap, the build was good, easy to setup (you need to read instruction).  It's a portable system, it will shake.  I filled the base with sand, so I don't have to worry about it when winter comes.  Overall a great product.

Great Value
This product was shipped promptly.  It was easy to assemble, seems durable.<br />Kids love it.<br />Height adjustment is a bit cumbersome, but for the price, it's easy to put up with.<br />If you anticipate no height changes, this one's a no brainer for the price.

Wonderful basketball hoop!
I purchased this basketball hoop for my son's 5th birthday and he is enjoying it every day.  Since I'd never put one together and my neighbor has put a few together, I asked for his help.  He and I put it together in less than 2 hours.  We follwed the directions and had no issues.  Since we live in the northeast and the hoop will be used year round, I bought dry sand to fill the base. The fill holes in the base could be designed much better, but otherwise the project was not difficult. This hoop is a big hit with my son and his friends.  The quality seems very good and I believe it will serve our needs for quite a few years. I looked at many hoops, and the price, free shipping and delivery to my house really sealed the deal for me.  A more expensive hoop would not have made my son happier. I enjoy shooting hoops with him too!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Basketball Hoop
For a simple Basketball hoop to just shoot around it's perfect. It's definitely not for dunking. It also wasn't that hard to put together. The directions were simple. Basically, it's a great hoop if you're not going to dunk.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
great product
Great product for the price.....I had no problem filling it with water instead of sand, because we live in California and the water will not freeze. Difficult to put together...you need two people for sure...and some patience...but my kids love it
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
sicky
I bought this for myself...and I am a 31 year old man...who likes to shoot some indoor hoops during the winter when its cold and there is nothing else to do. Anyway, I hard mounted this to my wall.....it is not set up for that so you need to take the door brackets off ...and you will need a drill, washers and some wood screws, a stud finder..etc. But this thing is sweet. It is like a real hoop and the thickness of the backboard doesnt matter. i have had 5 hoops before this and this is by far the best one. It will not break even with me taking 18 footers! The only downside is the ball seems a little heavy for the hoop. I am using the ball from my old hoop that is same size but lighter material....than again, i bet it holds up to the heavy ball. Highly reccomended!

Finally, a great indoor hoop!
13 years! That's how many years we have been buying, and re-buying indoor basketball hoops for our boys. Not one has lasted more than a few months - until now. This hoop has a strong backboard and a sturdy metal rim. Now, the rim is not a break-away style, and I assume if there is a lot of pressure or hanging on the rim, the plexiglass-type backboard could crack and/or break. But as long as their slam dunks do not get too out of control, this should last for a good long time. Extra bonus is the rubber padding on the back of the hoop and on the top hooks that hang on the door. No scratches on my front door and minimal black scuff marks after hours and hours of use. I would recommend this product to any "serious" indoor hoops player, especially those who keep buying the nerf-type hoops. It looks good, plays good and keeps my boys, and their friends, entertained during the winter months when it is too snowy or cold for them to use their outdoor hoop.

Finally a great BB hoop!
Finally after 3 cheap BB hoops this one takes the cake! I wish I would have bought this more expensive one to begin with. From the nerf bb hoop that broke after an 1 hour to the plastic rim that broke after a week, this is awesome quality. Its been 3 weeks and still going strong, for a kid who plays hard and dunks. It fits over the door great! I've given 2 as B-day gifts. No cons!

Best Mini Hoop You Can Buy
High quality and a perfect size, this hoop is the best I've seen.  I took the door hooks off and mounted the hoop on my wall.  It works perfectly.  I highly recommend it.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
VERY COOL INDOOR GOAL
This goal was much nicer than I expected.  My dad immediately bought one for my nephew after he saw how nice it was.  The design is great and they thought of all the details (even pads all around the back and the hanging supports that go over the door).  Two things they could have done better.  A little better backboard support because the backboard does slightly bend if you pull on the rim (which I don't normally).  Also, the ball is pretty heavy like a real rubber inflatable ball so I went and found a nerf ball that I like better.  Other than that, it's perfect!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Fun for everyone
This basketball hoop is a smaller version of a real basketball hoop.  It is very well made and the whole family has a blast playing together.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Awesome for the grown man
I bought one of these to put in my office and think I might be another one for my house.  The ball is a real rubber mini ball that has a nice bounce to it.  It is loud, especially coming off the spring loaded rim, but it gives it a better feel.  The one thing I REALLY love about this is that the board is clear, which means you can buy window decals (and place them safely behind the board) to customize the board to represent your favorite team.  This looks real slick.  No one questions why a grown man has a mini-hoop in his office.  Everyone who comes in just thinks it's cool.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
The Perfect Sturdy Mini Hoop
I have nothing bad to say about this mini hoop.  After years of buying cheap nerf hoops, I finally decided to invest in a sturdy one.  The rim spring-back feature is nice when dunking on it.  The rim is also made of metal so it won't sag or break like a plastic one would do.  The backboard has foam on the back to protect your door and minimizes sound from the ball bouncing off of it.  The hoop also has two clamps to hold it onto the door instead of one which increases the sturdiness of the hoop.  The only thing that could make it better would be a thicker backboard but the current one will do.  A great investment and I recommend this to anyone that is looking to upgrade from a plastic/nerf mini hoop.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
A little pricey but worth it.
My three boys lay waste to the average indoor/over the door basketball hoop, so I opted to spend the extra money in hopes of getting a more durable product. It's already outlived every other indoor hoop we've ever purchased.  The boys know they can't hang from the rim and expect the hoop to last, but they frequently dunk the ball and the rim collapses as it's intended to.

Tons of Fun
We bought this for our 11-year old son for Christmas and he has not stopped using it.  It allows for great dunking and is very sturdy.  The breakaway rim is one of a kind and facilitates super dunks.  The "glass" backboard also makes it superior to other nerf rims.  Highly recommend it!

Purchased this for my eight year old son as a gift.  He loves it, it's durable and has withstood almost non-stop one-on-one games with his fourteen year old brother.

A Great Mini Hoop!
Goal is well made looks nice too.<br /><br />My only complaint is the ball it came with. Ball is nice quality but its too heavy and rough for indoor use, you can easily break things and damage your surroundings with it. My advice is to buy a soft ball. Other than that, no complaints!

Great Quality
After several failed atempts at a decent indoor hoop, we finally got it right! My son (9) is LOVING this, he plays for hours, dunking, shooting etc. Its taken a serious beating and is holding up just fine. I looks real too, which is nice. I highly recommend this.

Mfgs Review:  INCREDIBLE!!  Professional quality and real-life play!!  Perfect item.
FROM SKLZ - personal review:  Nailed it with the Pro Mini Hoop!  Professional grade acrylic backboard, break-away rim, solid make throughout. It doesn't break!  It's like real game-play, just slightly smaller and more convenient.  An indoor basketball hoop with the look, function and durability of a pro-grade basket. Mini basketball and over the door basketball will never be the same--goodbye nerf basketball nets. Pro Mini Hoop is perfect for the home, office or dorm. Complete indoor basketball set comes with 5" Mini Hoop Ball.

Great Football
I bought this football about 6 months ago, and it has held up pretty good. I agree, you must have medium-large hands to throw this. It is easy to catch, and you will not drop as many passes. It is somewhate hard to run with though. It holds up very nice, it has no real signs of wear. I recommend it. It takes a while to get used to, but what you do it will be worth it. If you throw right, it will launch a perfect spiral. You can usually hit at least 35 yards, and more if you are stronger. It stays pumped well, and is easy to put air into. However, it is next to impossible to throw if the ball is wet or your hands are sweaty {I was playing a game where it started to rain, I could barely throw it}<br /><br />Still a good buy.<br />
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
The real deal
This is the best football.  Period.  Yes, it can be more slippery than a composite.  But, look at it this way, if you can learn to thrown and catch with these, you are going to be better overall.  My son is a QB who has played youth, HS, and semi-pro and we go outside and play catch regularly and have literally worked with hundred of footballs.  This is our favorite.  It is the right size, and it just has such a great feel and perfect flight trajectory.  You CAN definitely tell the difference.  Also, both my son and I have just normal sized hands and we have no problem throwing.  Anyone who has trouble throwing and believes it is hand size related just needs to put in more time on the throwing.  Heck my son used to throw full NFL size balls when he was 10 with no problem. Technique is a huge part of it.  When I bought this last (we buy 1 to 2 a year because we use and abuse the balls) I bought this one and the best quality composite because we wanted to compare them directly.  There is no comparison.  This one rocks and we NEVER use the composite when we play catch.  We saw a little bit of the coloring come off on our hands in the beginning, but nothing significant.  There is one review on here that would make you believe these things bleed color... that is just not the case.  We originally bought the two balls thinking we would use The Duke in good weather and the composite in crappy weather... but really, we just use the Duke all the time.  Ours is now about 8 months old and it is extra slippery from all the use, so I am on here about to order another one.  These balls make playing catch a pleasure and if you can get over the price (which is not all that bad here really) you will not regret going with this ball.  From the moment you unpack this ball, you know you are playing with the best equipment available.  Love it.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great Ball
Beautiful ball! As a lot of reviews mention, the ball is very "hard". It's hard to imagine pros catching these balls when they're fired out of Favre's  or Cutler's cannon. I would recommend buying receivers gloves if you use this ball more than casually. Easy to grip and fun to throw. Not recommended for children for the obvious size of the ball and the chance of them ruining it on the pavement...

Worth every penny
The moment I opened the box, the leather smell that hit my nose, I instantly knew this ball was made for champions. It has a great grip, feels amazingly sturdy and durable. You haven't played with a football until you play with this one. The box also comes with care instructions on how to bring back the tackiness, if lost. This football is so high quality, that feels like a collectible, instead of an item you play with. Every football fan, collector and enthusiast should get this football, and at $58 it's a steal! And yes, the football feels kinda "hard", but what do you expect? This is no child's toy, this is a 100% Professional level football.  And once again, you haven't played with a football until you try this one!

NO WONDER THE NFL USES THEM!!!!
No wonder the NFL uses them. I received my F1100 NFL ball today and was skeptical at first after reading mixed reviews on this item. I took it out of the box and it was slick and hard. I followed the care instructions for cleaning and restoring the tack, and after wiping with a damp cloth and going over it with a shoe brush it is the best feeling ball i have ever had. The ball is official size so it can be big for average hands, but what do you expect, Its meant for professionals. <br /><br />Bottom Line: I would not recommend this ball for kids, but if you and the fellas are going out for a weekend game of pick up ball I think you will enjoy playing with this ball. My recommendation for this ball is also for high school and up. Not only for the kid looking to elevate his game with and official size ball but also the "Joe the Plumber"{LOL} who only plays on the weekend..

No comparison to the REAL DEAL!
Although it merely sits on a shelf, this Official Game Ball grabs the eye and says, "Now that's a fan!"  Someday, my boys will be old enough play with it, and when that day comes, it will be official; time to get another one, just for me!  For now, it sits next to the TV, with my mini helmets, pleading for all who come and sit to, "LOOK AT ME!"

I'm from The Netherlands so not really familiar with american football (as of yet) but more with real football we play here. But i can savely say that this ball is simply excellent!!! I recommend this ball to everyone in de US as well as in Holland and the rest of Europe (the whole world even), top quality!

The real thing
This is THE ACTUAL BALL that the professionals of the NFL use, so how can you give it anything other than five stars.  This is like driving Jeff Gordon's stockcar or swinging Barry Bonds' bat -- it may not be the most comfortable for you to use but it's the real deal.  If you're buying a ball for a kid, get something easier on the hands.  But this is like having the actual ball that Eli Manning threw and which David Tyree caught with his head.

best indoor volleyball
For the indoor leagues I play in, this is the de facto ball that is used in every match we play.  I know that there are a few other balls that also are popular, but this one is big for city indoor leagues in northern california.  Setters in particular love this ball.  I think the ball used to be softer, so a little break in period may be required to soften it up.

Still the best indoor volleyball
This ball is still my favorite. Every year I get at least one for a gift and playing 3 nights a week it will last about one year. The touch is firm but the ball keeps a true round shape forever. The prices around town and on the web span a lot of different ranges, however you should be able to get this for under $50 with enough hunting.

Such a Good Volleyball that it was Stolen From Me
I belong to a recreational volleyball league and decided to invest some money on a REALLY good volleyball.  Seriously, before I bought this I had no understanding of cost concerning a good volleyball.<br /><br />Having paid nearly $50 for this, I was really hopeful that I would love it (as would my teammates).  When it arrived it was a little under-inflated but it was great-- the leather was soft and no matter how hard I hit the ball on my hand, my arm didn't hurt too much.<br /><br />Yes, this ball was so great that it was STOLEN from me.  I don't know who the jerk is but I hope it was worth it ("Dear V-all Pilferer: YOU SUCK").  Despite having lost the ball, I decided to buy another one, the exact same ball.  I'm still playing with it today and I love it.  This time however, I have written my intials ALL OVER THE BALL with a sharpie.  Obnoxious, yes, but I hate it when people steal my stuff.

Been playing for almost 20 years (yikes) and year in and year out this ball is the still the best indoor ball out there. Great touch and feel.

The finest volleyball I've ever played with
Some A-players call this a 'creampuff', but I haven't found another volleyball that feels any better than this one.  Other balls (esp. Molten) feel like lead sinkers.  I can't stand those things.  The SV-5W Gold however has the right combination of weight and feel for both setting and hitting that it makes for great indoor play.  Some people complain that before they've been broken in that they can feel a tad harsh at first, but that goes away quite quickly.  I think that there is some sacrifice of longevity for the supple feel that this ball offers, so avoid banging it against walls etc. for warm-up.

The new, improved, Tachikara SV5W Volleyball is the best volleyball our volleyball league has ever used.  We've been playing indoor volleyball for 16 years and this is our favorite.  It's light, responsive, well balanced, and easy on the arms.  It stands up to hours of rough play without damage.  We recommend it highly for indoor play at all levels.

The only ball for indoor volleyball
The Tachikara SV5W is so much better than the competition, that it is the dominant ball in all the leagues I have played in or managed.

Nice Ball
This is the one.  Very nice feel and performance.  I've used the colored balls and even though they should be the same, I've always found them harder than the all white ball.  Be careful when inserting the needle.  If there is resistance, start over; if you try to jam it through, you could punch a hole in the side of the valve.  Also, write your name on the ball or else some hoodlum might be tempted to steal it.

This is "The One"
I've been in the sport,,, well, forever. Many styles, (indoors and beach), have been pounded into my face. After many years out of the gym, using AVP balls, I've begun playing in local leagues. The synthetics are lively and easy to handle, but lack the feel and responsiveness of the full leather IMO. I convinced the league players to switch to my Tach SVSW Gold and the response was immediate, they loved it (the ball they were using was a Tach SVSWS). Going from an all white ball to the bright colors was noticeably easier to track and make solid contact with. I would highly recommend this one to anyone serious about their game. I also own two Mikasa indoor leather balls and the Tach has a softer and sweeter response, feels light and "pops" nicely when hammered. It takes a few games to soften up, but you'll love it from day one.

Mine has been nothing but durable.
I have been playing with this ball for over a year (January 7, 2009) and the only problem I have had was a brother in law coming to town and inflating it to 15 to 20 pounds.  I put half an ounce of ball seal it in and have not had a problem with it at all.  I'm looking it over and the end of one of the panels has pulled almost 1/16 of an inch away from the other panel.   The writing is completely gone and all of the panels have a dirt border.  <br /><br />It is durable though you could get a bad one as with any product<br />It is much softer than the $20 Mikasa I bought and played two painful games with - and it is still in better condition.  I hate Composite balls.<br />The double bladder is still holding it's round shape.<br /><br />If you want a less expensive ball the M version is a quality single bladder ball and it feels softer.

Light and Awesome!
I bought this off Amazon. Had a few defects with the colored ones, but returned those. So after playing with it for a year, I realized that not many people in my open gym like this ball. It may just have been my particular ball, but even though I like the soft touch from a hard spike, my friends don't like to use my ball because it is just too light.<br /><br />I have played in club with the molten balls and they are rather hard and at least have some weight. This ball, however, seems like you're not really hitting anything because it is so light. Good thing though (as mentioned by other reviews), is that even after using the ball a while, it keeps its roundness. For me (unlike other reviewers), the panels stay intact over the year I have been using it. But since it is true leather, any scratches my remain on the ball rather permanently, so take care of it!

Soft and Solid...Best Ball Out There
Purchased my first SV-5W ball about 2 years ago and it is the now the ball of choice for myself and my teammates. Love the multi color look and the way the ball rotation is so easily seen. It is, as others have noted, both soft and yet very solid on the big hits. I use the ball about weekly from fall-spring and it has held up great...shows some wear but still in very nice shape. I will order another one sometime next fall or winter.

Best Ball Ever.  Don't settle for anything else!
I played on a team for 4 yrs. in high school, and I have been playing in leagues ever since.  The Tachikara Gold was always our game ball in school, but a lot of leagues have been switching to less expensive models or other brands.  If you have ever played with a T-Gold, you know there is a huge difference.  The premium genuine leather on this ball is unsurpassed when it comes to feel and performance.  Best Volleyball ever!  Don't settle for anything else.  Don't bother shopping around too much either.  Amazon had the best price.

Great volleyball, great price
I've played with many of the competition rated volleyballs available, and my favorite is still the SV5W Gold.  Living in Canada where they cost $70 and up, finding this for $45 on Amazon was a great deal.

Great Stopwatch
Talk about great birthday present! My girlfriend and I go running every night, but with her going overseas for several months, she was looking for some sort of motivation to keep exercising. Not only does this stopwatch measure time, lap settings, and all the rest of that jazz, but it also keeps track of clock time. She laughed about my choice of gift but appreciated being able to tell and track the time.

Great value Timer
This timer is very accurate, easy to use, and has large easy to read numbers. I don't know how it can be sold for such a low price. The guy who could not find the instructions in an earlier review did not look very hard. The instructions are there in every timer. They are printed on the inside of the package material, not on a separate paper sheet. I have had mine for over a year and I am very satisfied. It will be the best ten dollars you have ever spent!

SUPERLATIVES!!! For a High-Function, Inexpensive Stopwatch for All Behavior Analysis!!
This is a terrific stop-watch at a righteous price. It will count hundreth-of-a-second accuracy for up to 1/2 hour, then onward at one-second accuracy. One can make two kinds of tests with the item, but I have only need for one-dimensional measure.<br /><br />I use this device for health-consumer/patient self-managment feedback purposes. This end-- for in-the-hands-of-consumers health-behavior use, this item will compare favorably to the advent of home-blood-pressure equipment and the (array) of new home metering products (for blood-glucose, cholesterol, etc. etc.) This gadget -- and items like it-- will provide the "evidence" for the "evidence-based practice" of patient/health-consumer self-management skills.

My four year old loves it!
We were trying to decide between this and the Dora the Explorer scooter for Christmas.  We finally decided to go with the Razor as it looked to be better built.  It has been ridden on the street, the sidewalk, the kitchen floor and it has not had a single problem.  It is quiet and solid and works as advertised.  I was worried that it would be too difficult for a 4yr old to ride, but the 3rd wheel is just what she needed.  This is a recent revision and includes a nifty feature: it folds up.  My husband was quite happy with this.  Eventually you will get to the bottom of the hill, the kid will not want to push it back up and you will be carrying it.  This just makes it easier.  Just a note: helmut is a MUST.  They can really get some speed going and there is no good way to stop.

Excellent Scooter!!!
I was searching for the scooter for my 4 year old son for a long time. He wanted not the babyish one and I knew this is the one the first minute I saw it on amazon. It's right size, it's 3-wheeler (as I was looking for), it's age appropriate and it looks great. I specifically wanted blue and orange and it came as it was expected. My son loves it and he wants to ride it all the time.

Work Great
My son was happy to be zipping along again on his razor scooter after his rear wheel feel apart after years of use. I tried several local bike shops, Walmart, Kmart etc... and nobody stocks these things. Found and ordered in 60 seconds on Amazon and got a great price as well. He liked the new green color and the smooth speed the new bearings provide.

revive an old scooter
Replacing the wheels on an old scooter is worth it. If you notice the scooter rides rough, take a look at its wheels: chances are they are flat, especially the back wheel because of the brakes. I have replaced the wheels of a couple of scooters (my daughter's and mine), and they are as good as new. All you need is a couple of 5mm allen wrenches. Highly recommended :)

Good Wheels
Perfect for the Original Razor scooter, exactly as described, work perfectly.  Now that I switched the wheels out with the new bearings too, spin a lot more smoothly when riding and go further because there is less resistance in the bearings now since they are clean/new.

Strange reviews - excellent product
I am seeing reviews which do not match the product description. Maybe RadioFlyer changed their model. This is the review against 2009 model I bought for my 19 month son.<br />The product arrived well packed and is heavy. There are hardly ANY plastic parts, all metal. Assembling took some time, though descriptive with drawings but advice you to keep your child elsewhere while assembling! On a serious note - when attaching the front steering wheel, ensure to first put in the wheel bar (U-shaped) and then try fitting the steering handle.<br />Anyways - the product is SOLID and well balanced. I do not really see a need for seat harness if you're purchasing this and your child is already +18 months. There's a bell included but it's very basic and really useless. The color is red and well painted which does not seem likely to start peeling. The seat's good, steering handles are good and sturdy.<br />It's quite easy to steer with 1 good thing - they have curtailed the amount your child can steer - right or left. This means less chances of toppling and when I picked it up - it's very obvious the engineers have kept a low center of gravity. Picking it up for taking it down/up stairs is very simple - provisioning it by a whole in the seat back portion.<br />The parent's attachment is considerably long enough and thus one can easily steer it and push it forward. <br />There are some good thoughts they did - a child can't really pedal but they do tend to put their foot on the pedal. This does NOT stop the parent from pushing the bike. The wheels are free cruising and thus you can pedal forward.<br />Next, the front wheel is 10". That's considerable for this size bike. The tires though plastic look quite solid - front and back.<br />There's a review on the steering concept utilized. I am not sure whether it's for an older model. But there ARE NO CABLES IN THIS MODEL I BOUGHT. it's a gear system, internally located within the pipes connecting back to steering wheels and handle. It's quite stable and responsive.<br />

Great bike for the price.
You cannot beat this bicycle for the price.  It is actually fabricated in the same overseas factories that Giant builds their frames.  It also is the same as the entry-level Chinese-imported Trek frame.<br /><br />As for Mrs. Roberts and her problems......hate to say it, but each and every problem/symptom you described is a symptom/problem indicating a poor assembly and adjustment.  You should have taken the bike(s) to a professional bicycle shop and had the mechanic there do a tune-up on your bike....all those problems would and could have been avoided completely.  Chain shifting problems, chain-drop and jamming, wheel loose....all adjustment and assembley problems.<br /><br />Why do I say this?  I was a bike mechanic for approx. 7 years and saw many, many bicycles bought from mass-market merchandisers and over the internet with the same exact problems after the poor or unskilled assembly.  Even the bikes the "real" bike shops get have to be assembled and adjusted before they are sold.  So, please don't blame the bicycle as being defective, blame the root cause.....the poor assembly and unskilled adjustment of the bicycles.

Great Bike
I searched for my wife a bike and everywhere I went, the price was way more than what I wanted to pay.  I wanted a bike that was well constructed, lite, and has high rated parts on it.  I found this bike and I compared the price with a comparable bike at a bike shop and it was nearly $100 cheaper, plus free shipping.  After we received the bike, we were very satisfied of the product except for the seat, but you can purchase a nice gel seat for around $15.  Great deal!

Nice bike - nice price
This bike is just what I've been looking for: a bike that is affordable, well-built, lightweight and a good frame fit.  Since buying this bike, I've decided to take up biking for exercise and am very pleased with it's performance. Wish I could've picked the color, though.  This bike is a great all-around bike for a woman who wants to ride for recreation and moderate exercise, either on the road or off.

Great ride, getting all you pay for
This bike rides very well, takes bumps well. I really like the quick-release feature for the bike seat and front wheel. This makes it very easy to adjust the height anywhere and easy to pack in the car. The breaks don't jolt you to a stop, they work smoothly. I will probably get a more comfortable bike seat, though, one of those gel ones, though this one is fine, just a little hard for long rides. I have only had it for a month, but am very happy so far.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
pretty darn good overall
I really like this bike.For a regular paved road or a paved trail or gravel road, it's a really nice ride. But not for hard core riders who want to ride off in dirt rocky roads. The gear shifter is excellent and the breaks, awesome! Downside only is the seat. It was comfortable at first but for after 15 min. it was painful but you can replace with the one u like. Interestingly the front wheel can be removable in seconds to store compactly if needed. The bike came with brakes that already don't need tightening and tires pre pumped with air.Putting it together was simple(about 1 hour).The packaged bike was well done too.The box came free of damage which meant the bike was kept intact during the shipping process. The estimated date for delivery was a week early than expected. So I am very happy with the whole buying process and product and might reorder again if needed in the future.

Great wheels!
This was a great purchase! Cost wise and ease of use are tops! It looks great and is easy for a novice to adapt to. Putting it together was not so easy. I paid a bicycle shop $40. to assemble and fine tune and am glad I did because I am confident of the safety. It is not too heavy for street riding or the many hills where I live and for that I am happy. It seems to be very sturdy and trustworthy on the road and off-road and am sure it will last for years with normal maintenance. I always used a men's style Pugeot racing bike but have adapted easily to this style. The middle bar isn't too high or too low and is great for stopping/standing. The kick stand is a definitely plus for my smoke breaks. I good chain or wheel lock is best. Yes, I'd recommend this to a friend or anyone who wants to ride!

Great Mountain bike
I just got this bike for my birthday and its great. The gear shifters are easy and the gears switch nice and easy.The brakes are amazing.The frame is so lightweight which is great for transporting.The front shocks work better than expected, they really make for a smooth ride especially on gravel terrain. You dont have to work that hard in order to go fast, the gears are so easy to change from hills to flat areas. Overall its a great bike from a good brand.You can definatly have high expectations from this product.

It's a decent bike for the $$
I bought this bike because of the price basically.  Not so much because of the Schwinn name anymore because they may as well call themselves Pacific Cycle in China.  This bike is made entirely there with the lower end parts to prove it.  But it's not all bad.  In fact, I have a lot positive to say about this bike.<br /><br />- It's actually very light.  They must use a different aluminum in this one then their other bikes carried by Wal-Mart cause those were all a bit heavier.  It's an easy bike to lift up on my roof racks.<br />- Welds are perfect on the frame and elsewhere.<br />- The pre-assembled parts were for the most part done right and tight<br />- Nice light aluminum rims<br />- Once tuned-up, the v-brakes are strong<br />- COMES with a water bottle<br />- Knobby tires are decent quality<br />- Shimano rear derailleur is not the best but not bad either<br />- Plenty of documentation on how to adjust everything (the v-brakes needed some Googling though)<br />- Very well packaged<br /><br />Here are some things that could be better:<br />- Spring shock instead of gas makes for somewhat unnatural feel<br />- Seat is basic and uncomfortable<br />- No rear rim quick disconnect, only front<br />- Generic front derailleur<br />- Combined Shimano shifters and v-brake handles makes for upgrading one or the other impossible<br /><br />Even though this bike is made with lower-end components, the frame is very light and solid.  When it's all tuned up, this bike operates very nicely.  If you're debating on whether to pick a Schwinn up at Walmart, Target or elsewhere, get it here instead.  I've tested the Schwinns at those stores and they are all a bit lower-end than this one.  Also, I think the $199 shipped is a good deal.  Get this bike if you plan on doing light trail riding or cruising.

I LOVE this BIKE!!!
I got this bike to train for a local Eco-Challenge.  I have ridden it well over 200 miles on very rough terrain.  It is great!  It never misses a beat, and it eats up rocks, ruts, and hills.  I am happy to report that with this bike I won 2nd place in the Eco-Challenge (in the Women's division)!  Thanks Schwinn for making such an affordable tough mountain bike!  I highly recommend this bike!<br />

TWO MODELS = TWO DIFFERENT SIZES
These bicycles are supposed to be "one size fits most" but the two different models are different in size. <br /><br />The light blue one (smooth lines, #S2753) is more like a size LARGE with frame size 19" (seat tube length 19", horizontal top tube is approx. 22 1/2"). Surprisingly it has the same geometry as the male version (also 19"). An average man is taller than an average woman - thus the men's bike should be bigger, right?<br /><br />The silver/purple bike (sharp lines, #S2699) is a MEDIUM size with 17" frame (seat tube length 17", horizontal top tube is also approx. 22 1/2" but because of the head angle the wheels itself are about 1" closer to each other than wheels of the light blue model - beware if you have long feet). The male version of this model has 18" frame.<br /><br />As for my best judgement - I would recommend the light blue bike to a woman 5'3" to 5'11" tall with inseam 28-32" and the silver/purple bike to a woman 5'0" to 5'8"tall with 26-30" inseam.<br />I am 5'9 1/2" tall and the light blue model fits me great.<br /><br />A note how to measure your INSEAM: Stand barefoot upright and measure the distance between your crotch and floor between your legs. Do not use your pant's inseam measurement since different pant styles may result in different measurements. <br /><br />I hope this helps. It is really confusing to have reviews of two different bikes mixed together without knowing which refers to which.

Great bike.  Great value
I am somewhat of an amateur mountain biker.  I purchased this bike for my wife for her b-day.  I bought it because it was the right size and had the right set of features (the Shimano derailleur was the big selling point for me).  Also the Schwinn name seemed to fair better than a Huffy or other.<br /><br />Anyway, the bike is a fair quality.  It is light enough and has a decent build.  It has all the features you'd want: 21-speeds (7 back, 3 in the front) quick-release brakes, wheels and seat, thumb and trigger-finger gear shifters, shimano brand quality derailleur, and a decent front shock.  The front shock is little more than a spring (I'm not sure there's any dampening going on there at all), but it gets the job done.  The brakes are excellent -- as close as you'll get to disc brakes for this price.  I did have to tune up the rear derailleur though because it was skipping.  I'm no expert, but I found some videos on YouTube that helped me figure that task out.  I managed to tune it up so it's working great now.<br /><br />The bike comes in a box and there is some assembly required, but nothing too advanced.  Basically you have to attach the handle bars, pedals and front tire for which you'll need an allen key and a socket wrench.  I happened to have a specialized socket wrench specifically designed for bike pedals, but I think you could probably use a normal socket wrench.<br /><br />Anyway, a little tuning here and there and you have a great bike which is perfectly suited for my wife to use (she's about 5'6").  The seat that comes with it was a bit hard, so I purchased another for her to use which was also at a decent price.<br /><br />On the grand scale of bikes, this bike is a 2 to 3 star bike.  In its price range, it's 5. Definitely.  The wife is happy.  I'm happy.  What more is there?

Schwinn Ridge AL Women's MTB
I bought this bike for my wife to ride and I put it together too. The bike is very suitable to the fitness riding I introduced her to. The bike arrived in great shape and went together easily and quickly. It is an entry level bike and should be understood as such. It has not given us any cause to regret our purchase and is still being ridden regularly also. For the cost and usage, for us, It was a steal! It piqued her interest in riding and helped take the risk out of a potential gamble. We now share quality time together staying fit.

Great Deal
This is a great deal for a pretty good bike. I really don't need anything super-special, so I had almost bought a lower model Schwinn bike from Target for the same price (Ranger?). I'm glad I waited, because this bike is of much better quality. Good suspension for a smooth ride, looks good, easy shifting.<br /><br />Also arrived quickly!<br /><br />Easy to put together, I'm not sure what that other person was doing, but you don't need any power tools to put it together, just a few small tools. It comes mostly assembled and is fully assembled in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Great buy!

Schwinn Bike
I LOVE MY BIKE!  I have had this bike since 2008 and I get stopped and am given compliments on it all the time.  I have been told it is a great fit.  It runs great.  I exchanged the tires for commuter tires for about 20 dollars, and I ride it on average 8-16 miles per day.  I also exchanged the seat for something a little more comfortable for really long rides.  The seat that comes with it is perfect for the average rider.  It comes with a release gear so no tools are needed to adjust the seat height.  The assembly is easy for someone who can follow directions.  (I am lucky, I have a handy boyfriend).  I agree with the other reviews, any new bike should be taken to a bike shop for gear adjustment.  I have only had to do this once before my first ride, and it shouldn't cost more than 10 dollars.  This is a great bike for the price.  Hurry before it is gone.

Had searched all over  the web for a budget good bike for my wife who had never ridden a bike before. I found this one, and after reading the reviews I chose it. I don't regret it.<br /><br />Rides solidly, feels strong, and has been ridden by my sister, brothers, etc on trails following me on my Mongoose Pro Wing Elite, and the Schwinn coped more than adequately.

Recieved compliments on this bike right away
Aside from being affordable and cute, this bike provides a sturdy, smooth ride and can be assembled fairly quickly. I don't consider myself handy, but I can twist some pedals onto a bike frame and maneuver a screwdriver somewhat deftly. That's pretty much all you'll need to put this bike together, besides an allen wrench and some ability to put things together. The instructions are clear, but I didn't even need them. As a bonus, the bike is good looking and elicits compliments from complete strangers from time to time. I don't know what you'll need if you're a hard core bicyclist, but if you're in need of leisure or a bit of exercise such as myself, you won't go wrong with this one.

Strange reviews - excellent product
I am seeing reviews which do not match the product description. Maybe RadioFlyer changed their model. This is the review against 2009 model I bought for my 19 month son.<br />The product arrived well packed and is heavy. There are hardly ANY plastic parts, all metal. Assembling took some time, though descriptive with drawings but advice you to keep your child elsewhere while assembling! On a serious note - when attaching the front steering wheel, ensure to first put in the wheel bar (U-shaped) and then try fitting the steering handle.<br />Anyways - the product is SOLID and well balanced. I do not really see a need for seat harness if you're purchasing this and your child is already +18 months. There's a bell included but it's very basic and really useless. The color is red and well painted which does not seem likely to start peeling. The seat's good, steering handles are good and sturdy.<br />It's quite easy to steer with 1 good thing - they have curtailed the amount your child can steer - right or left. This means less chances of toppling and when I picked it up - it's very obvious the engineers have kept a low center of gravity. Picking it up for taking it down/up stairs is very simple - provisioning it by a whole in the seat back portion.<br />The parent's attachment is considerably long enough and thus one can easily steer it and push it forward. <br />There are some good thoughts they did - a child can't really pedal but they do tend to put their foot on the pedal. This does NOT stop the parent from pushing the bike. The wheels are free cruising and thus you can pedal forward.<br />Next, the front wheel is 10". That's considerable for this size bike. The tires though plastic look quite solid - front and back.<br />There's a review on the steering concept utilized. I am not sure whether it's for an older model. But there ARE NO CABLES IN THIS MODEL I BOUGHT. it's a gear system, internally located within the pipes connecting back to steering wheels and handle. It's quite stable and responsive.<br />

SURVIVED CRASH
I bought this helmet last September.  Excellent fit, very comfortable, light, and good ventilation.  It's protection ability was tested yesterday when I hit a curb wrong and went flying - cracked the helmet & recieved 16 stiches to my eye but no concusion or other head injury... which really surprised the emergency room doctor.  I'm buying the exact same model today as my replacement.

Great Helmet
This helmet was really exactly what I wanted.  It has a good fit and actually looks good on my head.  The cheapo helmets that I was looking at at local retail stores were gigantic on my head (super thick) and I looked like a kid riding his bike in a cereal commercial or something.  This has a much better 'low profile' design and it includes several extra cushioning pads that you can place where you want to inside the helmet.  Very good purchase!

Aesthetically Pleasing!
Was looking for a biking helmet after purchasing a new Trek 1500 this weekend and wasn't sure what I was looking for..<br /><br />I went to Giro's website and read up on the company and it's history and thought I would try to see if I could find an "affordable" helmet thinking that these helmets were more "high end" and that most likely I would end up with a "cheaper" line but I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across one of these at a specialty bike shop for only $35!  I tried it on and with the help of a wonderful sales person in the store had it adjusted to my head!  The color I chose was white and found the fit and comfort of the helmet to be very good!  So...I plunked down my $35 and tried it out that afternoon and love the feel and look!  So for those of you looking for a name brand helmet at an affordable cost you can't go wrong with this line!  Very pleased with my choice!

This helmet literally saved my life
This helmet performed perfectly during a recent bike accident.  I went over the handlebars due to a front tire lockup.  This happened so quickly I did not have time to react (ie. attempt to break my fall).  Luckily I had my Giro Indicator on when I landed on my head!  The shell was scuffed up however it was not cracked.  The styrofoam absorbed the impact and did break up as you would expect.  Even though I suffered multiple injuries (fractured clavicle, road rash, bruising, etc) I did not even have a headache after the crash.  <br />This helmet works.  Thank you Giro.

Great Helmet - Good Fit - Excellent Value
I bought this to replace my aging helmet and was very happy when I got it.  The helmet has a nice adjustable headband (the ratcheting style) and includes extra padding to make it fit like you like.  It is very light and the quality seems high.  I have done a few rides this spring and been very pleased - a sign of a good helmet for me is when I get home and don't really remember having worn the helmet.  And for the price - I think this is a great value.

Light, solid, adjustable and cool
Finding the right fit (online) was something of a mystery to me, outside of finding a tape measure to put on my head. So I crossed my fingers and went with a universal fit.<br /><br />I got a couple of these for myself and my wife. They let through a good amount of air (to keep your head cool), they fit well using the adjustable straps (for front-to-back fit, as well as chin to crown).<br /><br />Design and construction are both great.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Sizes Small to Large
You won't need to worry about this helmet fitting you unless you have an exceptionally large head.  Fitting anyone with  54cm to 61cm  That would be small to Large.  Helmet fits snug without binding and is comfortable, airy and light.  AAA rating in my book.

Great helmet for a great price!
I just came back from a 50 mile ride with the giro Indicator helmets yesterday and they were great!  It's really light and has excellent ventilation.  In fact, my head was cooler with the helmet on rather than off!  The style is also attractive as far as helmets go (I got the black one which looks like carbon fiber a bit) and it fits snuggly on my head even without the extra padding that came with it.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Perfect, exactly what I was looking for!
This helmet is perfect - its light, great color and fits snug. It comes with several cushions already in the insider layer, but if you want to add more there are extra cushions in the box. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a great looking, light, and comfortable helmet.

Excellent!
Bought two of these helmets. Excellent value and product. Very happy with what I received. Comfortable fit, lightweight, and great value. Highly recommended. A must accessory for any biker/rider, from weekender to the serious rider.

Great Price, Strong, Comfortable: No Regrets!
I bought this Giro Sport Bike Helmet and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />In a perfect world, we would not have to wear bike helmets.  But when I started riding bikes again as an adult, I realized that bikes are not what they were 20 years ago.  They are fast!  Getting a helmet seems like a good idea, even for a weekend recreational cyclist.<br /><br />My criteria for a good bike helmet:<br />1.  Cheap - I don't want to spend a hundred bucks - I may get lazy and not ride that often.<br />2.  Able to protect my noggin - potentially save my life in a crash - which I hope I never get in.<br />3.  Comfortable enough that I forget I have it on after 5 minutes of riding.<br />4.  Doesn't make me look like a nerd.<br /><br />This Giro Sport Bike helmet delivers in the first three criteria.  This helmet is very affordable, strong, and so comfortable I forget it is on once I start riding.  As far as criteria number four, well, I guess three out of four ain't bad.

Saved my noggin' and beats the butter out of Bell.
I love this helmet. I actually bought another Indicator almost 3 years ago when I started out riding, and last Fall I was commuting daily to my University about 3 miles away.<br /><br />First off, the fit feels good. It's snug, the snap-clip underneath your chin isn't scratchy or bothersome, and the ratchet in back holds well (and isn't cheap, like the Bell versions - just look at the two).<br /><br />The design provides some excellent airflow. A good sign for me was, when I still had short hair, I'd show up with a miniature "3-hawk" that had to be combed or watered down.<br /><br />More than that, this thing took a beating for me. A mother in a Ford Explorer cut me off one day in heavy traffic while I was going about 30 MPH. With less than 50' between the Explorer and myself, I hauled on the brakes, endo'd, rolled on the pavement, under the Explorer (she had stopped it by then), and then a trip to the Emergency room.<br /><br />My left wrist hurt like hell where I had braced myself against her car, I tore the anterior ligaments on my clavicle and my entire right arm dropped about 3-4mm, leaving me with a permanent bump - but my head came out clear as day and without the slightest dent. Looking back, I can see the scuff marks on the helmet itself and the point on the back where it hit the hardest, denting the foam about half an inch in.<br /><br />Now I'm back buying another.

LOve my Helmet
I got this in Alloy Silver. I really love how it looks. I bike during those hot southern summers and the vents are enough for my head to "breathe". The visor is also an added bonus for me. It helps with the afternoon/mid afternoon sun. Since buying it, I've become quite the fan of Giro helmets. I got one for my husband and I got the Me2 for my baby.

Lightweight and a Perfect Fit
The Giro Indicator is remarkably light. I can barely feel its weight on my head when I wear it. The helmet is a snug fit for my head (my head measures 58.5 cm). Although the product description says the helmet is a Universal Fit for adults (54-61 cm), I'd say if your head is larger than 59 cm, the helmet might be a wee bit too tight; I'd recommend that you go for the next size up.<br /><br />The vents on the helmet are very effective for keeping my head cool. I love its sleek and aerodynamic design, and the Titanium color I've chosen for it.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with the Giro Indicator helmet overall.<br />

Nice helmet at a nice price.
After buying my first road bike I realized I needed a helmet. My budget was $50 or less (at my wife's urging), and after looking at numerous models on line, I decided on the Indicator based on all of the positive reviews. I have to say I have not been disappointed. It fits well, feels comfortable and is very light. I think all bike helmets look dorky when worn but this one is not bad and I actually forget I have it on once I hit the road. The bottom line is it protects my head and for the price paid I feel I got a great deal. If you want a decent helmet that won't break the bank, give this one a try.

Saved my coconut once already
This is my second Giro Indicator helmet.  I was wearing the first one when I had a crash while rollerblading downhill.  I fell backwards, and the back of my head smacked hard into the pavement.  Without a helmet, I would have been lying unconscious in the travel lane of a state highway.  With the helmet, I had no head injury.<br /><br />I replaced that Giro Indicator by a Specialized AirForce helmet.  It didn't fit me nearly as well as the Giro, so I decided to pitch the Specialized and buy another Giro Indicator.  It fits me perfectly.

saved my head
I had a wreck 3 weeks ago and the helmet did its job.  My head hit the pavement on a fall during a training ride.  The foam cracked instead of my skull.  Many thanks to Bell for making a reasonably priced and effective product.

I have a big head...
...and could never find a decent helmet. All the others pinched the side of my skull as if they expected me to have a peanut shaped noggin. Then, one day as I was admiring the gray hairs starting to sprout on my sides I realized my head was not spherical but that I had a natural bump on the right side. I'm no phrenologist (i.e., head bump reading fortune teller) but I could tell this helmet was in my future, snug, light, unobtrusive and stylish. Moral: knobby, big headed cyclist stop here.

GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY.
I don't like to wear a helmet.  If you are smart you will.  The Bell Radar is light, comfortable, stylish and inexpensive.  I don't plan on seeing how it will hold up under a crash, but based upon the design, it should.  If I were riding in the mountains, or needed extra protection, I would upgrade to one of Bells more expensive products.  This one will be fine for me.

Do I have to wear this?
That is what I said when I was told that I should get a bike helmet when I decided that I wanted to get a bike. But I am so happy that I followed my friends advice and ordered it, it came to me quicker than my bike did, I put it on and the fit is great and I even fell off my bike and my head hit the ground and it was well protected. I happen to be in the store to get a bag for my bike and I saw a Bell helmet and it was way more expensive than what I paid from Amazon. Thanks for the savings.

Worth every penny
For the price this helmet was well worth it.  It fits nicely and is lightweight.  I have a large head and it was easy to adjust properly.  Its just a good basic safetly helmet and i also like the design.

why pay more?
i'm seeing extremely similar helmets in store that cost 3 to 4 times as much.  the helmet looks nice, fits nicely and protects just like any other helmet out there.  I wouldn't waste your money when this gets the job done.

Saved by the Bell!
After I reconditioned my 35 year old English bike, I thought that I never used a helmet before, so why start now. But my wife insisted that I get a helmet so I looked for an inexpensive one on Amazon. The second time I road my bike, I went flying over the handlebars and totally wiped out. If I wasn't wearing my Bell Radar Bike Helmet, I'm quite sure I would not be writing this review. Bell - I won't leave home without it!!

Great light for very little money.
I am the type of person who reads the reviews before buying something. I read many reviews on several bike lights. I knew what I wanted to spend and started reading about the lights in my price range. Many of the reviews of this light complained about the way it attaches to the handle bars. I found that this was not a problem. This may be because my Cannondale has thicker handle bars than some of the bikes in the reviews. I am not sure, but it fit easily and securely. The other complaint was about the strength of the light. Most reviews claimed that you would not be able to see very well on a dark trail, but that it was sufficient in a lit city. This is not really the case. I bought two and mounted them easily on my bike. I ride on dark trails at night and have found that even when riding fast I can see really well. This is true even with only one turned on, though I prefer both on at the same time. They don't light the trail like my Honda CRV, but it is plenty bright. Once while riding through the city I had the lights on strobe so that cars will notice my presence better. They are pretty bright and really show up in the reflective surface of street and stop signs. Two motorcyclists riding in front of me saw this strobe effect and pulled over, only to realize that I wasn't a cop. They were probably drunk, but that is still pretty bright. I am glad I chose this light. The battery life is also great, especially with rechargeable batteries. As for the people out there bashing this light, yeah it probably isn't as powerful as one of those $300, $400, or $500 bike lights. However, this light was $32 and more than does the job. If you are looking for car or truck headlight performance, you are not going to get that with a $32 1 watt LED. If you want a very good and reliable bike light for riding at night in and out of the city, this light is gives great bang for the buck! Hope this helps!

Good light and Good Mount (ignore contrary reviews)
I have both the one-watt Blaze and the 5-LED Beamer lights on my bike (note that I am comparing the one-watt Blaze, not the half-watt Blaze). I use the Blaze for constant-on illumination (to see) and the Beamer as a blinker (to be seen). <br /><br />First of all, there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THE MOUNT (which is the same for both lights). Please ignore other reviews to the contrary, which were posted by people who are apparently unable to read an instruction sheet. <br /><br />The mounting strap is ADJUSTABLE. It will accommodate very small handlebars, as well as massively oversized handlebars. If you turn the mounting bracket over and examine the underside, you will see that the mounting strap has ratchet-teeth. There is a keep directly beneath the mount which holds the strap to the desired length. If the mount is too loose, push the strap towards the mount to ratchet it to a smaller size. If the mount is too tight, use a small screwdriver to hold the keep up as you let the strap out. The mount may be further adjusted by turning the set-screw (by turning the cam-lever). Don't make it too tight, or it will be hard to adjust vertically. <br /><br />The mount is very secure, yet the lights are easily removed (and can easily double as a flashlight when needed - and you could easily hold it in your teeth for roadside repairs). <br /><br />Photos of both the Blaze and the Beamer look rather similar - I wondered if they used the same plastic housing. But the Blaze is substantially larger than the Beamer (in both length and diameter, even thought they both use the same size (AA) batteries). As I said before, the mount is the same. <br /><br />In blinking mode, the Beamer is actually brighter (overall) than the Blaze. This is because the Blaze (wisely) does not flash at full-intensity all of the time (otherwise you would absolutely blind passing motorists). The Blaze mostly flashes at low-intensity, but every sixth or seventh flash is at high-intensity. The Beamer flashes at maximum intensity with each flash, which is brighter than the Blaze for most flashes, but not as bright as the occasional max-flash of the Blaze. Overall, the Beamer is brighter in flash-mode, although I am not sure it is better. But it is sufficient for my needs. <br /><br />Many bike lights are designed like flashlights, where the beam is really visible only from the front - someone viewing from the side would not see any light from the bulb itself (only the things that the bulb illuminated). Both the Blaze and the Beamer have lens bezels which fully expose the bulb to aspect view, giving these lights about 210-degrees of visibility. <br /><br />In steady-on mode, there is really no comparison in lighting intensity. The Blaze has a high and low mode for steady-on, while the Beamer has only one steady-on mode. My comparison is only using the Blaze in high-mode. The Blaze's intensity is why I give it five stars (I gave the Beamer only four stars because it was lacking in comparison).<br /><br />The Beamer's steady-on mode is rather hazy and unfocused. The five-bulb light source can be seen in the uneven lighting it produces. The Blaze (which has a single bulb) produces a much whiter and brighter light which is highly uniform. I'm not sure I would recommend the Blaze for absolute pitch-dark riding over difficult surfaces (such as singletrack wilderness and mountain trails), but it is perfectly sufficient for fill-lighting in urban commutes, with occasional very-dark spots. The Beamer is sufficient only for urban fill-lighting - I would not want to use this light in very dark conditions. <br /><br />If I found myself riding an extended bit of pitch-dark road, I would reconfigure my lights to use the Blaze as a distance light and the Beamer as a close-in light. <br /><br />Some posters complain that NiMh rechargeable batteries are inferior to alkaline. I am not able to discern any difference in the Blaze. NiMh batteries are 1.2 volts, whereas ordinary batteries are 1.5 volts. However, it is not really voltage, but milliamp-hours (mAh) which determine a battery's power potential. <br /><br />The Energizer e2 MiMh batteries can be charged to 2,450 mAh (milliamp-hours), while fresh Energizer Alkaline batteries are rated at 2,850 mAh.. So the difference in power is about 8.75%. I cannot perceive this difference. However, a freshly-charged MiMh battery will ALWAYS out-shine a somewhat-discharged (but still relatively new) alkaline battery. There is a temptation to use disposable alkaline batteries until they are absolutely worthless - thereby depriving ourselves of good lighting (few people toss out batteries because they are only at 91% power - the point at which fresh NiMh batteries exceed their 8.75% discharged alkaline counterparts). It is better, IMO, to have a slightly inferior battery that I can recharge each evening, so I always have an absolutely fresh battery, rather than a disposable battery that may be slightly brighter for the first hour or two, but soon looses ground to a freshly charged NiMh battery. <br />

A very good light.  At the price and weight, an excellent light
I ride on rural roads with kangaroos on pitch-black moonless nights.  <br /><br />I have had this light for one week. It scares kangaroos.  Truck drivers dip their lights.  Motorists slow down and move over.  <br /><br />At a distance of about 20 metres (say 60 feet) the beam is wide enough to light up the whole road.  It will pick out reflectors on road side posts at about 400 metres (say quarter of a mile).<br /><br />The mounting is stable, secure and easy to adjust.  The on-off switch is easy to use, even with gloves, and has good tactile feedback.  The side illumination is good, to ensure visibility in urban streets, without light shining back into the rider's eyes. <br /><br />If you want to look into the beam, get some welding goggles.

Surpassed expectations
When I was bike commuting 14 miles every morning in the dark, I needed floodtides of light ... and I spent big bucks to get it.  Now I'm older, wiser, and have scaled back the morning ride ... taking the bus most of the way, but riding all the way back in the afternoon. So I needed a good, strong light for two short jaunts ... one to the bus stop and another from the drop-off point to my office ... about a mile each. And the roads were lightly traveled, but dark.<br /><br />Not wanting to shell out the hundreds of dollars I had in the past, I tried some of the cheaper lights ... all of which were very disappointing. But after reading the reviews on this Planet Bike 3044 Blaze 1-Watt LED Headlight, it seemed worthy of a try.<br /><br />And it exceeded my expectations by a long shot ... providing a strong beam ahead of me right where I need it, with reasonably long battery life. It also provides enough light from the side to be seen, but doesn't shine in my eyes, as some of the other models did.<br /><br />Nice to have two levels of lighting, and also nice to be able to turn on the strobe flash ... great for overcast afternoons on the way home ... or just to enhance my visibility to anyone in front of me.<br /><br />A great value for short rides in the dark.

A Great Light
This is a great light for the price but possibly more suited to the recreational rider such as myself.<br />It has three modes low high and flash although the difference between the low and high settings is not great.<br />You will need a rubber strip inside the bracket to prevent it from moving this is not supplied at least there was none with mine.<br />I found the fitting of the bracket somewhat difficult it consists of a ribbed strap which is pulled through a slot and locks into place but it would not lock on the last two ridges, I assume that was because my handlebars are a small diameter but, with the use of a rubber strip providing an increase in diameter and a good grip it was much easier, it can also be tilted without becoming loose.<br />The light is quick and easy to remove for security.<br />The bracket can only be fitted facing in one direction as the light only slides on in one direction, that seems an obvious comment but it is easy to get wrong when you're fitting the bracket without the light attached.<br />It was delivered on time and well packaged.<br />I considered 4 stars because of the bracket fitting problems but those may be specific to my bike and were solved with the rubber strip plus fitting the bracket is probably a one off for most people.<br />

Brightness to price ratio is a winner
I've gone through 4 different bike lights, and this is by far the best value.  It is the most expensive of the 4, but the performance is easily the best deal.  Mounted on my bike, this light overwhelms a Schwinn 3-led light that is shining in the same area.  In fact, when I turn off the Blaze, the Schwinn seems almost dead in comparison.<br /><br />Uses:  As others say, this light is great for both seeing and being seen.  The light is almost a spotlight, but the light radiates about 10 feet away from the focused beam point.  I aim the light to a spot about 30 feet in front of my bike, which gives me good visibility of the road and also positions the light for good sighting by oncoming drivers.<br /><br />The mount works well.  Some users say it is too big, but it is actually adjustable, the package contains some written directions on how to adjusts to your specific bar size.  Another good point to this light is that you can buy separate mounts, so you can switch the light quickly to another bike if you want.<br /><br />I've seen other user comments about no difference between high and low steady modes.  The difference is noticeable to me, and I believe that low mode gives extended battery use.  My requirements for lights is usually limited to about 30 minutes at a time, so I always use it in high mode.<br /><br />On black highways in very dark circumstances this light lets you see the road.  If you are the type that rides on the sidewalk it will be even brighter.  If you have very bright street lights, you may have just minimal improvement on your visibility.<br /><br />Last good feature is the ease of changing batteries.  I have 2 other lights that are really awkward removing batteries.  One 5-led Cateye light, which takes 4 batteries, I have to bang on a hard surface to remove the lower batteries.  I also have a cheap Bell light which, when I attempt to remove the batteries, the light sometimes falls apart.  This Blaze is so easy, just open the top and the two batteries pull straight out like a flashlight.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Excellent for my purposes
I use the Blaze on those days where I can't get out to ride before dark. After the sun goes down, I ride urban bike trails, which are generally unlit. This light is perfectly adequate and illuminates the trail sufficiently at a maximum speed of a 20 mph. Because the light snaps into its mounting bracket, I was worried that there might be some shaking, but I haven't noticed any vibration even on the short sections of the chipseal roads I ride.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
economical front headlight
This light is very well made as is the clamping mechanism. One drawback is that a handlebar bag obstructs the light beam. But that is not the fault of the light. I fashioned a bracket out of a metal rain gutter strap and mounted it off the handlebar stem so the light sits just above the fender on my touring bike. It works great there too. The beam of light is enough for riding on roads but don't expect to light up your back yard with this light.

Excellent bike lamp
As good as they get, unless you step up to the >$100 range.<br />Smaller than expected.<br />No problem attaching it to the bike<br />Bright enough to see by, if you  have young eyes like my daughter.<br />Not had it long enough to judge battery life

works great!
Very happy with this little light.   I've been using it for commuting and it works great even on some really dark trails.   I may end up picking up a second one eventually so I can direct one for closer distances and the other for further out, but it already throws a pretty wide beam.    Great light.

easy to attach; lights up bike path
I got this light for my kids and myself. It works great. Once you figure out the adjustments the mounting system is easy and flexible. There are 2 ways to adjust the size of the clamp and can be put on a variety of tube sizes.  the light is bright enough to light up the way in front of the bike. I have no complaints. this seems to be very good value for the money.

Great light!
I got this to replace my Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED light when I got a new bike. With the single 1 watt LED, it's considerably brighter than the 3 LED Beamer, but the battery life is still excellent. I sometimes put both on my bike, with the 3 LED Beamer aimed a bit down for near field light and the 1 watt Blaze aimed forward for visibility and far field illumination.

LIKE RIDING IN THE DAY!
Just got my blaze 1 watt light. Rode home tonight in the pitch darkness, with no street lights at all. I'm thrilled - I have total confidence now, that I can see the road with eaze, riding 16 mph.  Fantastic, stable and easy-to-use mount.  And a great price.   Once you try this, you'll realize that old standard halogen bulbs are obsolete.<br /><br />By the way, this works fantastic in combination with a Planetbike "Sport Spot" light mounted on your helmet. That's my conbination now.  Would recommend this and the sport spot to anyone.

LED Bike Headlight
I now own three Planet Bike products and couldn't be HAPPIER! I only have an old Cateye light to compare the new LED one against, but what a huge difference.  The light has three setting, low, high and flashing. There is some difference in the low vs high and if you are in some really dark place (trail) I'm sure it would help.  I use the flashing mode for riding on the street and it pops off the stopsigns at half a mile away. I don't have any signs more than the half mile by the house to check if it can be seen a greater distance. The light came with everything, just added the filler rubber pieces to make up the size difference and adjusted the bottom screws to finish it off and that was it. Having owned all Cateye lights, computer, etc and seeing the difference in Planet Bike items, I wouldn't waste my money on the Cateye again.  The Planet Bike Wireless Bike Computer works great too!  It is sealed, haven't got rained on yet to test out the seal, but from the looks of it there shouldn't be any problems.

Fantastic, Bright, and Cheapish
I have owned this light for about 6 months and it is fantastic. During the day you can put it on Super-Flash mode and been noticed by drivers. During the night put it on High or Low mode and you have a decent spot light in front of you that will light up the street signs two blocks down. Now I do wish it was a little brighter, and a touch wider spot light, but there really isn't any more I can as for from this light.<br /><br />The mount is just fine, I use it on drop bars that have a changing diameter so it actually doesn't clamp on to well because of that, but that is my fault for mounting it there. Even so it stays where I put it and works great. Love this light!

Puts out great light!
I had a 5 LED headlight before, but when I was in a very dark setting, I found it difficult to see ahead.  With this 1-Watt LED, there is a significant increase in the amount of light it puts out.  I can now ride with confidence on the very dark portions of my ride knowing I can see the road well.  Highly recommended for those who ride in dark settings and need enough light to see what is ahead on the road.

Incredible brightness for the price
This light performs incredibly.  The cast distance and width is far for what your paying for.  Everyone who rides at night needs to purchase this light.  I can illuminate reflective signs from over a block down.

Great
This light met my expectations. It's not the light you would use to make an expedition, but it's perfect for riding through the city.

Great light!
I was hesitant to pay twice as much for this light as a basic front light, but it turns out to be well worth it. For various it is much more important to me to have a strong front light than a strong rear light. You can tell this is strong because it lights up stop signs blocks away. The attachment is the same Planet Bike uses on all its front lights, so if you have one laying around you can use it on your second bike and never have to fuss with taking it on and off, which I find convenient. And Planet Bike is a swell company that gives a portion of their profits to bike advocacy.

Excellent bike for the price
I recently purchased the Sunny Health & Fitness Pro Indoor Cycling bike.  I've used it a few times and I'm very happy that I went with this bike.  I can't talk about other comparably priced bikes on the market ($250-$500 range), but I don't think you can go wrong with this particular bike if you're not looking to spend over a $1000 on a decent spinning bike.  <br /><br />I'm not a hardcore spinner, but I've gone to enough classes at different gyms to know that this bike performs just as well as the $1000+ ones I've used at commercial gyms.  It has the same feel as those bikes, and that's something I wasn't sure I'd get in a bike that cost far less.  <br /><br />Here are some bullet points on the bike:<br />-Quick delivery<br />-box was a little torn in the corners when I received it.  I recommend opening it up and checking on it's condition.  I actually sent back the first one I received because I felt bent metal when I reached in the torn hole.  However, I decided to open up the second one and discovered that the bent metal was a "protective piece" to prevent damage to the front of the bike.  Just be careful when you open it just in case there is a problem and you have to tape the box up and send back!<br />-I'm 5'11" and 190 pounds and I had no problem adjusting the seat and handle bars to get to a comfortable and proper riding position.  <br />-the wheel spins smoothly and the resistance is consistent and ample.  The breaking lever works great as well.  <br /><br />I bought a magnetic resistance bike a few years ago and it's currently dismantled and collecting dust.  If you're undecided between the two, take it from me, go with the "spin class" type bike!  You don't need a calorie or distance counter...if you don't feel like you're working or not sweating, you'll know it.  If you need a heart rate monitor, go with one of the watch ones...they're more accurate than holding onto a cardio machine's handlebars to get a reading.  <br /><br />Overall, 5 out of 5 for this bike.  I'm sure more expensive ones have more options or gadgets that may be useful for the hardcore spinners, but if you're like me and into spinning but don't need the extras and the added cost to get them, then go with this bike.

Nice spin bike for the price.
Received bike in less than a week.  Package arrived in good shape, no defects noted.  Assembly took less than an hour, no adjustments required.  Good quality for the price, almost $200 less than comparable bikes I've seen in stores.  Replaced seat without even trying the one provided, my preference.

Amazing value from a first time reviewer.
First, let me start by stating that I don't usually write reviews but I feel strongly about the value of this product.  Many of my friends mountain bike and participate in "SPIN" classes.  Being avid cyclists, we would rather spend our money on new bikes or components.  Price has always been a barrier in owning an Indoor Bike.  Stores like W*L M*RT carry indoor bikes for about the same price.  Their bikes are much lower quality.  I have never considered purchasing an indoor bike because I was never aware of deals like this.  Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across this deal.  I always trust Amazon for honest user reviews and knew this would be a good deal based on the 4* reviews.  I had high expectations for this bike and I was not disappointed. The build quality is solid!  This bike is 106lbs.  It will take two people to get this into the basement.  Take a look at my user submitted picture for building tips.  I placed aluminum tape at the base of the handlebars as suggested by another reviewer which made the bike rock solid.  Buy this bike.  You will not be disappointed. Those looking for a good video can't go wrong with [...].  I tried several videos but found this one the most entertaining.  At $10, you can't go wrong.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Great spinning cycle for cheap
I mountain bike as often as I can but the winter is usually a little harder to get motivated.  I wanted an indoor cycle that was cheap and well built.  This is the one!  You can't beat this bike for the price.  It's really pretty easy to put together (if you can move the 1000 pound package) and works great.  Yes I would change a few things like have a nicer handlebar/armrest, add a computer, etc but for a low price indoor cycle, you really can't ask for anything better.<br /><br />The wheel is obviously very heavy and offers a huge range of difficulty with an easily adjustable knob.  The seat is actually comfortable to me, but I'm used to moderately narrow saddles.  The pedals are adequate and you can simply install your own pedal preference if needed.  The base is plenty sturdy even on carpet.  The handlebar post and seatpost have a small amount of play to them but you don't notice the wiggle at all when riding.  Adjustments to a multitude of positions are easy to make.  All in all, this is the one to get if you want the cheapest and well built indoor cycle out there.  Free shipping from amazon for this brute of a bike is a nice perk too!

good bike fot the price
So got this bike because I did not want to spend another winter not riding. I am not a road biker but just someone who loves to ride my bike all summer. Was thinking about getting a trainer and decided on this bike. Arrived super fast, easy to put together they supplied the tools in the box. Recommend putting a little bike grease on the handlebar stem because it is a little snug but the grease worked great and it slides up and down with ease.<br />It's quiet, and my friends are jealous. Honestly for the price it is a great deal! I'm not bummed about the snow coming now knowing I will be riding all winter :)

Rock solid spinner bike, fantastic for the price
I'm amazed at how solid this bike is. Nothing about it feels cheap, other than the price.  The 40 lb flywheel is usually only available on the very expensive spinner bikes, and it's so nice to have what feels like a high-end bike at a fraction of the cost.  I agree with the others whom had complained about the seat not being comfortable (and I don't know that the ones on the higher-end bikes are), and I replaced it with a nice big comfy seat from Bell for $30. At 5' 10'', the seat height is fine, and I keep it on level 3.  My wife, however, being 5' 4'', considers it *almost* too tall on the lowest setting.  I'm very glad to have found this deal on Amazon.  If it turns out that the bike doesn't last for some reason, or if I turn out to not be using it as much as I hope to, I'm not out of a huge expense.  For anyone thinking about getting into spinning, I honestly don't think you can do better than this unless you're looking to really lighten your wallet.

Great price, great bike. Don't waste money on a more expensive bike!
I had a more expensive Spinning brand bike in my cart and went to purchase when I saw this other bike suggested by Amazon. I checked it out and, after reading good reviews, decided to save $200 and go with this brand instead. I am VERY impressed. I am a group cycling instructor and have used several types of bikes and this bike is great. You really get more than your money's worth on this piece -- I recommend it to anyone who is looking for one inexpensive piece of home cardio equipment. It definitely feels more expensive. It's sturdy and comparable to the bikes I used in gyms when I teach. The assembly wasn't terribly hard (about an hour) although the directions were slightly confusing. Still, no meltdowns.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great Investment!!!
I researched many different brands, reading countless reviews until I finally settled on this spin bike.  What sold me in the end were the many reviews I read about the sturdiness of the bike, the weight of the flywheel and the overall value.  I was not disappointed!  I absolutely love the bike.  It is just as sturdy as the bikes I have used at the gym. It's quiet, smooth and offers a powerful workout that you would expect from a higher priced spinning bike.  Combine it with a spin dvd and you've got a club quality workout at home!

Great Value, Great product!
We received this within 2-days via Amazon Prime shipping, and it was much easier to assemble that I thought it would be based on the other reviews I had read.  The bike basically comes fully assembled, you just have to attach the front and rear bases, pedals, handlebar, and seat.  Unpacking and assembly totaled maybe 40 minutes with no problems at all and all required tools were included.<br /><br />Bike is very sturdy, feels very solid and high quality.  It comes with floor levelers to make minor adjustments to make sure you don't have any wobble.  Bike has good seat and handlebar adjustments and provides a very good workout.  The pedals come with adjustable foot clips to hold your feet in and these work well.  The only thing I ahd expected was some sort of timer or monitoring to track my workouts.  The bike does not come with any electronics at all but I suppose this can be added.  Overall a very good bargain compared to some of the $700-$1000 bikes we had seen in local retail stores and I would highly recommend.

Great cycle for the money.
Very solid and comfortable.  Every bit as good as the spin bikes we had at the gym.  Even with high tension and stand-up pedaling, this bike does great. The pedals have straps..but they work fine for me.  If you're looking for a great way to work-out at home without a huge investment, this is a great way to go.  It was delivered within two days and my husband put it together in less than an hour.

LOVE IT !
I love it, I really took my time and looked for the best bike for the best price,I read so many reviews. This is a great bike , well made, strong and very easy to put together. If I could say anything bad it would be: you have to change the pedals to 'clips' and no water bottle holder.

Fantastic ! - Better than expected
I don't have any other comparison, since this is the first I have ever purchased, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it just two days after I ordered with FREE shipping.<br /><br />The trainer itself is solid and works better than I could have hoped for, cost a lot less than buying an exercise bike.<br /><br />I am not a cyclist and bought this to simply turn a regular bike into an exercise bike.<br /><br />There was zero assembly required, just unfold it and place your bike in, super easy, when you want to ride the bike out on the street, it's free in less than 30 seconds.<br /><br />The only con I would say about this, is that it is loud if you have nobby treaded tires, from the previous review, I can see how a smooth tire would quiet it down, You do or can get use to the noise of it, However, you can also release the tire from the tension roller an ride like a regular bike.<br /><br />Highly Recommend, I don't think you'll be sorry on this one.

Considering The Very Low Price The Bell Trainer Is Near Perfect
There are trainers with more features than the Bell but you will pay a lot more. If you are new to indoor biking then the Bell Trainer is the perfect way to start. You can always upgrade to a $500 trainer later if you feel the need. There is no adjustable resistance mechanism on the Bell. You adjust the resistance using your bike's gears. Simplicity is a good thing IMHO! Some reviews have complained about noise. I've heard noiser Trainers than the Bell. My exersize cycle makes way more noise. In comparison the Bell is rather well behaved in that regard. The build quality on the Bell is VERY solid. The bearings seem to be of high quality. The flywheel is machined and polished steel. It comes out of the box already assembled. Mounting the bike on the trainer was easily done alone. A skewer type quick release hub is included if needed (I needed one). Amazon's low price and free shipping makes it a steal and is the best deal I could find anywhere. I absolutely love my Bell Trainer and highly recommend it.

Just what I wanted
This trainer is great. I have a basic trek mountain fat tire bike and it fits perfectly on the trainer. I was all ready to buy a real spinning cycle but decided to try this instead mostly due to space in my studio apt.I love spinning and I was having a hard time justifying two bikes in my small apt. I will address some of the points made by other posters:<br /><br />The noise factor: yes,noisy but not THAT bad. I use to have a treadmill and that was noisy as well. If I spin during odd hours, I use the IPOD. Otherwise I blare my stereo. You can get the music loud enough to drown the noise out. I never got complaints from any neighbors when I had the treadmill. Its only 30-45 minutes anyway. If you are doing more than that, its not necessary anyway (speaking as a certified trainer).I suppose you could purchase the road tire to eliminate noise, but I just don't think its worth it. Also, If I want to take a quick ride outside, I would have to change my tire. Changing a tire for this trainer is not necessary. They told me at a bike shop once, that I could not use my fat tire on one these trainers. Its all about whether you can take the noise or not, I guess.<br /><br />It comes fully assembled, really easy to slip your bike into. Easy to take bike off quickly as well, for a ride outside.<br /><br />Workout is just like being on spinning cycle at the gym except if you try to do the lifts off the seat, like they do in the classes. It may be my bike, but it wasn't fluid when I tried this. This does not bother me.<br /><br />If you put the bike on carpet, you do not need the front tire lifter/stablizer. The rear tire is not so high that you feel you are falling forward. If I had hardwood, I would get some kind of mat or get the front tire lifter just to keep the front tire stable.<br /><br />Lastly, I am hard on any cardio equipment, meaning my workouts are intense and fast. This trainer keeps the bike very stable.<br />Another item that might help is getting peddle straps to keep feet from slipping forward. This item is also not necessary, but helpful.<br />

Excellent product and service
First off, I'm a full-time dad (not an everyday biker)with a new born under six months.  Any kind of cardio exercise on my own time right now away from home is practically impossible. So I bought this based on two motives:  inexpensive and practical.  <br /><br />I believe the price speaks for itself.  Right out of the box, this trainer is practically ready to go.  Just had to tighten two bolts on the trainer to my bike's rear axle and that was it. <br /><br />The ride is actually very smooth and the noise factor for my budget is bearable.  The construction of the trainer feels sturdy and well built.  I would be surprised if I didn't get a hundred or more hours out of this.<br />  <br />Also want to say, very impressed with Amazon's delivery service.  Ordered my trainer yesterday with next day delivery service and within 24 hours it was at my doorstep just as promised.   <br /><br />

No regrets!!
This bike trainer is no cheap piece of equipment. It is well built and looks like it will last. It is very noisy on knobby tires. I changed my tires to some slicks and the noise was down drastically. Set up was very easy. Just unfold and you are done. This is my first bike trainer so I cannot really compare to other expensive trainers out there. No regrets on this purchase.

Great product
I really like this product.  I don't have a lot of room for large exercise equipment so this fits perfectly in my house.  I will be changing the back tire to reduce some of the noise but I am able to ride my bike and watch TV without waking my young child sleeping in the next room.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Exactly What I Was Hoping For!
Trainer is excellent.  First off, it's $80 so you can't expect the best piece of equipment on the market.  Second, for those reviewers that felt the quick release hub was required... it's not! The standard (non-quickrelease) axle on by bicycle fits just fine. In fact, I use this trainer daily with my road bike and have zero ZERO Z E R O  complaints. <br /><br />As far as coming fully assembled, I took it out of the box, sat it on the floor, positioned the bike and tightened the axle holders until it was tight enough to hold the bike safely.  Can't get much easier than that! <br /><br />Love it.  Recommend it whole-heartedly!

No need for anything fancier
I was a bicycle racer for over 10 years.  For indoor training, you do not need anything fancier than this model.  It is basic and effective.  I bought it on sale for $83.62, which is an absolute steal.  I am glad I bought it.

Mag Trainer
Shipped as promised, tracked package, arrived on time, good condition.<br /><br />Yea, its a little noisy but noise is not an issue for me since I use it on the patio. Slip on your headphones and think of how much money you saved buying it online instead of the local bike shop or large retailer.<br /><br />The item is sturdy and it functions. For all of us who need to log some miles without dodging traffic this is a good deal.<br /><br />Jim

Not Noisy!
I have been using by Bell Motivator for about a month now and while it does produce a bit of noise, the cause is the rear bike tire tread NOT the trainer.  My tire tread is fairly smooth and hence, little noise.  A mountain bike tread would produce a lot of noise.  If it really bothers you, buy a tread-less rear tire to reduce the noise level when your bike is used as a trainer.<br /><br />The wheel at the back of the trainer provides adjustable resistance level and I must say that a 20-minute workout with this trainer, makes me sweat as much as my normal 45 minute outdoor workout!  I'd recommend this trainer to anyone who wants to keep up their biking routine, during the cold, rainy and snowy days of fall and winter (at least here in the NorthEast!)

Great trainer for a great price !!
I have a "mountain bike" (from Wal-Mart) which I've had for about 11 or 12 years, but it's in GREAT shape.  I haven't ridden it a whole lot, but bought this trainer in hopes of doing so. <br /><br />Being someone who isn't a "regular" biker, I didn't want to fork out tons of money on those trainers whose claim is to be the best for the best.  After reading MANY reviews, I chose this one.  It came assembled, ready to hold my bike.  After attempting to put my bike (with 26" wheels) on it, I remembered the one negative that a lot of people recognized -- the instructions defintely need improving.  But, after a little bit of time and thinking, I had my bike mounted and ready to go.<br /><br />I also read reviews about it being noisy.  I had a semi-slick tire put on my bike, and the noise doesn't really bother me -- I'm in a room in our garage watching tv or listening to the stereo -- definitely not a big deal - it creates no more noisy than a "wind bike", actually probably less.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it for anyone wishing to get more mileage out of their bike or just wishing to get some exercise without buying an extra piece of bulky exercise equipment.  This trainer can be folded and put out of the way quite easily.<br />

Great Quality Product for the Money
The Bell motivator is a great buy for the money on Amazon.com as it is quick to set up with no assembly required. The noise others talk about directly relates to the type of tire they have on their bike. No surprise here, as my bike has a hybrid tire for mountain biking and road riding. The noise is very minimal. I would expect some noise from a direct contact that creates friction. DUH.Some other reviewers expect NO noise? And yes, you can adjust resistance on the tire by tightening the pressure on the tire.

Great trainer, love it
I just bought this trainer because I cannot stand to ride outside in the cold this time of year.  I was skeptical at first since it was so cheap but it got great reviews so I decided to try it.  I loved that it came fully assembled and it took no longer than 5 minutes to get my bike on it.<br /><br />As others have said, it is very noisy with a knobby mountaine bike tire.  Since I lived in an apartment I only used it twice because of the noise.  But that problem was solved by getting a slick road tire, the noise has been reduced to a slight buzzing sound, I probably won't even have to turn the TV up more than a notch or two more than usual.  <br /><br />It is a little heavy, but definitely movable.  I live in a small apartment so it is a little bit of a pain to take the bike on and off each day or move the trainer, but it's not so heavy that I can't move it if I need to.  And don't waste your money on anything to raise the front of the bike, the incline isn't that great and if need be a phone book would do the trick.  All in all I love it and you probably won't find anything better for the money.

Perfect bike substitute for the cold months
I bought this item in October just as fall was starting, and this is a great replacement for biking outside during the cold months.  It is inexpensive, easy to set up, and works perfect.  I have a mountain bike, so it is a bit noisy b/c of the treads, but i just put on some music or a book on tape and ride away.   There may be better indoor trainers, but at this price, this trainer is outstanding.  I would also recommend a front tire stand like CycleOps Stackable Climbing Block for Indoor Bicycle Trainers, so that the bike is level and stable.

These are good and cheap.
I recently bought this pack and tried them right away. These responded great on the course, even on rough I still could get good lift AND spin. On the greens they're pretty firm. Though from the tee these don't have the same feel as Titleists PRO V1 or Callaways HX's. Because of their price, I guess it's a psychological thing knowing no matter how you hit the ball, if it is lost you don't lose that much. It's conforting to know that. I guess this helps hit the ball more confidently. I would definitely recommend these.

Golf balls
I am not a good golfer, but these balls are very reasonably priced and seem to go the same distance as other balls. They are easy to spot on the fairway as my ball due to the red writing on them.

Best Kept Secret in Golf
I found an Intech Beta Ti golf ball during a round I was playing a couple of years ago and decided to try it off the next tee.  It was my longest drive of the day and I've been playing this ball ever since. I have a 14 handicap but don't really notice any appreciable difference in the performance of this ball vs. the much more expensive "premium" balls like Titleist, Nike or Callaway.  Try 'em, you'll like 'em. <br /><br />Update February 2009:  I'm still using this ball and continue to believe it's the best bargain in golf.  Yes, they are softer and less durable than other balls but at the price they can't be beat.  I've used other balls including Titleist, Callaway and Nike and can't really see much difference in performance.  I'm a 15-handicap golfer but I've let my low handicap buddies try this ball and they are amazed by its distance, accuracy and trajectory.  Like I said 2 years ago, "Try 'em, you'll like 'em."
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Great for older golfers
Great for golfers over the hill! I accually increased my distance by using a softer ball. That gives me the confidence to ease up my swing and improve my game. I highly recommend this ball for those who find they cannot hit the ball as far as they did earlier in their life.

Why Golf Balls are like NASCAR
A friend gave me a sleeve of these balls a week ago and I liked them so much I just placed an order for them on Amazon. Some facts about golf balls that I learned from a friend of over 20 years who has worked for the largest golf ball manufacturer and just retired from that company last year. Years ago I used to buy X out balls to save money, and like you I thought they were blems thus the cheaper price. What my friend told me was that x outs were absolutely perfect balls, except that for that days run all golf balls would be marked as x outs. Why? Because the company knew there were golfers that would play $[...] a dozen, and those that would pay $[...] a dozen, they wanted both customers. Any ball that was not perfect was always destroyed, not sold as an x out. And who wouldn't want a premier ball at a lower price, but there were the guys who wanted the same ball but wanted the prestige of having the most expensive without the x. Like he said you will see pallets of x outs at a pro shops, if they really made that many mistakes they would be out of business. <br />While he would never tell me the true cost to make a ball he did tell me that the cost between the cheapest 2 piece vs their premier 3 or 4 piece ball was just a few pennies. The extra cost was due to each extra step in a mold to add the extra layer. Also ball manufacturers use the same materials, there is no proprietary materials, but that different formula mixes gave each ball different characteristics. He said that golf balls were like NASCAR because NASCAR set rules so that all cars are the same, very little variance, and the the USGA does the same for golf balls. Basically other than the normal rules like diameter and weight no ball that is hit by a mechanical machine with a 9 degree titanium driver at 120 mph swig speed can travel with roll more than 320 yards. There is even consideration being given to lower that distance because most courses can't be made longer and par 4 and 5 holes are playing one stroke lower with new equipment. <br />Bottom line is if you think a $[...] dollar ball is a better ball that a $[...] ball, well the ball manufacturers love you. All that is built into that $5 ball could be in a $1 ball, and in some brands is, but why if they can get that extra $[...] dollars. What justifies that extra $[...] dollars is the fact that you see that balls name on a pro's cap on the Sunday final. Status has its price. As for these Intech Beta Ti and also their Limbo balls they don't meet USGA standards, and could be the reason for the extra distance most reviewers here seem to get. I get about 15 yards more than my other approved balls with the Intechs. Keep in mind if you play in a club or USGA event with a non conforming ball like the intechs you will be disqualified. And most informal scrambles or golf outing that that have a prize like car for a hole in one, the insurance company that covers the cost of the car usually in the fine print requires your club and ball must be USGA approved to get the prize for your hole in one. Bottom line don't pay attention to brands or price, play the ball that works best for you, not a pro on the tournament.

These Balls Rock My Face!
I've been a regular golfer for 4 years this season, and I've played these balls for a little more than half that time.  First and foremost: these balls play wonderfully.  There's no problem you could encounter with this ball that you won't have with any other ball out there.  In response to a couple recurring themes in these reviews, here's my two cents:<br /><br />1. The laws of aerodynamics don't lie: golf balls fly truer when the face of the ball has been roughed up, which is why I'm not so concerned about the soft-ish cover on this ball.  Unless some fairly large chunks have been torn off the ball, I don't sweat it.<br />2. Any benefit the more expensive balls can provide are lost on most of us anyway--we're not pros.  Heck, most of us can't even break par!  So what's the sense in spending more on a ball?  Use the money you save on these balls and get on the range to learn how to hit them. <br /><br />Ever since I started playing with these balls I've gotten such a kick out of poking around in the woods and the rough, looking for the rockin'-yet-cheap ball I hit into it, and coming out with the Callaway and Titleist and Nike balls everyone else PAYED for me to find.  And THOSE are the ones I play when I need to carry hazards--better to risk losing the free ball, right?<br />

Why buy more expensive
I have played with a number of different balls, and these beta Ti balls go as far as any others.  Subjectively, it seems that more of my balls stay on the fairway when I hit these off the tee, although that may only be my perception.  Certainly I can not notice any difference in my game when I use these, although I am not a scratch golfer by far.  The other advantage is that at this price, it does not hurt me twice when I lose a ball, like it does when I lose a more expensive ball.

As good as the Best,better than the Rest!
I switched from Titleist to these Intech Beta Ti balls a few months ago. I have a 18 handicap and am a senior golfer. I play around 75 rounds a year. My group of players range from 15 to 20 handicapers. They play everything from Titleist, Taylor, Top Flight etc. I find I can drive these Intech's just as far and you can not beat the value. Try a box you won't be unhappy you did.<br />Another proud 912er in Texas..

When bogey golf is good...then these are great golf balls!
I bought these golf balls on a whim, knowing that if anything, they could be lost and I wouldn't feel too bad losing them. This part is still true. <br />However, I must admit, I actually like the feel of these golf balls. They are certainly softer than many others I have hit, but they seem to respond very well off the tee. In fact, I can hit these further and more straight than many more popular brands.<br />The closest match to a name brand ball would probably be the Nike Ignite, which I also find outstanding.<br />I lose balls all the time...tall rough, water, water, more water and the desert. So if I lose 3 balls playing 18 holes, than I'm down what, $2? Big deal.<br />I'll buy them again when I lose them all.

Great Price for a ball that does the job
I have been using the Intech Beta Ti EXD golfballs since May, 2008.<br />With a 22 handicap, I put plenty of balls into hazards such as water and woods.  With a price of less than $.50 per ball, I do not feel any anxiety over losing a ball.<br /><br />I am getting excellent distance that competes with higher priced balls designed for distance.<br /><br />I am getting good feel out of short distance and approach shots.<br /><br />For the money, these are the best buy I have found.

Buy these with confidence!
I have been using Nike golf balls for 2 years now and decided to try these because of the price... WOW! These perform SO much better than golf balls that are three times more expensive. Great trajectory, great feel both on the tee and on the green, and much better distance than Nike. I got through 18 holes with the same ball which I don't do often, so I'm tempted to say they're "forgiving" of off-center hits, but I might need a few more rounds to back that up. I CAN say with confidence that you will not regret buying these! I'm hooked!

How can you beat the price?
I've never really be able to tell the difference between golf balls, its probably because I'm not good enough yet. But for the price these ones are great, and I don't mind if I lose one or two . . . or three . . . or four . . . you get the point.

Big balls, Small price...
Hi. i am an amateur golfer with a 18 handicap.  i have been using these BetaTi balls because I cannot worry about wasting $1.00 Plus golf balls.  To my surprise, the more I play with them, the more I get used to the way they react to my way of playing.  I have hit these babies 300 plus yards.  I hit a green in one on a 350 par four in Costa Caribe Golf in Ponce, PR.  It doesnt happen often, but these babies fly and feel soft off the tee.  I tried the famous titleist pro V1 and have not hit them that far.  Try them, since they are so economical, you will hit the ball  with more confidence without the worry of losing a couple of them in the bushes.

Lost golf ball
I've been playing golf with this ball for almost two years and have found it to be just as easy to lose as balls costing twice as much.  Realistically, for the average golfer, a golf ball is a golf ball. They're all white, round, and have dimples. Most of us get spin on a shot by accident.  I'm not that great a golfer where I could notice the difference between golf balls and they're all hard to find in the rough.  At the rate I lose golf balls, the price of the Intech makes them the preferred ball. 3 Dozen for about [...] really suits my golfing budget.

Great golfball
I have used this ball for 6 months. Players laugh at me as they are paying off their bets. Most friends play Pro V 1 or 1+. I can drive the ball with the best, stops on the green and putts well. I am a player, 11 handicap and posted 78 rounds this year at a private club.

No Complaints
I am happy with my purchase of these balls.  They have a nice feel when hit and seem to roll true on the greens.  Their appearance seems to be free from defects and is appealing to the eye. <br /><br />I've played entire rounds with the same ball and they have held up just fine. (and yes, a lot of the time I'll lose a ball or two during a round)<br /><br />I'm only a little picky when it comes to golf balls, but these satisfy all my requirements.  I ordered 2 boxes (72 balls) for 32.98 and selected free shipping so they ended up costing less than $6 a dozen. I consider that a bargain.

Breakin 80 !
I've been playing over 25 years, usually trying to break 90 with my top-flites. Since I bought these balls I've shot under 80 three times!!!<br /><br />Seriously, the distance is amazing. I routinely hit 2-3 drives longer than 260 each round and have even hit a 7 IRON over 200 yds.<br /><br />You will love these balls, really.

Great balls!  Ultra unscientific ball comparison below...
Bought these balls a couple of weeks ago and was very pleased with their performance on the course.  I also did a very unscientific test in the garage.  I dropped the ball multiple times from an identical height next to a Top Flite, Titleist HPS, a Noodle, a Titleist Pro V1x and one or two others.  I compared the sound and the bounce height.<br /><br />Not surprisingly the Top Flite had a relatively bright, sharp, high sound and a consistently smaller bounce.  Of the group, the ball that the Intech was most similar to was the Titleist Pro V1x.  The height was identical and the sound was indistinguishable with my back turned.  As I said, hardly scientific but from what I've noticed the sound seems to be a decent indicator of how the ball feels when you hit it.  And while the bounce test doesn't take dimpling into effect, I imagine is at least a partially determining factor as to the distance the ball will go.<br /><br />So there you have it.  Intech Beta Ti EXD = Titleist Pro V1x... according to my garage floor anyway.<br /><br />

Great Golf Ball
I've been through two 36 count boxes (hey, I'm just a beginner) and can say that I'm extremely pleased with how these play.  I'm too broke to afford fancy Nike one balls and Calloway clubs, so I'm more than happy to cut my teeth on my Intech/Titech balls and clubs.

Great Golf Balls for a Low Price
Don't waste your money on over-priced golf balls. These Intech balls are the best bang for your buck. Put your money toward green fees and golf lessons.

Great for beginners
I am new to golf and was just looking for some cheap balls because I knew I would lose a bunch, these worked great, I had a hard time getting the golf ball to lift up and spin, but once I got these I seemed to be able to hit them great. I would recommend these to all beginners.

Used the golf balls all the time
I have used these golf balls for about three years and I really like them, will keep using them as long as they make them.

I'll be back
Great product, great price.  This low cost ball performs equal or better than its higher priced brand counterparts.  Long and straight on drives and responsive on the more delicate short shots.

Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend.  Clubs arrived promptly.  He's taken them out a few times and raves about them.  He is a beginner golfer so this was a great set for the price.

hmm
Just tried these clubs out today. The 5w and the 3/4 are by far my favorite in the set. Great clubs, and the bag is quite nice too. The bag comes with a few pockets on each side, an open side pocket(great for tee's) and a pocket for golf balls right at the side that works great. The stand the bag comes with works pretty well also. The Putter i found was pretty accurate also, with the white marking to show the sweet spot on the putter. The Grips on the clubs were a lil rough, but it was the first time using, i think they will get a little softer as i play. Overall great set of clubs.

Just what I needed

Love em so far!!
I ordered these clubs on Saturday and got them on Tuesday. For the price I wasn't expecting much in the way of style but when I got the club set boy was I impressed. The bag is super nice as well as the clubs. I took the clubs to the range yesterday and they feel great. <br />It's not a complete set of clubs for a seasoned Golfer but as a beginner I have everything I need.<br />I'm looking forward to playing a round of golf this weekend.<br /><br />Played a round of nine holes and I couldn't be happier with these clubs. I highly recommend these clubs to men that are picking up the game of Golf for the first time in your life. It's not a complete set of 14 clubs but as a beginner you don't need all 14 clubs. If you talk to any experienced Golfer they will tell you, you only need a limited set of clubs to start playing.

Bought for Christmas for my 14 year old son, who is almost 6 foot tall, so he needed an adult size set of clubs. He loves them!!! They are a great starter set.

Phenomenal Value
This set was a delight to use (have hit the driving range several times and 18 holes once since buying them).  The clubs are well crafted and well balanced, grips comfortable and faces well marked.  The bag itself is probably worth $100!  Tons of pockets for storage and the stand mechanism works sturdily.  I have not encountered the problem with club heads flying off -- will update the review if this occurs.  Very stylish, practical and completely affordable.  A bargain.
