Great for 3 weeks and then........
We purchased this unit for travel purposes.  For the first 3 weeks it ran great.  We recommended it to others and they also purchased it.  Then it stopped working.  Asus customer service has not been very helpful.  They want us to pay for return shipping and wait for 5 to 7 business days for their tech to look at it.  What good is a warranty?

Stopped working after a few months; no help from asus
This netbook is light, attractive, and has a usable keyboard. Initially, the battery life was great.<br /><br />After a few months of gentle use, the hinges attaching the screen loosened up and tore apart. I contacted asus for an RMA, but didn't send the netbook in immediately, as I still used it sometimes with an external monitor.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I sent it back and that's when the real nightmare began. Asus returned the netbook with repaired hinges and screen, but a completely broken keyboard. For over a week, I've been trying to get a replacement keyboard or an expedited repair, but asus doesn't care that the current problem is a direct result of their mishandling. Each time I call, the supervisor promises to "escalate," and then never calls back or does anything. Tonight, the supervisor I spoke with said it would take 2 to 3 business days to figure out whether they good reduce the normal 7 business day repair time!<br /><br />If you want a reliable netbook, don't risk this one. When it breaks, asus "customer support" will torture you into giving up.

A Quick Return
I bought this drive yesterday and I am returning it today.  The reasons?  There are two main ones.  Like the first reviewer, I find it annoying that Western Digital bundles the drive with their automatic software utility.  The first thing I did was reformat this drive using the disk utility on my macbook.  The drive reformatted, but the bundled software remained on my desktop.  I still had to eject both to unplug the drive.  When I plugged it into my PC, the automatic software came up there too and informed me that there was no longer a partition able to accept their program and that I should make sure that the drive was formatted correctly.  I formatted it FAT32 so that I could use it between my Mac and my PC.  Every time I plug it into my PC, the new hardware wizard pops up and tells me that the drive was installed incorrectly and may not work properly.  So far it does work properly, but I have no intention of going through this every time I want to access this drive on my PC.  I know that I could probably reformat the drive another way, or use my Mac to erase the contents more thouroughly, but that leads me to my second complaint:  the USB connector is awful.  WD seems to have gone to the newer micro-USB connector.  In addition to this making all my other USB cables obsolete, the connector will not stay in the drive.  Any slight movement, and you lose connection with your computer (Which means going though the whole automatic software and hardware wizard nonsense again).  Not very portable in my opinion.  <br /><br />I have used and liked WD drives in the past and was very excited to see a "portable" 1TB drive that did not require an external power source, but this drive will be going right back.  I will spend the extra money for the Seagate 1TB freeagent go drive.  I hope that one works right.

proprietary usb cable + software partition which cannot be removed
This unit came with a software partition which cannot be removed. I paid for a hard drive, not software.  The partition acts as a virtual CD and tries to install itself every time you plug it into a computer. You cannot remove this partition either. A total waste of space on the hard drive and waste of time every time you have to tell it to not install. Almost as bad as that, the USB cable is a proprietary one. If you have another USB cable that you want to use (as the one that comes with it is very short) forget about it. This device is an evolutionary step backwards in technology. It's hard to imagine how something as simple as an external USB hard drive could be screwed up, but Western Digital somehow managed to do it.

Don't Buy - Crippled with Unremovable Bloatware
<br />Don't make the mistake I did yesterday - I bought this. Very attractive drive, tiny...it does use a new USB connector, which is a pain, but it appears to be an open standard, so in a year or two I suspect I'll be happier about that.<br /><br />What is absolutely unacceptable is that every time you plug the drive in, it mounts TWO DRIVES--the one you plugged in, and another CD partition full of WD's backup software that they wish you'd use.<br /><br />You can't stop it from happening. If you eject it, it remounts. You can't erase it--it's in the firmware of the drive.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS, if you don't want to be marketed at continuously by your own hardware. At this time WDC has no system for stopping the automounting, and there's no ETA for a tool to stop this from happening. Of course, the best tool would have been to just make a good hard drive (which this was) and let people use it as they see fit.<br /><br />There are many other fine hard drives on the market. Avoid this one.

WARNING has unremovable software designed by cretins
Avoid this like the plague. WD have decided that just selling disk drives was too boring so they started adding 'intelligent' utilities. Problem is that this is what I buy a Mac or a PC for, not what I buy a disk drive for. If I am going to use a backup utility I am going to use one that does not lock me into one disk drive vendor. The WD bundled software is half baked and does not have a removal tool. Apparently one is 'in the works'.<br /><br />This is totally unacceptable, giving me the task of erasing the garbageware is bad enough. Not even comprehending that most people do not want it is pure arrogance. Somewhere in WD there is an over-promoted manager who told his boss how selling an intelligent drive will increase margins. Only they forgot the one small detail that writing software is hard, really hard. And writing O/S level code is hardest of all because you have to take into account so many details.<br /><br />I am very particular about security, I do not run code from random sources, I have no idea where the WD code comes from or how well it will work in practice. I wait for other people to find the bugs - particularly when the functionality is not something I want or need.<br /><br />I used a U3 drive from Sandisk in the day. The advantages were unimpressive and the drive could not be read on Vista. So the drive was rendered utterly useless for me as I run Vista on many of my machines. Never again. The WD software comes with a manual that does not even read under Mac Preview.<br /><br />I have had two passports before this one, but before I buy another they are going to have to put a sticker on the box saying 'no software loaded'.

Three strikes...
This is my THIRD straight WD Passport LEMON.<br /><br />Within the last 6 months or so, I bought first one WD 500 GB drive, which failed, and then another, which failed. Both of them had connection problems, which led to data corruption. And both of them failed completely within weeks. I didn't buy them from Amazon, but from a local big box. The first time, I replaced the bad one with the same model, figuring it was a fluke. The second time, I went back, got my money returned, and in the tradition of Charlie Brown and the football, bought a third WD drive, this time the 750 GB "portable."<br /><br />"Portable" in quotes, because as many others have noted, breathing in the vicinity of the USB connection makes the thing dismount, causing all kinds of grief for the apps that are trying to use it.<br /><br />After one day of repeated disconnections, I called WD tech support. The subcontinental gentleman on the other end said he hadn't heard of this problem, which is hard to believe judging from the reviews here. But he offered to mail me a new cable -- which arrived quickly because both it and I were in L.A.  I plugged in the new cable -- it felt solider, but not THAT much solider. And sure enough, all I had to do was pick up the drive, or even nudge it, and once again it was gone.<br /><br />Today I called WD again, told the rep that the new cable was also not working... He put me on hold for a while, then came back and said "Good news, sir! We have a solution! Since your drive is less than 30 days old, you can return it to the store where you bought it, and exchange it for a new one!"<br /><br />Some solution. I didn't have to call tech support to figure that out. But I told him I would... except that the drive I exchange it for won't be a Western Digital. Terrible engineering, plus that infuriating phantom software (which, even if you can dismount it, still takes up a ton of room on the disk). Three disks, three strikes... Outta heah!

Western Digital should recall this product
I have purchased most of the previous versions of passports. And this latest product (750G) is really bad.<br /><br />There are two things that are going wrong:<br /><br />1) New cable. The new cable constantly loses the connection with the hard drive. They should have kept the regular cable, unsure why they had to change it.<br /><br />2) Proprietary software in the bios. You can not delete it. It is in the bios. It never goes away.<br /><br />After using it for one month, the HD broke down. Now I need to return it.<br /><br />Don't buy this product. <br />

Total Fail -- I used to love WD.
Passport drives were one of the best products on the market, until this disaster.   What happened?  Well, every once in a while a company decides to "be like Microsoft" (or Sony) and attempt to ram proprietary software down your throat.  The result (as is evident in the bottom lines of both Sony and Microsoft) is invariably user rebellion.  Some sheep stick around, but those sheep will eventually start to wonder why their machines are running slowly and what all those ridiculous apps are for.<br /><br />This drive is probably ok.  Unfortunately, me (like 1000's of others) returned it instantly because it uses a proprietary software partition and it keeps trying to install proprietary software everywhere it goes.  Total fail.  Get two smaller drives if you must.  This 1TB disaster is a dark omen of bad things to come from WD.<br /><br />

Buy something else.
I purchased this product last month and I almost wish I hadn't. The idea is great, lots of storage on something almost as small as an ipod. I was very excited to get this thing plugged in and start filling it up. Well first the completely ridiculous "WD Smartware" program is just stupid and useless. The idea was great, auto backup. Well all it does is make a window pop up when you plug it in to ask you if you want to open the program and then it slows your computer down to a slow crawl. It also is not optional, you have to either reformat your drive, or go into the preferences and tell it to not open when you plug the drive in. That aside, even without the stupid program running, this drive slows down my computer to almost a standstill the entire time its plugged in, even if im not using it. Maybe it's my computer but i dont think so, my computer runs great with my 125GB WD external drive. so its either the fact that the 1TB drive is getting all its power from my computer or the thing is just made to slow everything down. It doesnt transfer files very quick either, i moved 70GB of music from my computer to it and it took over 4 hours, that is ridiculous. it only took 1 1/2 hours to be copied onto my 3 year old 125GB drive. I would say try to find a better alternative to this drive, you let us down western digital.

Software stored in Firmware and Proprietary USB Cable & Connector
I pre-ordered this drive months before it was available because I thought it would be just like the traditional WD My Passport drives that I have recommended to so many people. I use these drives on my Mac systems and I now no longer recommend the WD My Passport series to anyone. Instead, I strongly recommend against them. First, I generally do not like the software that is included with external hard drives. Whenever I buy a new drive I immediately format it to get rid of any of the extra software. When I first plugged this drive in, I discovered an additional volume was loaded that contains the software. I thought maybe this was like some other drives I had used that want you to format the rest of the drive to match your system or something like that. I tried formatting and whatever method I could think of to get rid of that extra volume. A quick search revealed that this volume is built into the firmware and is always there whether you like it or not. I DO NOT like being forced to have an extra volume around. This software problem was bad but on top of that, WD had to use a tiny little USB connector that I have never seen before which is totally incompatible with all of my mini USB cables. To make it even worse, this connector is so loose and flimsy that if I move the cable the slightest bit, it falls out. This is not acceptable for a portable hard drive. Western Digital is going the wrong way! Avoid their external portable drives like the plague!! Please bring back the older style drives that used normal mini USB cables and did not have any software that you cannot get rid of!!

Wait
1) I don't like any space nor any effort that I have to give to disable or remove software. Stupid move, but not unique to Western Digital. I have a Luxio USB 128GB memory key that does the same. What goes through the minds of these companies I do not know. I don't care if I only lose a small part of the capacity, or I can go to a website and get a way to shut it off. The latter takes my time, doesn't that have any value?<br /><br />2) The cable is a hassle to carry around with the use I put to this device. Someone mentioned LaCie, which has a smaller capacity drive but a built in cable. Western D could have made this drive slightly more rectangular and added a short cable to unfold from the unit. Many may find such a solution too short, but not me.

The stupid cable ruins it
This is the most unreliable external HD i have ever had the misfortune to purchase. The cable is easily dislodged by breathing on it, looking at it funny, or just about anything. <br /><br />Half the time I plug it in, it doesn't mount (show up on my computer). So, it's useless as a backup drive.<br /><br />Even if the cable does work, the hard drive comes with bloatware that is required to see the drive. <br /><br />Overall a F'ing useless piece of crap.

Avoid buy SEAGATE 1TB portable.
Should have listen to previous reviewer. Bought it at Fry, return within 2 hours. I try my best and can't delete the unwanted software. Anyway what a shame, WD. Whoever made the decision to integrate this software, should be relegated to be a Technician.

Disappointed in Western Digital
I have always been a fan of Western Digital products.  Their quality and dependability have been outstanding! The passport essential se 1-tb is NOT a product I would recommend to anyone.  WD usually works out the issues with their products, but they have missed the mark with this one.  The drive was unrecognizable by my computer even after I downloaded the driver.  The passport is sleek and impressive to look at, but the proof is in the pudding.  Even after my computer recognized it, the connection with the drive would drop out.  Unfortunately this was a waste of my time to even mess with.  Western needs to do more work on the compatibility of this drive to ensure their high reputation maintained.  I am returning this product for a full refund.

Micro USB connector breaks connections on any slight movement
Good: Look, size and design is simple superb and handy.<br />Bad: Micro USB connector breaks connections on any slight movement<br />Overall Review: Very impressed with the design and size initially but unfortunately, the performance is retarded. The connector constantly breaks connection which leads to errors for slight movement of drive or our laptop, I am very very disappointed in this.

Cliche-ridden, exposition heavy dud
I admit it, I am out-of-step with current, popular taste, because I seem to be the one man on earth who thinks that the international bestseller  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a lousy book. I'm not even sure why I finished reading it. Sonny Mehta, the book's U.S. publisher at Knopf, calls it "deeply ambitious, insightful and fiercely smart," and I am here to tell you it is none of those things.  <br /><br />The book is two-thirds exposition... we're talking hundreds and hundreds of pages of numbingly dull backstory that brackets the one third in the middle where something actually happens. Unfortunately, what happens isn't ambitious, insightful, fiercely smart or even mildly interesting. And it's all written with cliche-ridden prose that is so bad that it's distracting. (that may be the fault of the translator, Reg Keeland, and not the original, Swedish author, Stieg Larsson). Here are some examples:<br /><br />"I think you are grasping at straws going to Hedestad."<br /><br />and<br /><br />"Ricky, that story is dead as a doornail."<br /><br />and <br /><br />You didn't have to be a rocket scientist to see that these events were somehow related. There had to be a skeleton in one of their cupboards.<br /><br />These are just three examples out of hundreds. And there are also a lot of clumsy descriptions, like this one: <br /><br />She looked like an ageing vampire -- still strikingly beautiful but venomous as a snake.<br /><br />So is she a vampire or a snake?  Are vampires venomous? And there are even clunkier sentences, like this one:<br /><br />Harald Vanger had gone back to his cave by the time Blomkvist came out. When he turned the corner, he found someone quite else sitting on the porch of the cottage.<br /><br />Someone quite else?? Either Larsson was a very bad writer or the translator's grasp of English isn't so good. It certainly doesn't strike me as "fiercely smart."<br /><br />The title of the book is misleading, too, since it refers to the hero's sidekick and not the actual central character, who is a one-dimensionally valiant reporter for a financial magazine who is irresistible to women. If the women that he meets don't bed him immediately and fall madly in love with him, it's clear that they desperately want to.  Virtually all the men in the tale are sadists and all the women in the story have been sexually brutalized, willingly or unwillingly (it's mentioned in an aside that the reporter and his business partner/lover dabbled in S&M and bondage for fun years ago). Maybe that's why the original title of the book in Sweden was MEN WHO HATE WOMEN. I'm not kidding, that was the title.<br /><br />It all adds up to a book that's heavy on dull exposition, glorifies rape & torture while pretending to disapprove, and is written in unbearably flat, cliche-ridden prose. I can't find a single positive thing to say about the book except that the galley was well-bound and is no longer taking up space on my bookshelf.

I just don't get it.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)</a><br /><br />I really don't understand the critical orgasms over this book.  Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it.  Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: "Did one of our employees recommend this?"  Um, yeah.  And Amazon, too.  So of course I asked him why. <br /><br />"Oh," he replied, "we've been told to recommend it this week."  That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management.  Pfft.  I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth?  Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller?<br /><br />But I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family.  Of course it totally sucks.  I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known.  But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND.<br /><br />Here's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced.  NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight.  I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD.  I mean bad.  The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares.  The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them.  I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too.  "He went to the store.  He bought milk.  He was cold.  He went home." - BOR-RING!  I am not really exaggerating, either. <br /><br /><br />Actual content:<br />"He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches.  He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food.  he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst.  After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack."<br /><br />Again, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description.  It sets the tone of "lonely dude being lonely" but really: two sandwiches?  why two?  sausage and liverwurst - fascinating.<br /><br />That's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse.  I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read.  I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead.  Why have all the reviewers and Amazon steered me SO WRONG???<br /><br />I am not starting any kind of flame war here or trying to insult anyone's taste - so please don't get mad about my opinion.  But if you love this book, please - tell me WHY.  What am I missing?<br /><br /><br /><br />

??? I don't get it.
I thought this was a terrible book. Bad enough to take the time to give it a review.<br /><br />Most books I can understand the hysteria around them, even if I don't personally like it. This book is an exception. Graphic violent sexually abuse, descriptions of pointless meals, and heap loads of history on a boring family, helpless women that don't seem to do anything about their problems, and multiple side stories and characters that don't contribute in any way. Even if it was written beautifully, how could this be interesting?!<br /><br />I picked this up since it was all over the best seller lists and what a lousy excuse for a book.<br /><br />NOTHING seemed to happen, except for a few pages near the end, which didn't make any sense at that point since I was skim reading the book after about pg 150. The characters are not interesting at all, very stereotypical. Genius hacker, skinny, outcast girl, and the irresistible journalist who seems more worried about his sex life than solving any 'mystery.'<br /><br />So to summarize the book-<br />Journalist man does something trivial, genius chick is explained as not being a genius, but challenged, random sexual encounter, coffee and sandwiches(I wish I could do a search for this one for an actual count), description of clothes and financial/family history documents, repeat this pattern every 30 pages for the next 600!!!! pages.<br /><br />I could cut the book some slack and blame it on the translation, but if the guy translated coffee and sandwich scenes that many times, they must have been in the original.<br /><br />The editors need to take a chainsaw to this book, it could have been 400 pages shorter and the same amount of actual stuff that happened would not have been affected.<br /><br />The only reason I finished it is because I have no other books to read and to give credibility to this review. Please read something that isn't a waste of your time.

Boring,convoluted and senseless
I cannot for the life of me understand the numerous accolades this book has received. I thought that I must be the only person who found this a tedious, boring and inane read. My dental assistant ( an avid reader) found it equally ridiculous. This could have been reduced to half the amount of pages and I still would have found the story mundane.This ranks up there with one of the worst books I have ever read. Save your money.

Stomach turning misogyny & veiled pedophilia
Aside from a missing person investigation that kept my interest for a short while, this book alternates with being too sick and then too boring & is ultimately not worth the time. THREE characters are sadists who target women (overkill, maybe??). The main character is a trite portrayal of what old deluded men probably fantasize about being. The relationship he has with his editor for instance is wholly unrealistic- two people who have sex regularly and work together are just not gonna BOTH be cool and pleasant about the other sleeping around. I found the whole book from start to finish to be a misogynistic indulgence (that the author thought he could disguise with weak attempts at outrage for the situations he created & elaborated on to a sickening, repetitive and quite 'telling' degree). You can change the name of the book from "Men who Hate Women" in the US reprint, but you're not fooling anyone (I didn't find that out until after I wrote the first review). The character fighting against all this sadism is a 4'11'' anorexic with aspergers syndrome, which begs the question: what is this guy trying to say by making this character so small & defenseless? Part of the first chapter of the next book in the series was included at the end, which AGAIN was completely misogynistic and sadistic toward females- the only difference was that this time the victim was 13!?!! Hmmm... if he can sell a book about violence against small skinny women (& it turns out to be a best seller), maybe he can sell the second one about violence toward children. It's as if the author is 'grooming' large masses of readers into his pedophilic musings. The irony was that this section is supposed to be meant to want to make us run out & buy the next book in the series??? What? Who are these people who want to read about what pedophiles do to kids???? I've wasted enough time with this guy's disgusting fantasies. Apart from the pedophilic and sadistic scenes that make this book 'part of the problem,' the character and story development is sorely lacking & doesn't even begin to compare to Silence of the Lambs (which was referenced on the cover). It veers off into other directions that are just boring & all the references to Nazi's makes me wonder if this author was at all aware of his own hypocrisy; feining outrage at mysogyny in a story that indulges it. That kind of righteous indignation & self-delusion is pretty consistent with pedophilia & I think the popularity of this series is an example of how a seeminly benign veiled pedophile can get into one's head & make you accept things you would never have thought possible. There's no reason to read these books & nothing to be gained, this is just sadism for the sake of sadism.

Sadistic violence as entertainment? No thanks.
I picked up this book in the airport after reading how popular it was in a magazine.  The story grabbed me enough to finish it (though would I have finished if I wasn't stuck on a plane for 5 hours?).  I also kept thinking that surely the book would improve as it was such a best-seller.  But I'm left feeling very disturbed that a book with such graphically described sadistic violence against women would be so popular.  Why would you want to read stuff like that as entertainment?  The fact that this book is a internationally popular book makes me sad indeed.  The book puts in 4-5 statistics on violent crime against women at the beginning of some of the chapters.  But is comes off as a way of trying to justify itself.  Entertainment by fictional descriptions of horrific crimes against women- that is what this book is about.  Yuck.  I wont be reading anymore by this author.

Disturbing waste of time
Tedious, cliche-ridden and devoid of likable characters, I only finished this one because it's my book club's choice for this month. Contains graphic sex and violence, much of which has nothing to do with the mystery of the story. I saw the end coming from less than two-hundred pages in (though albeit, I thought the killer had a different motive), and I wish I had followed my gut instinct and stopped reading after two graphic rape scenes (warning: devices are used for these) that turned out to have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY!!!<br /><br />The main female character has trouble reacting to situations and interacting with people. She is often described as having a blank expression, and she refuses to talk to psychologists or any authorities. She's a ward of the state and deemed "mentally incompetent," yet she functions as this amazing researcher and computer hacker. It's only in the final pages that the main male character hypothesizes that she may have Asberger's Syndrome. Oh, yeah Stieg Larrssen? That might have been a handy piece of solid info earlier on to help us know the girl and be amazed by her talents at a much earlier point in the narrative.<br /><br />And that male character, ech. He's a total mimbo, sleeping with every available lady in the book, none of whom he has any kind of attachment to. The ladies find him irresistible, though I myself imagined him as a kind of heavier, older version of Stellen Skarsgard, who is like, probably Robert Redford in Sweden. Seriously. Even the chicks he doesn't bag look at him sideways like all he has to do is say the word. He is attached to one woman, an old friend who's married, and yet both of them expect their other lovers to just "understand" their bond. Maybe it's that way in Sweden, but it didn't hold much weight for me.<br /><br />In all the narrative goes off in quite a few directions that are never followed through on, with long portions that really don't tie well enough into the story. Overall, a big waste of my valuable reading time.

Much ado about nothing
The only people on earth who are allowed to sparkle are as follows...<br /><br />1) Drag Queens. A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug.<br /><br />2) David Bowie. Need I say more?<br /><br />Someone needs to explain the why's and wherefore's of this whole "sparkly vampire" business to me. I really don't understand it at all. Going out in daylight... OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles?<br /><br />Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroghly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick)<br /><br />As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren't any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn't any drama. This is a vampire movie with no caonflict among the main characters. Only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing's really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn't have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment "the new girl." <br /><br />Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella's sheriff dad and the "maulings" (read: vampire attacks) he's investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward's wangsting.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There's one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn't paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I'm sorry, but that's just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don't care if the poor guy is a bit character, I'd rather a small look at any if the bit characters' small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film.<br /><br />Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the "OMG bad vampires." I'll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I'm told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them.<br /><br />As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villain's aren't developed at all. They are clearly "OMG EVOL!!!1!!" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn't terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend Twilight to anyone. No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper.

Is this what love is supposed to be?
This is one of the most frightening displays of romance I've ever seen in my life.  This is NOT a love story.  Edward (male protagonist)is obsessive to the point of restraining order.  He watches her sleep, follows her everywhere and is only interested because this is the one persons mind he cannot read.  Bella (female protagonist) is about intriguing as a candy bar wrapper (an empty one at that).  <br /><br />Since I've read the books (occupational hazards of a librarian) I know this only gets worse.  In a world of quality young adult literature where relationships are often shown as fleeting and impermanent, this story should not have been published let alone made into a movie.<br /><br />After reading/viewing anything I have to ask: what's the point? In this instance I cannot come up with anything.  What is this book/movie trying to say about relationships?  Because this is scary, obsessed love, not fulfilling, lasting love.<br /><br />P.S. Why do recent authors think they have personal license to change vampire lore?

Atrocious in a thoroughly enjoyable way
I can't recall the last time I had this much FUN with a poorly-made movie. I honestly can't decide whether I want to give it 'one star' for how genuinely terrible it is, or 'five stars' for how enjoyable it was to be appalled by.<br /><br />It's a sort of tradition amongst my local friends and I to rent movies we fully expect to be bad and watch them together; often we're just bored and, by the time the ending credits roll, feeling that we just lost two hours of our lives that we shall never get back. This one, though, stands out as one of the greats. <br /><br />If you're new to the series, the premises is this: Bella Swan (yes, 'beautiful swan') moves from her arid Phoenix home to Forks, Washington, where she meets and falls in love with a dour and seemingly perpetually-nauseated boy named Edward Cullen. She soon discovers his secret - that he's a vampire! - by Googling "cold ones," a term she finds in a book of Native American mythology. One would expect that Googling this term would actually yield many pages pertaining to beer. Or maybe that's just me. Anyway, a very clingy and angst-ridden relationship ensues, and after playing baseball in a thunderstorm with Edward's family, Bella meets a nasty vampire named James, who immediately develops his own obsession with her.<br /><br />Unlike Edward, though, James wants to eat Bella. Really badly.<br /><br />Most of this takes place in the latter half of the movie. The first half is comprised mostly of Bella moping around her new town and exchanging silent stares with Edward.<br /><br />Ah, Edward.<br /><br />It gave me pleasure to discover exactly how much the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, despises Edward Cullun.<br /><br />"When I read it I was convinced Stephenie was convinced she was Bella and it was like it was a book that wasn't supposed to be published. It was like reading her sexual fantasy, especially when she said it was based on a dream and it was like, 'Oh I've had this dream about this really sexy guy,' and she just writes this book about it. Like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced, like, 'This woman is mad. She's completely mad and she's in love with her own fictional creation.' And sometimes you would feel uncomfortable reading this thing..." "...the more I read the script, the more I hated this guy."<br /><br />Edward Cullen has a completely inconsistent personality, and Pattinson solved this by playing him as, in his own words, "as a manic-depressive who hates himself."<br /><br />Now, I understand some preteen girls actually find Edward's various advances upon Bella to be romantic - like admitting to sneaking into her room to watch her sleep for months before he even made an attempt to be nice to her. I'm led to wonder how some fathers would feel if they knew their young daughters admired such qualities in future boyfriends. Personally I think Edward is downright creepy, but as Pattinson apparently meant to portray him this way, kudos to Mr. Pattinson!<br /><br />For Bella's part, she's an unabashed Mary Sue, with every male in town falling all over himself to befriend, date, or, in one scene, gang rape her. It's Edward, however, who wins her inexplicable devotion, mainly by following her around and saying things like, "We shouldn't be friends," or, "Stay away from me!" in a low menacing voice. <br /><br />By the end of the movie, after lots of heaving and sighing and rushed special-effects, we're meant to believe that the two are star-crossed lovers, though they seem more like an abusive relationship in the making. With the vampire James dispatched, Edward and Bella slaver over each other's necks at prom, and James' female companion Victoria slinks away in the backdrop, doubtlessly plotting mischief.<br /><br />There's also a sub-plot straight from the underwhelming "Underworld" series regarding a rivalry between werewolves and vampires, but it's barely touched on in this installment. <br /><br />I wonder, given his public slandering of the franchise, whether Mr. Pattinson will reprise his role as Edward in the next film. A part of me is looking forward to it.

The Few Strong Points Are Swallowed by the Overwhelming Campy Badness
I consider myself a Twilight fan. I love the books and since reading the first one have bought the other three the day they came out. I was extremely excited about the movie, and went to see it opening night. My first thought by the halfway point of the movie was: WHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS?!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Twilight: The Movie is a horrible, campy, tacky, CHEAP vampire story that swallows almost all of the power of the novels. The vampire special effects are even WORSE than "Queen of the Damned" (which is hard to achieve), and the "action" scenes were scripted, confusing, and in some cases pointless and lame.<br /><br />The acting was off and it was awful. Kristin Stewart was weak and ineffectual as Bella. She portrays none of Bella's strengths and instead presents her as, essentially, a weakling, a coward and a whiner. Rob Pattinson's Edward is kind of creepy, kind of tacky, and completely unromantic; in fact, he's kind of off-putting. None of the Cullens act like they're supposed to except Rosalie and Alice, so of course they only got about five lines each in the entire movie.<br /><br />The worst acting choice was whoever played Charlie -- he's a dead fish in the entire movie. He never displays ANY emotion. Now, in the books Charlie IS kind of closed-off, but he DOES get upset -- like when Bella says she's running away, for instance. In the movie, he's quiet and unmoved and seems to say nothing but "Oh, my daughter's running away. Don't go, Bella. Please stay, Bella. Wonder what's on TV?"<br /><br />However, first and foremost, the love story element was RUINED by the script. Bella and Edward are awkward as can be together, and at one point Edward makes the cryptic comment "It would be better for you if we weren't friends." Now, at this point in the movie, he's been nothing but a supreme jerk to Bella at every turn. If I were Bella, my response would have been: 'What?! We AREN'T friends! You're a creeper and you need to go before I call the cops! Stranger danger! [Makes sign of the cross]'<br /><br />By the time they're 'together' as a couple it feels so rushed and unnatural that you have to gag at some of Bella's more romantic thoughts, which make perfect sense in the book. One of the worst mistakes they made was combining about five different important scenes and shortening them into one confusing scene: the meadow scene, combined with the first running scene, combined with the skipping class scene, combined with three other minor scenes. It was rushed, confusing, creepy, unromantic, weird, badly acted, badly shot, and badly directed.<br /><br />The dynamic of Bella and Edward was ruined -- Edward is supposed to be so supremely larger than life to Bella; for instance, in the book when he runs (he's supposed to look like a blur, which the movie of course killed off right away) with Bella the first time she's violently ill and can't stand for a moment. In the movie she just hops off his back as if to say 'Alright, I do this all the time.'<br /><br />In the book, James, the villain, is actually rather terrifying. In the movie...okay, the actor is admittedly very attractive. But -- have you ever seen the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (NOT the show, because the show was amazing; the movie was awful)? You know, where Rutger Hauer played the most CAMPY, RIDICULOUS vampire EVER? Well, James almost TOPS his performance in "Buffy" -- again, VERY hard to achieve.<br /><br />Another point of unintended comedy? Bella and Edward spend half the friggin' movie in a TREE. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. He calls her "spider monkey," for the love of GOD. It's SILLY! And then when the Cullens jump at the 'bad vampires'? It looks like they're about to perform the song and dance "fight" in the first scene of "West Side Story!" How utterly absurd!<br /><br />The casting was awful, the acting was awful, the script was awful, the special effects were AWFUL. Possibly the only good points about this movie was the first five minutes, which actually did a very good job for some strange reason, and the last five minutes, which also did a very good job, for some strange reason. Every other minute of the movie was excruciating in its mediocrity.<br /><br />I pray to God every day that people don't watch this D-Grade piece of CRAP movie and go away thinking to themselves, "Well, now I KNOW I'll never read 'Twilight' after watching THAT crap."

Twilight of the Vampire Romance
I have to believe Twilight was the most talked-about film of 2008 in the science-fiction/fantasy community. When it hit DVD, I was anxious to see it. An hour into the film, however, I was fighting the urge to turn it off and toss the disc into the trash. How is it that this unoriginal, glacially-paced, staggeringly emotionless film has such a large fan following? I can only presume that because I'm not a young girl keeping a weepy self-indulgent diary, and therefore fall outside of the target demographic, I just don't "get it."<br /><br />My wife has read all the books five times, and was even more anxious than I to see the film, but she literally walked out of the room halfway through, never to see the end, complaining that the film version had "ruined" every single aspect of the books (though these ideas are so threadbare, I personally don't even see how the books could have been better). Naturally, a movie has to change things  --  it's a different medium from literature - but my wife assures me that the changes were arbitrary and ruinous. She also assured me that the main male character, who we both thought was terrible, was not coming across as the super-mega-hunk everyone says he is. So it's not just because I'm a guy that I thought he was flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />It's a plot point that there's little sunlight in this film, but after an hour of watching this overly blue-toned movie, you just start feeling ill. There are no flesh tones; everyone is blue and sickly-looking. It starts to wear on you. The main character looks like they magic-marker'd his eyebrows in.<br /><br />As to the plot... what plot? Listen, folks... vampire romances have been done to absolute death by now. Everything in this film, we have seen before, either through Near Dark, Forever Knight, Anne Rice novels, or even Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The brooding James-Deanish vampire love interest has passed deeply into cliché (Angel did it better, but I even thought it was getting old ten years ago). About the only thing "new" here is the idea that vampires actually look "beautiful" in their true appearance, yet on my big flat screen, what the main female character was oohing & ahhing about looked more like slimy snakeskin than diamonds, so even at THAT level, I was out of sync.<br /><br />Anyone buying or renting this film has SOME idea of what it's about, even if just from the movie poster. And yet it takes the film a full hour to get us there. We've seen this and seen it... you can hurry along to the big "reveal" and get the actual PLOT moving, please. But even when it starts to move... well... we've seen that too!<br /><br />I really do not understand what magic this film holds for people, but if you haven't seen this yet, you too are probably not among its target audience. So save yourself and give Twilight a pass. It's a tired old derivative idea presented in a stunningly boring package, with a whole cast of young, unlikeable, blue-skinned people.<br />

Sorely disappointed...
While I am not among the core demographic that this movie was targeted for, I am an enormous fan of the Twilight books. So I was more than thrilled to learn that a movie was being adapted out of them. Always one of the mind that "book is always better than the movie," I didn't have huge expectations given the budget and director. Even my lowered expectations were not prepared for the monstrocity that appeared on the screen. For 120 minutes, I watched a wooden cast run through the motions of the script. Kristen Stewart could not have been worse. Bella is a warm and charmingly clumsy young woman. Although in the books, she appears aloof at times, she loves fiercely and with all her heart. Ms. Stewart never even came close to any of those emotions except the aloofness. Her stilted portrayal of Bella was heart-breaking to watch. Even when she was being tortured by James, she barely managed a facial expression.<br /><br />Robert Patterson was a "passable" Edward. He maintains Edward's stoic and agonized behavior after meeting Bella. However, Edward of the novels is a larger-than-life presence with a restrained passion that is always teetering on the brink. Patterson falls short in his portrayal, leaving the viewer with a feeling that Edward is really nothing but a jerk. And the chemistry between Patterson and Stewart is...wait, there was none. I got the impression that they didn't even LIKE each other a majority of the time.<br /><br />As for the other actors, they were fairly true to the novel. Carlisle and Esme gave decent performances as loving and doting "parents." Rosalie's snide and pretentious behavior was right on the mark; Alice's sweetness, Jasper's restraint, even Emmett's teddy bear/jackal persona were all very believable. BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN THE MOVIE FOR TEN MINUTES TOTAL!!!<br /><br />Another disappointment was the holes that the movie left in the story. One of the key pieces in the first novel was the desire the high school boys felt for Bella. In hindsight I understand why the director chose to leave most of it out. NO ONE would believe that these boys would hone in on Ms. Stewart's lethargic and non-effectual Bella. On the plus side, the scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was pretty decent. I can only hope that with the change of director, and the fact that the studio has seen how popular the movies COULD be, they increase the budget and buy a new CGI team and get their lead actors some ACTING lessons. <br /><br />Finally, a note to Stephanie Meyer. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT allow Hollywood to continue to destroy the wonderful world you created.

Horrible
This movie is just plain silly.  Vampires hanging out in high school hitting on less than legal teenage girls?  The vampires all tried to dress semi cool/edgy see also as(homosexually.)  It's a trashy plotless, rehashed love novel with vampires of questionable sexual orientation.  If you like this crap you need to probably get out of the house more often.

The Worst Vacuum
Can I give negative starage??  Trust me.  It is VERY heavy, (& I am NOT a tiny woman), cumbersome & difficult to maneuver; the attchments fall off as I'm vacuuming, the flexible hose drags on the floor so I am actually able to run over it when I back up!  Also, a teensy, tiny bag that fills up really fast and then it will start spewing dust and dirt onto the floor.  I will never again trust Consumer Reports' recommendations and I cannot believe all of the glowing reviews for this machine.

Proceed with Caution
I purchased this item from Amazon ($147).  From my experience the manufacturer has poor quality control.  <br />1) The box was missing a part (the wand). <br />2) The foot peddle is poorly designed and seems prone to damage<br />3) The belt fails to disengage when in the upright position; this caused the belt to slowly burn out.  This may be the cause of the belt problems others are complaining about.  This issue may be isolated to my machine, however, the poor foot peddle design makes me wonder if this product was fully thought out in the design stage.<br /><br />On the bright side, Amazon arranged for a UPS pick up at my home and provided a refund.  I'm happy with the Hoover UH50000 (Amazon $199) that I ordered in its place. <br />

Falls apart after a few months
I bought the Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-vac 3/19/09. It is now 7/25/09, and the vacuum is already falling apart. The vacuum was an okay one, but I accepted it's shortcomings, because it was cheap enough. It vacuums pretty well across several different floor surfaces (carpet, tile, laminate), but it was heavy, generated a lot of heat, attachments would fall off all the time, and switching between bare floors and carpet and between hose and floor was unnecessarily cumbersome. As I said I was willing to live with this, because of the price. My previous vacuum had been a $400 Dyson which was a nightmare, and I vowed never to spend that much on a vacuum again. But now, here I am, just over four months later, and the Eureka is no longer usuable. First, the cheap plastic wheels are falling off. Second, the switch that you turn to change from floor to hose no longer works properly, so that now I can't use anything but the hose. Basically what I have now is a really expensive Dust Buster. My floors are filthy and I can't vacuum. Other reviews have made reference to the cheap quality of this vacuum, and it falling apart after a few months. I should've listened. If you value your money, I would not recommend this vacuum.

Broke three times in less than a year!
I bought this vacuum less than a year ago and it just broke for the third time. I have no pets and no children.  There are no tough jobs that this vacuum has to deal with.  Yet, it keeps breaking down over crumbs! I regret not buying at a store that had a fix it year warrenty.

Don't buy this
It is amazing that any company wishing to protect the integrity of their brand name would sell any product that works this poorly. If you put in a new bag, it will pick up dirt for about 5 minutes, then won't even pick up Cheerios.  Forget trying to vacuum the sand off the hard wood floors.  To make it worse, the hose won't stay on the back and keeps falling in the way.  <br /><br />On the positive side it is fairly quiet for a vacuum, making it easy to hear all the grumbling about how poorly it works.

Poor Quality Control
This is my second, and last Boss. The first vacuum did an excellent job cleaning my carpet for 3 years, and then the motor died. I was disappointed, but accepted it due to it's age. I eagerly bought a second one and was happily vacuuming for 3 months... until the motor died.<br /><br />Sorry Eureka, never again.

BEWARE of the SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES between Kindle 1 and Kindle 2!
I was DELIGHTED to upgrade my Kindle 1 to K2...until I got down to using it every day.<br /><br />Having invested HEAVILY in Amazon Kindle content, I looked forward to the new and improved version! I really wanted to love this device just as much, if not more, than my original purchase! It was to be my "backup insurance" and "protect my investment" in Amazon content for the device. I expected and looked forward to everything Amazon said this device would be.<br /><br />Out of the box, and on the surface, big cosmetic changes for the better. Once I began using it, however, my experience became more and more frustrating.<br /><br />1. I have a tremendous volume of Kindle content (public domain and Amazon). I discovered that I could not directly transfer from my computer backup for Kindle 1 to the new K2 (why my backup is on the computer is addressed later in this review). All my content had to be reformatted by Amazon and re-downloaded from their site specifically for and to the Kindle 2 (I am NOT in a Whispernet area). Major pain. Major time-investment. Major inconvenience. Major turn-off. Have you guys ever heard of "bulk-download" capability, or choose many files at once for copy to a new device??? Guess not.<br /><br />2. All of my previous issues of magazines and newspapers were lost (ie, I could not re-download them specifically for the K2) because Amazon does not back up subscriptions on their server for more than 6 days. SINCE I PAID FOR THE CONTENT, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONTENT ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD. Sorry, but I won't consider buying any more newspapaers or magazine subscriptions to the Kindle 1 or 2. Several (Wall Street Journal, Reader's Digest) are less expensive online (with print edition also included) and have ALL content (not MIA content pictures, charts, quotes, etc).<br /><br />3. Several books I purchased read "Kindle 2" in the title, but were Kindle 1 books with a new title page. OOPS!<br /><br />4. Although Amazon says it keeps you content on their server, I found many instances where I could not download my books to my computer because the item THAT I PAID FOR was not available for download to my new Kindle2. Amazon said the book had been "pulled." Excuse me, but I paid for it, pulled or not, it should always be avaiable to me since I paid for it. When I asked for a refund for the pulled item now unavailable to me, SINCE I COULD NOT GET THE ITEM REDOWNLOADED, I was told that a refund was not possible. LESSON LEARNED: I now back up ALL my Kindle content on my computer. Since Amazon says "Don't worry, your content is safe with us." I respectfully disagree. Also, some authors issued new versions of their books for K2. However, then the original version for K1 "disappeared" from the server so I could not even download it to K2, nor K1. Same filename, so if I had been in a Whispernet area, the original would have been completely overwritten without my realizing it! Imagine, I bought a K2 Users Guide in May 2008, before it come off the engineers drafting table, instead of in February 2009!<br /><br />5. The "Jump-ahead" and "Jump-back" feature (so convenient in Kindle 1, expecially in those instances where a Table of Contents does not exist and/or does not work--too often, I am afraid, in Kindle content) is not a feature in the K2 due to publisher formatting issues for the Kindle 2. Except for the User Guide that comes pre-installed on the device, it works fine in that document! After you have paged tru a 500-page book one-page-at-a-time to get from Chapter 2 to Chapter 15, see how excited you are about a low battery and all the time it took to get there!<br /><br />6. The "Table of Contents" in many books is non-functional, frustrating in a 500 page book that you cannot "jump ahead" to Chapter 15 from Chapter 2. I reapeat this because of the level of angst it created in me for a device that was supposed to be "new and improved." See the above issue as well!!<br /><br />7. The Text-to-Speech feature just got put in limbo by the Authors Guild, so Amazon had to agree to let the publishers decide if this feature would be "enabled," or not, for a particular book. Leads me to think they may be forced to forgo this "experimental" feature in the future...hmmm!!!<br /><br />8. No way to choose left or right justification in the print of a book (like in K1). You get what you get. I, for one, find fully-justified text distracting. I prefer left-justified text. Publishers control this with their formatting. Please take note that it is not a negotiable issue in the K2.<br /><br />9. Content storage: NO SD CARD, NO SD CARD, NO SD CARD!!! With all my content (re-downloaded) on the Kindle 2, I had used 3/4 of the "expansive," yet limited (in my case) storage available on K2. Couple that with the trouble I had downloading my content from Amazon.com (again, no Whispernet available), and I was more than a little angry.<br /><br />10. NO USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY--Unless you buy the extended warranty for $65. After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out (per Amazon Kindle Customer Service). I guess you then get the added "priviledge" of re-downloading all your amazon Kindle content manually!!<br /><br />11. The 2-year extended warranty really isn't for 2 years after the original 1 year warranty ends (like most places offering extended warranties in addition to the factory warranty). This one REPLACES the Amazon 1 year warranty, so you get 2 years, period.<br /><br />12. NO FOLDERS OR OTHER WAY TO SORT CONTENT ACCORDING TO GENRE. I use SD cards for this on Kindle 1. No way on Kindle 2. So, if you have a large volume of content, too bad, so sad, you have to wade thru it all (if you, like me, have learned not to trust Amazon with your purchased content).<br /><br />13. Display screen: the white is really GREY, and to avoid considerable eye-strain I had to refresh pages (using ALT-G) every other page. Also, in the sunlight (outside), the screen washes out, making it impossible to read. If you are over 40, have cataracts, or otherwise don't have the vision of a 20-year old, have fun squinting (even with large fonts)!<br /><br />14. Home Screen: For whatever reason, Amazon decided to make the Font on the Home Screen (much) harder to read (much less bold) than on the K1. Also, if you select a book, the full title does not appear (as it does with K1). On Kindle 2, if the book has a long title, you must push the 5-way selector to the right to get the rest of the title.<br /><br />15. PRICE! NO INCLUDED COVER! NO DISCOUNT FOR EARLY ADOPTERS. See SonyStyle.com for details. They allow a trade-in and $100 discount to buy their newest reader if you have the previous version. Too bad they don't have Amazon's content!<br /><br />LASTLY--Amazon--I SENT MY KINDLE 2 BACK AND WILL WAIT FOR KINDLE 3. Meanwhile, I am buying a used Kindle 1 to protect my content investment with your company. Sorry, I think you laid an expensive egg that couldn't hatch and refuses to fly. My ugly duckling (K1) will wait for K3 (what I hope will be a swann).<br /><br />

Screen is defective (fades in sunlight) Amazon says replacement won't fix
I've had my Kindle 2 since 2/24 and I loved it at first.<br /><br />Today is the first day when we have had bright sunshine, so I took the Kindle out in the sun and was dismayed to see that the text (particularly near the center of the screen) faded within seconds. Alt-G refresh of the screen restored the text temporarily but further sun exposure resulted in screen fading.  This is not a problem with the Kindle 1.<br /><br />Ever since I got the Kindle 2, its text has been lighter than my K1, but not so much that I couldn't tolerate it The fading in sunlight makes the text virtually unreadable.<br /><br />I contacted customer support (and mind you I have the extended warranty that allegedly give you advance replacement) and was told that A REPLACEMENT WOULD NOT FIX EITHER OF THE PROBLEMS and that what I should do if I were dissatisfied is simply return the Kindle 2 and all the accessories I ordered for it.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am a very unhappy camper. If replacing my current K2 will not fix the problem, then that means that <br /><br />a) they have not identified the source of the problem and <br />b) that any K2 currently purchased will have a similarly defective screen.<br /><br />My advice: STAY AWAY FROM THE KINDLE 2 at least until Amazon acknowledges there is a problem and provides a fix. For me, I plan to stay away from the Kindle 2 forever. <br /><br />Thank heavens I didn't sell my Kindle 1!!<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Following the events above, I sent feedback to Amazon about how dissatisfied I was with Customer Support.  The next day I did get a call back from someone else in Kindle support who agreed to send a replacement Kindle 2 out ASAP.  It should arrive Tuesday and I will post followup once I have a chance to check it out in bright sun.  FWIW, however, I have decided to hang onto my K1 just in case.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 2:  After two replacements, I finally got a K2 that does reasonably well in terms of the darkness of the text and one on which the text does not fade in the sun.  I say "reasonably well" because the text is still noticeably lighter than the text on my K1.  <br /><br />Despite the lighter text, I prefer the K2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and I use if far more than my K1.

Product flawed - will probably die after 1 year
If I'd written this review 6 months ago it would have been 5 stars - yes there are some slightly annoying design elements in the Kindle but being able to download books anywhere and read them instantly is fantastic. I was flying on long trips 2 times a month and I loved my Kindle, recommending it to anyone who came near. However, after 13 months the screen on my Kindle simply died - I tried resetting, discharging completely and recharging etc, but no luck. Searching for "kindle screen problems" on Google showed me that a lot of people are having exactly the same problem. And when I spoke with Amazon customer service they confirmed that it's a fairly common complaint, and they haven't figured out a way to fix it, so the product is unrepairable. And the Kindle only has a 1 year warranty, so if this had happened at 11 months they would have replaced it without issue (still annoying but at least I'd have a Kindle). But at 13 months they tell me that there is nothing I can do other than buy a new one. I understand warranty limitations but this is a product design flaw that Amazon knows about and they should be doing more to support customers who encounter this issue.<br />$399 (which was the original price of the Kindle) for a product that only lasts a year is more than I can (or want to) afford. To top it off, there are books that I have purchased that I now can't read, and Amazon won't even refund me my money for those!

Fragile as a tea cup
I have owned the kindle 2 for about two months.  Overall happy with the quality of the display.  However, my daughter dropped it from a height of about 12 inches and now the display is ruined.  It was in the leather kindle cover.  The customer service rep said they are drop-tested, but c'mon, it should be able to take a little more wear and tear than this.  He offered to replace it for $200, but for me that puts the expense ratio over the limit.  For something that is meant to be portable and carried around, I am very disappointed that it broke so easily.

Loved my Kindle until I found out this...............
If your Kindle 1 breaks or you purchase a Kindle 2 all your Newspaper and Magazine issues will be UNREADABLE on the replacement or new device. <br /><br /><br />First, Amazon does not archive Newspaper and Magazine issues in your account for more than a few issues unlike when you purchase books.<br /><br />It is up to you to back up NPs and Magazines onto your computer to archive, for example The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker Magazine and etc.<br /><br />Here is the rub. Should you lose, receive a replacement Kindle 1, Kindle 2 or Kindle DX (warranty or otherwise) or upgrade and purchase the newest Kindle ALL past issues of Newspapers or Magazines that were downloaded to the ORIGINAL Kindle will be UNREADABLE on any subsequent Kindle even though it is registered to your account.<br /><br />Think about this for a moment. You BUY these periodicals and obtain the rights for your use, but if you purchase or replace your Kindle you have no further rights to read past issues YOU bought and paid for.<br /><br />One better hope that their Kindle never breaks because Amazon does not repair YOUR Kindle they replace it with another. Therefore no more use of your periodicals.<br /><br />Sound absurd? Well it is true. So much for a reference library.<br /><br />It is because of the Digital Rights Management (DRM) that is embedded in the file of the Newspaper or Magazine. It records the serial number of the original Kindle that the periodical was downloaded to. If you change Kindles, of course the serial number of the Kindle changes and therefore the file is Unusable on the new or replacement Kindle. (This is not the case with books) <br /><br />On one hand you can purchase a hard copy of a magazine or newspaper and let 1000 people read it, but now it turns out you can't even read a copy of the very one YOU purchased.<br /><br />For all the good that has come out of Kindle it amazes me some of the stupidity that has been built in to their policies. <br /><br />

The Problem with the Kindle or E-Readers
When you buy a book, you expect it to have a table of contents, index, bibliography, list of maps, list of figures, etc. that you can look up and then turn to the page.  The problem with Kindle and I expect E-readers is that while Amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, Amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification.   <br /><br />I bought the Kindle, not to read the latest book on the New York Times best seller list, but history books related to the Civil War, WWI, WWII, other non-fiction subjects and technical books.  <br /><br />Let me give you an example of the issue.  The Battle Cry of Freedom by McPherson doesn't have a table of contents that you can access from the menu page and the list of maps when you click on a link, takes you nowhere.  When you have a hard copy of a book, you thumb through it to see where the maps are but with the Kindle, forget it.  You cannot, unless you want to click next page 1000 times.  <br /><br />This example with McPherson's book is the rule not the exception.  I don't care what any of the comments that will come after I write this that will say something to the contrary, as they just Kindle LOVERS.  <br /><br />Amazon really needs to come up with a better way of reporting these issues other than having to call in to the support number and spend 10 minutes talking to someone, while very nice, is going to do nothing about it because its not within their power to affect change.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, it won't read complex PDF documents because Kindle doesn't support PDF natively.

Kindle Steals Books
Disclaimer:  I was on the fence on buying a Kindle and decided against it, here's my reasoning.<br /><br />The Amazon Kindle is a spiffy device.  It has a great look, a great interface and fulfills a great function.  I've wanted to get one of them for the last year or so but there have been a number of events that have prevented me from jumping on board.<br /><br />1. Text to speech.  When the Kindle 2.0 was released, it had a fantastic text-to-speech application included.  If I had a kindle, I probably wouldn't use it much, but I could see myself using it from time to time (like if I were driving or falling asleep to a book).  The writer's guild was worried that this would kill their books-on-tape sales, so they told Amazon.com to kill the functionality.  Amazon.com complied.  In fact, they didn't just pull the functionality from Kindles they had in their warehouse, they killed the functionality on all of the Kindles they had sold.<br /><br />People who had purchased the device, maybe even because it had text-to-speech, woke up one morning and found out that Amazon killed it from afar.<br /><br />Lesson 1:  Amazon.com can sell a Kindle claiming it does something, and then decide to remove that feature.<br /><br />2. If you lose your Amazon.com account, your Kindle becomes a brick.  Users who have lost their Amazon.com account have turned on their Kindles to find they they can no longer read the books associated with their account and can no longer download any new content to their device.  I don't plan on losing my Amazon.com account, but this is enough to keep me away. <br /><br />Lesson 2: If you have a fallout with Amazon.com, your device is a brick.  You do not own the device, even though you paid for it.<br /><br />3. Takesie-backsies.  If you buy a book and that publisher decides to stop publishing that book, it typically has no effect on you.  I have a number of out-of-print books on my bookshelf and I'm entirely confident that they will remain there until I disturb them.  This is not the case with the Amazon Kindle.  If a publisher decides to stop offering a book, Amazon.com removes it from your device on behalf of the publisher.  Its as if they decided not to offer a book anymore so they came into your house and took it off of your bookshelf.<br /><br />Lesson 3: You don't own what you pay for.  All of your content and the associated rights are still owned by Amazon and the Publisher.  If they decide to alter the agreement or remove the rights they've bestowed upon you, they can do it at any time and with zero notice.<br /><br />As much as I like the idea of the Kindle, I could never buy one having learned these things.  If I get an e-reader, I think I'll go with a sony.  It doesn't have the content delivery system that the Kindle has, but its a slicker device and there's no question as to whether you own the device and the data on it.<br />

Kindle problems - spelling and more
I purchased my Kindle 2.0.2 (309510017) in mid-March.  I have been using it to read "No Ordinary Time" by Doris Kerns Goodwin.  There are some very annoying features to your product.<br /><br />First, when you (Amazon) scan in a book, you should have a human being proof read it.  On 3 or 4 occasions now, I have come across the word "Mer."  At the moment I am at location 7774-79.  The sentence I am looking at reads  "Mer lunch, they settled down to talk..."  Maybe you can tell me what the correct word is, so I don't have to interrupt my reading to try to figure it out.<br /><br />Second, the screen contrast is poor.  The black-on-silver background is not nearly as easy to read as black-on-white. You should have the ability to adjust the screen contrast.<br /><br />Third, the screen glare is annoying.  I don't have a suggestion on how you overcome this, but it needs to be worked on.<br /><br />Fourth, your battery icon stinks.  It is so subtle that you can't tell how much battery life is left.  Why not simply make the used up area blank, instead of your "cute" gray scale?<br /><br />Fifth, pictures in a history book are a very important feature that need to been seen clearly.  Kindle does a poor job with photos -- which relates back to poor screen contrast.<br /><br />On the plus side - it is easy to use and much more convenient that toting a thick book around.  The cost savings of a downloaded book make it cost effective.  But the items above make it a marginal tool at best.<br /><br />Pete Trotter<br />The W5YI Group<br />trottr@msn.com

peeeuwww!!
I like the look and feel, however it smells so strongly of chemicals that I can't use it!  I liken it to an extreme "new carpet" smell, so potent that the odor lingers on my hands for about 2 long soapy hand scrubs! I tried to air it out to no avail... about 5 days, and still it is smelly!  Sorry Kindle, try again!

Toxic smell
I was deeply disappointed with this case. The description in the site makes it seem just perfect. However, the material is cheap synthetic leather imitation with felt inside, not even close to leather and suede as advertised. I could have lived with that if it weren't for the deeply objectionable and strong smell of toxic glue combined with synthetic material. I paid shipping and import duties and doubt Amazon will refund me on that. So learn from my experience, make yourself a favour and pass on this case.

It smelled!
I bought my g/f a kindle 2 and the Cole Haan leather cover. The Cole Haan is real nice and plush. Now she bought me the Kindle 2 but I went with the Amazon black leather cover with wraparound band. I thought it looked good on the website. Now that I have it, I think it's really cheap looking and feeling. Also, the felt inside feels of poor quality and the whole product smells bad. Maybe it smells bad because its right out of the box but I'm not sticking around to find out. I'm returning the Amazon cover and ordering a black Cole Haan for myself.

An insult to the Harry Potter series
First of all, let me start out by clarifying that I cannot say enough wonderful things about the seven books in the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling's books are among the greatest children's novels ever written, and if you don't already own the entire series in hardcover, then this boxed set is definitely a good deal. However, if you're looking for a snazzy collectible item, you are in for a major disappointment.<br /><br />When I first learned that a gift set of all the hardcover Harry Potter books was being released, I was thrilled. Even though I already own all of the books from this series in hardcover, the idea of owning a collectible gift set was very appealing to me, and I was more than willing to shell out extra money for something nice. Unfortunately, though, the quality of the packaging of this set is incredibly shabby. The seven beautiful books are lined up side by side in a flimsy cardboard box with a cheap plastic lock glued to one side. It's terrible! I think the publisher really missed the mark with this one. So many fans would pay top dollar for a beautiful Harry Potter gift set, but why would anyone want to invest in something that looks so crappy? <br /><br />A lot of other reviewers have remarked that people shouldn't be grumbling over the packaging. I disagree. Boxed sets in general are supposed to be special. Look at all the fancy book and DVD boxed sets available on the market at any given time. People are paying for the books or movies themselves, but they're also paying for the presentation. <br /><br />Overall, if you're just looking to buy a complete set of the books, you can't go wrong with this affordable gift set. However, if you're looking for a collector's item, pass this one up. I'm so glad I saw this gift set in person before I ordered it for myself...there is no way I'm buying it now.

Bollix
Like many others, I clearly recall the pre-order advertisement stating that this was a wooden box. Obviously, it is not. It is cheap cardboard not worthy of starting a decent fire. I had the books in hardcover long before this atrocity arrived at my door and had I known that the company would switch the promised product with this rubbish, obviously I would never have ordered it. What truly infuriates me is that this was supposed to be a birthday present for a beloved friend of mine. As it stands, I wouldn't give the box to her cat for its litter.<br /><br />(The books are quite nice, the one star relates only to the box.)

Flimsy cardboard box a dissapointment
Like the many other reviewers, I eagerly awaited this special set, only to be disappointed by the flimsy cheap looking box.  I do NOT recommend anyone ordering this product.  The hardbound books are great, but the box is a dud.

False Advertising
I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but I had to after receiving my Harry Potter "Box" set. I put box in quotes because it's not a box at all but cheap cardboard! What a ripoff! The picture clearly intends to portray it as a wooden box. It appears that either Amazon or Scholastic made an effort to conceal the fact that it wasn't wooden at all. I'm sure everyone purchased this item to receive the nice wooden crate, well don't waste your time! I have no complaint about the books, they're great. The false advertising in this picture is disgusting though!

....i read all 6 books for this ending?
I found this book to be extremely disappointing. Other reviews have gone extensively into the plot holes and screeching halt that character development (especially of the trio) came to. I won't rehash any of that here. <br /><br />My bone to pick is with the character resolution of Snape. I'm an older reader, so while I enjoyed the trio I was drawn more to the ambiguous character of Snape. His sarcastic/dry/dark/cruel personality contrasted with his continually saving Harry, being a member of the Order of the Phoenix and having Dumbledore's absolute trust drew me in. I really was curious to see how the contradictions would be resolved. <br /><br />I had a feeling when I read OotP how it would go down. As soon as I read the scene where Snape calls Lily a mudblood I knew there was more to their relationship... I immediately thought "oh no. Please don't let the sole reason for anything good in Snapes character be something so melodramatic as a decades unrequited love for Lily Potter." Alas...that was how it turned out. <br /><br />I was hoping to see some depth in Snape's reasons for turning on Voldemort. That Snape loved Lily, a person who died because of his actions, was a good starting point. But I felt like there should have been much more to what made Snape do the right thing at the end of the day. There were brief scenes involving a difficult childhood that were never elaborated on. A mention of Snapes mother but nothing more. There were strong parrallels between Harry, Snape and Voldemort that got one line in the last book.  For such a seemingly complex character the motivations of the majority of his actions turned out to be simplistic. The scene where he asks Dumbledore about the fate of his soul in regards to killing him, hints at depth but it never evolves. I would have like to see that his redemption started with his love for Lily Potter and grew from there. <br /><br />Unlike some reviews I've read, I wasn't terribly upset that Snape died.  I loved  the character but felt a happily ever after would have been difficult to write. Certainly possible but I wasn't expecting it.  I was more annoyed at how he died. I was hoping for a noble death. The revelation of whose side Snape was on was such a key point in the narrative. Harry especially owes his life several times over to Snape. Harry's success was as directly tied to Snape as it was to Dumbledore. It seemed so anticlimactic to kill him off before the final battle and before the final revelation of his loyalties. I had expected him to stand with Harry Potter and co in the end. After years of  prostrating himself before Voldemort he deserved the chance to tell the guy off.  <br /><br />One point in the resolution of the relationship between Snape and Harry really irked me. Snape was only protecting Harry out of a love for Lily so Snape really believed Harry to be the arrogant little brat he treated him as. I had honestly been expecting part of Snapes treatment of Harry to have been a way to keep a certain distance between a Death Eater and The Boy who Lived. If Snape was so excellent at reading minds wouldn't a glimpse into Harrys serve to change his? I couldn't reconcile a character capable of doing what Snape did with that sort of willful ignorance.<br /><br />In any case  Snape never lied to or manipulated Harry like Dumbledore did. He was a jerk to be sure, but his decision to protect Harry's life for its own sake never wavered. He never viewed the boy as a pawn as Dumbledore seemed to. In many ways Snape turned out to be the bravest (while still flawed) character in the novel. <br /><br />For me, Snape represented the moral struggle that I look for in fiction. Harry Potter and the gang were on the right side, they always had been and their victory against evil was inevitable from the first word of the Sorcerer's Stone. There was no real moral struggle in Harry Potter's story because there was never any conflict for him over whether or not to do the right thing. And what little there was can now be explained away by the piece of Voldemorts soul that Harry carried. Snape on the other hand had to struggle and earn his redemption. For Snape his good actions were a choice and for me those are always the most interesting characters.  The final unraveling of Snape felt like it should have been much less predictable, much less melodramatic and more complex than it was. In the end Snapes back story was another aha! moment in the text to magically (no pun intended) give the trio the exact knowledge they needed, at the exact moment they needed it to get one step closer to the final battle.(Was anyone else really sick of the pensieve conveying crucial information at this point?) And my oh my the final battle, anti-climactic and contrived come to mind.<br /><br />

I feel I have been cheated
Like most here, my wife and I had seen all these Harry Potter movies in the theater. Since then my wife read the books and wanted to see the movies again. So I bought them for her as a gift. She was very happy to get them and we decided to watch them one a night for a week. So we settled in for a week of entertainment.<br /><br />You can't imagine how irritating it is to expect to see something you know happens - that never happens. I.e., it has been deleted! Scenes have been deleted from several of the movies in this set. It was a very irritating experience. <br /><br />This has happened before with DVDs I have purchased and it is extremely infuriating. Why do they do this? They should at least have the courtesy to tell you that scenes that were in the theatrical release are deleted from the DVDs. That way you at least know what you are getting and can decide to buy or not. By deleting scenes on the sly, I believe they are selling an inferior product and, that way, feel they are putting something over on us dump consumers. <br /><br />I cannot rate this set more than one star because I feel I have been cheated.<br />

The only time I wished I lived in the UK...
So, I can see why they've priced this so high, because they're great movies.  I was even be tempted to buy them.  Unfortunately, at the amazon.com/uk store, they have the EXACT same set for 32 euros, which in US dollars, is $49.43. and that even includes shipping to the US!  Unfortunately the UK store obviously sells them in the different format from our good old US players.  But seriously, twice as expensive?  No thank you.  When the price drops down to $50, then I'll get them.

Don't waste your money if you value decent sound
Not going to make this pretty and wordy, because of time-constraints.. never the less.. here is my feedback <br /><br />I have this set also in regular DVD format. I have to say, I was very disappointed from the sound quality. All my other blue ray films are perfect with volume, this set is about half the sound (volume) I have to turn up my TV so ridiculously high.. the regular DVDs have a much better sound. I expected more from this blu-ray. <br /><br />My TV is state of the art LED and both my blue ray players as well (Playstation and Sony player) .. and given that all my other blu-ray's play fine.. I will have to assume that it is this set. It is so annoying that I just played the regular DVDs instead. <br /><br />Oh.. and when I put in the disc, it just plays the movie!! not even a menu to select scenes, sound etc.. !! absolutely ridiculous

Are you guys serious?
I don't get it. I just don't get it. I thought young adult fiction had hit its low point with Eragon, but apparently I was wrong. Bella Swan (literally, "beautiful swan," which should be a red flag to any discerning reader) moves to the rainy town of Forks, and the whining begins on page 1. She goes to live with her father Charlie, and is quickly established to be a mopey, ungrateful, self-pitying little toerag. Bella then attends her new school, which turns out to be an all-out caricature of high school with about zero (rounding up) grounding in real life. Her classmates' reaction can be summed up thusly: "OMG. NEW STUDENT. OMG YOU GUYS, NEW STUDENT. STARE AT HER, FOR SHE IS CLEARLY SUPERIOR TO US." Bella Sue is promptly adored by everyone in the school, except the mysterious Cullens, who spend their time brooding, being pretty, smoldering, being perfect, and sparkling. No, seriously. NO, SERIOUSLY. Bella meets Edward, the Culleniest of the Cullens, (meaning he is more perfect and emo than the rest of them,) they fall in love within thirty pages, (much of this time is spent in Bella's head going back and forth between "Does he like me?" "Does he hate me?" "Do I like him?" "Why does he hate me?" and on and on and on AND ON. That is, when she's not being a horrible snobby twit to the boys at school who show affection in genuinely sweet ways, i.e., not breaking into her house and watching her while she sleeps. While she sleeps. Not knowing that he's there. IN HER HOUSE.) The plot shows up somewhere in the last fifty pages, which involves an EVIIIIIILL vampire named James who wants to eat Bella. James is the only character I like.<br /><br />I generally try to find something redeeming about books, but I honestly have nothing good to say about this drivel. Meyer writes as if the reader is an absolute idiot who has to be told every sing tiny little thing; we are never given the chance to interpret what's going on in the characters' heads. There is no mystery, no intrigue, no suspense. The characters themselves are cut-and-dried, stereotypical, and maddeningly unoriginal. Bella's (supposedly) the clever, beautiful heroine, Edward's the dark, brooding bad boy, James is... uh, the guy that wants to eat Bella. Meyer clearly wants Bella to be a strong female character, but the horrible sad truth is that she's pathetic. Bella follows Edward's every word religiously, never sticks up for herself, has no spine to speak of, plays Suzie Housewife to her father, and has no existence outside of her "romance" with Edward. On that note, let it be said that Nathaniel Hawthorne got more romance into a few lines about a rosebush than Meyer managed to cram into 400 pages. Edward and Bella's relationship consists almost entirely of staring at each other dewey-eyed and arguing about who's prettier (NO I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP.) <br /><br />You know what? This could have been a great book if Meyer had focussed more on the relationship between the leads, (and treated it for what it is: unhealthy, creepy, pathetic, borderline psychopathic,) and less on how perfect Edward is (interesting note: the word "perfect" or related terms like "flawless" are used to describe Edward more than a hundred times. That's just bad writing, guys.) What burns me up most about this book is that Edward and Bella are obviously meant to portray the perfect couple. Yeah, I really want my hypothetical daughter to walk out on her family for a guy she barely knows, invite said guy to sleep in her bed, have absolutely no life outside of said guy, and turn into a sniveling wreck when this guy looks at her the wrong way. And I also really want my hypothetical son to break into his girlfriend's house and watch her sleep (SERIOUSLY, GUYS?) , abandon whatever life he has so he can stalk this girl, and be so possessive of her that he throws a fit whenever she so much as looks at someone other than him. And people think these two are good role models? WHAT. JUST WHAT.<br /><br />This book really wouldn't bother me if it were being taken for what it is: a silly, sappy, shallow, juvenile, wish-fulfilling rag. The fact is, everyone is going on about how its literary merit rivals the frakking "Scarlet Letter" and how Bella Swan is the new Elizabeth Bennet (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?). "Twilight" should be rotting on some publisher's desk in a pile of rejection letters; not being lauded as the greatest novel since "Pride and Prejudice." I weep for literature.

aromatic airhead meets vacuous vampire
I wanted to like this book.  For one thing, it came highly recommended by reputable reader-friends (sorry guys, nothing personal).  It took me a good 200 pages to even realize that I didn't like it, but as the pages slipped by, so did this book's potential to tell a convincing, complex and emotionally-gripping story.<br /><br />I didn't mind the slow start.  Bella Swan's teenage over-reaction that "the world is going to end, or at least suck for a while" when she moves from Phoenix to Forks, WA was a familiar yet believable theme for a young adult book.  I forgave her silly name and her paralyzing (literally) clumsiness.  For a while.<br /><br />Then Bella discovers the attractive, standoffish, teenage vampire clique.  Don't get me wrong, I knew there would be vampires.  I had hoped they would bring some intrigue, interesting character interaction, and a few creative supernatural twists to the mix.  I was wrong: Edward, the main vampire/love interest must be the most blatant example of author-male fantasy insertion in a story I have ever read--the way his beauty is praised ad-nauseum, as is his ability to out-play/perform/karate/run etc. every mortal/immortal on the planet in any game/sport/musical instrument/hand-to-hand combat/race etc. certainly attests to that.  Edward and his (almost) equally Hollywood Hot family are less creatures of the night, and more a blend of Greek god and barbie doll whose baseball games are confused for thunderstorms by us mortals.  They are also apparently perpetual high school students, moving to schools every few years to keep anyone from catching on.  Is this consistent with Meyer's view of noble "vegetarian" vampires who only want to alleviate the mortal misery of their weak human neighbors?  With Dr. Carlisle the one notable exception, I can't quite suspend my disbelief that a hundred years would NOT be enough time to fake your age, get into law school, med school, the foreign service branch of the state department...(or at least use certain inherent skills to become pool boys or tennis instructors).<br /><br />All this was mildly irritating, but what really brought the star-count down for me was that this book had so much potential to challenge my perception of the world, to make me think.  I kept reading because I expected there to be a twist...not a "gotcha" moment, but one where the characters grow too big for the box they've been placed in, where they become bold and try to deal with their issues.  I wanted to Bella to challenge the emotionally manipulative hold Edward has on her.  I wanted Edward to fail at something and discover humility, and even have to rely on Bella for a change.  I wanted Bella and Edward to discover that there are consequences for misinterpreting an attraction based scent/beauty for one based on communication, compromise, and time.  I kept reading, sure that something complex and meaningful would happen...<br /><br />I hope I don't spoil anything when I say that the characters start off in the shallow end, and end up in the pool parking lot.  When the action finally started at around pg 400, all I could think of was what one of the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000 sarcastically remarked during a B-movie that was being thoroughly panned: "And the reason this part works so well is that we care about the characters!"  If a random "bad guy" is suddenly going to appear at the end of a book and try to kill one of the main characters for no apparent reason, I want to at least care about them!  <br /><br />Finally, a brief note on the writing itself.  I thought some of the mood-setting description was pretty well done, and honestly didn't notice anything truly jarring until after the appearance of Edward.  Suddenly, cliches like "a carved statue", "an Adonis", "his angel face" surface at least every page or so, as do numerous purple descriptions of eye color meant to substitute for character depth.  Over-dramatic facial expressions abound, especially in the more intimate moments: grimaced, shuddered, gaped, glared.  And finally, the awkward dialog tags.  Characters "demand", "chuckle", "mutter bleakly", but never "say" anything unless they say it "harshly", "quietly" or "tenderly".  The line '"Yes", she agreed' made me laugh out loud.  All these "little" things, once I started noticing them, made the character's actions seem even more inconsequential and ridiculous.<br /><br />Bottom line:  obviously this isn't literature, but neither is it a thought-provoking or even "fun" frivolous read.  There just isn't any substance there to care about, no challenge, just a pretty boy and a "good-smelling" girl who needs to be rescued half a dozen times.  Some other reviews have compared this book to fan-fiction, and I think that's a fair assessment.  I've written overwrought fan-fiction in my time, complete with the "seagreen eyes" and "nymphlike shoulders" but that doesn't mean everyone's wish-fullfillment fantasy needs to blow into a doorstop of a book.<br /><br />For a more convincing and complex approach to the violence and passion inflicted by one man's uncanny sense of smell, try Patrick Suskind's book Perfume.

did anyone actually read this book before it went to print?
there are so many problems with this book that i can't even begin to address them all.  but i will say this, 'twilight' is probably one of the worst, if not THE worst, books i've ever read.  the writing is amateurish at best [cliches, stereotypes, purple prose--how anyone can applaud meyer's prose is puzzling]; the editing--or lack thereof--is appalling [this is a 200 page novel, no more and probably less];  the grammar and syntax are unforgivably bad; the plot is onion-skin thin; and the characters are uniformly dull and uninspiring.<br /><br />it's hard to imagine how so many people got suckered into this book. the novel's protagonist, bella swan [really? i mean, really?], is a complete idiot.  she has no dreams, no motivations, no ambitions, no hopes, no goals, and not a single original thought of her own.  she spends 500 pages spewing endless platitudes and commenting on edwards 'perfect face,' 'amber eyes,' and 'perfectly-muscled chest' ad nauseum [those references number in the HUNDREDS, easily]. she constantly wonders why edward, a 100-year old domineering vampire, wants her.  apparently she's the only one who doesn't realize how 'beautiful' she is. honestly, this is the kind of novel you'd expect see selling for $1.99 at the supermarket checkout, not winning all sorts of awards.  at one point i was half-expecting to close the book and find de-shirted fabio on the cover. and a glittery vampire? gimme a break.<br /><br />frankly, i'm mystified at its popularity. if nothing else, i guess it goes to show what clever marketing and stories of wish-fulfillment and so-called 'forbidden love' can do to some women. it's made meyer a multi-millionaire, i'm sure, and turned her publisher into a cash cow.  i don't begrudge anyone his or her success, but when it comes via a turd like 'twilight,' it's well, more than a tad saddening.<br /><br />what's even more disheartening are the 'twlight' apologists who say that 'at least young women are reading!' [as if reading trash is preferable to not reading at all.] i guess you could make that argument, but with that kind of logic you might as well congratulate an anorexic for eating a marshmallow. <br />

The legends are true; the vampires sparkle
I wasn't going to read this, but all the sparkly text and hystrionics on the internet piqued my curiosity.  It took a couple of goes to get into it, but once the story hooked me, I found it difficult to put the book down -- except for those moments when I had to stop and shriek at my friends, "SPARKLY VAMPIRES!" or "VAMPIRE BASEBALL!" or "WHY IS BELLA SO STUPID?"  These moments came increasingly often as I reached the climactic chapters, until I simply reached the point where I had to stop and flail around laughing. <br /><br />The plot revolves around Bella Swan, a Mary Sue whose primary skills seem to be having a martyr complex, attracting trouble, and falling down.  She moves to the rainy town of Forks to live with her father after some banal shenanigans make it impossible to live with her mother.  Or so she likes to claim, but like I said, one of Bella's superpowers is Being a Martyr.  At her new school, Bella is instantly feted as the queen of the social scene -- everyone likes her except (shock!) the impossibly beautiful Edward Cullen.  Who is a vampire.<br /><br />(Particularly grating is Bella's OUTRAGE that the normal boys of Forks like her and want to spend time with her, and express this by being friendly and openly indicating that they have a romantic interest in her.  I mean, sure, it's awkward being the subject of unwanted romantic attention -- or so I've heard -- but at least they're not playing creepy mind games and breaking into her house to watch her sleeping, because that would be -- oh, hang on...)<br /><br />Edward doesn't actually hate Bella, he simply lusts after her.  I mean, wants to suck her blood.  I mean, sniff after her creepily.  Bella apparently poses a threat to the entire non-evil vampiric subculture, so of course Edward asks her to go steady with him.  But not until they've spent many, many, many chapters engaged in tedious 'banter' that is possibly intended to remind the reader of Pride and Prejudice, or at least, remind the reader of some fanfic based on a loose film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. <br /><br />Then they hook up, and Edward glitters in the sun a bit.<br /><br />Then some evil vampires turn up, one of whom is obsessed with Bella.  Why?  Because her blood just smells that good.  Apparently there are sequels -- well, there's no "apparently" about it, I can see the sequels from where I'm sitting -- but unless they involve Bella Swan and the entire town of Forks being obliterated in a nuclear devastation, I don't intend to read them.<br /><br />Twilight should be taken as mindless fun, but it has a lot of subtextual ugliness that makes its popularity disquieting.  Bella is one of the most useless, insipid heroines I've encountered in a long time -- and I genuinely love Fanny Price, btw -- while Edward is like a textbook example of a creepy stalker boyfriend.  There's a strong element of wish fulfillment -- average girl attracts bad boy who's willing to change for her -- but I cannot be comfortable with a text that portrays abuse as love.  Apparently, the series is popular for its abstinence subtext -- Edward and Bella can't be together until their relationship has taken the proper form, that is, Bella's a vampire -- but possibly parents should be wondering if it's really a good idea to conflate "marriage" with "death". <br /><br />Or, possibly, I'm overthinking.  When a series has become this massive, I don't think it hurts to give some serious brain-time to the question of what, exactly, is being consumed.

Contrived and formulaic
The quick version of this book: If you're pretty and pouty, you too can land yourself a gorgeous vampire boyfriend who will continuously save your a**.<br /><br />Let's take our main character first - Bella Swann. Yet another heroine who doesn't know she's beautiful and describes herself as shy but never exhibits the trait. The book is told in first person, which is unfortunate, because that means the reader is at ground zero for all of her insipid thoughts. She moves in with her father in his small town and holds contempt for just about everyone she meets at school, even though all they are doing is being friendly and including her. Not that any of this matters to Bella once she spots beautiful Edward. The next 500 pages are filled with purple descriptions of his magnificence, of how she's not worthy, of how could this god-like/Adonis-like creature stoop to love her.<br /><br />I'm going to try to condense my irritation with Bella into a series of points:<br />    * She's ridiculously clumsy, which is meant to be a fault, is passed off as charming, but basically just gives her an asinine reason not to run so Edward can save her.<br />    * She "falls in love" with Edward within weeks of knowing him, and after a couple hundred pages, if he even mentions leaving, she hyperventilates and acts like her world will freaking collapse. Stalking is illegal in all 50 states, Bella.<br />    * Whenever Eddikens so much as barely brushes his lips with hers, she either tries to rip his clothes off (natural) or her heart stops beating and she passes out. The girl hit the floor so many times in this book she put Giles to shame.<br /><br />Which brings me to Edward. Angsty telepathic vampire Edward. While we have very little clear idea what Bella looks like, we get to hear about Eddiken's gorgeous, transcendental face and body over and over and over again. He's impossibly frustrating because he's been crammed with so many character traits, depending entirely on what the author wants him to be like at the time. He calls himself a monster and thinks he should have died all those years ago, but then totally lords his awesomeness over the mundane humans. And he is awesome. Lest you forget it, he's even awesomer than the rest of his vampire family at everything. <br /><br />But the worst part about Edward is how he treats Bella. He is initially attracted to her because her smell is particularly attractive to him (okay, I'll bite) and because he can't read her thoughts. (Trust me, Eddikens, I'm lookin' right at 'em, and there ain't nothin' up there worth wondering about.) He knows he's a danger to her (woe!) and tells her straight off that it's better if they not be around each other (sorrow!)...and then he proceeds to hang all over her! He berates himself once every few pages for putting her in danger but never has the guts to fix the matter because he "just can't stay away from her" and "[she's his] life now." *wretch*<br /><br />The author's writing style is unimpressive. Not bad, per se, but it wasn't giving me anything new. It all felt rather generic. Her vampires weren't bad - the "ultimate predators" and all that - but they were slightly ruined by her reasoning of why vamps can't go out in the sun. It's not because they'll burn up and die - it's because they glitter. That's right - these are GlamRock!Vampires. I also can see how Bella never takes Edward seriously when he tells her he's dangerous and she shouldn't want to be cursed with vampirism. Honestly, the author never shows us anything negative about the condition. It's all quick reflexes, superiority and baseball games with the fam.<br /><br />The plot is bogus. Four hundred pages of ill-conceived romance and then a quick 100 pages of worse-conceived conflict. The romance, to put it frankly, is a little disturbing in how it borders on the obsessive, especially on Bella's side because he's just so, so, so beautiful!<br /><br />And that's what bothers me the most about this book and the message that it sends to all of its rabid readers: the importance of beauty. Not inner beauty, either. Edward and his wonderful vampire family (all of whom are good because they don't feed on humans) are described over and over again in all of their wonderful physical qualities. They're cardboard characters for us to admire. Bella, of course, doesn't think of herself as beautiful, but the fact that she has four other boys in addition to the vampire falling all over themselves to please her begs to differ. I was willing to forgive the beauty of the vampires as a trait they acquire when they're turned, but a few others turn up later that are described as "nondescript" and ordinary-looking. And of course, they turn out to be the bad guys. Really, Stephanie Meyer?<br /><br />I'm not buying it.  Or your sequels for that matter.

Oh man.  I can't believe I spent nine bucks on this.
I started this book two days ago.  I'm currently more than 200 pages in, and I can't finish this, man. I just don't think I have the strength.<br /><br />Seriously?  This is what everyone is freaking out over?  I've read better fan fiction on Livejournal.  Really, truly, waaaaaay better.  Like, with sparkling, funny, romantic dialogue, great characters, the whole shebang.  This book is..well, crap.  Sorry, I tried to like it, but...yeah.  No go.<br /><br />The major problem I have is that I just don't care about any of the characters.  Meyer's character development isn't just lacking...it's absent.  I don't know these people, and therefore I don't care about them.  Describing their appearance (barely) isn't an adequate substitute for developing their personalities.  Also, they make no sense.  Is Bella a hottie?  A plane Jane?  Who the heck can tell?  Boys at her old school don't know she's alive, but the second she gets to Forks she's Miss America.  Boys in Phoenix are blind, maybe?  There's a toxic waste dump in Forks that makes all the native residents fugly, and Bella is hawt by comparison?  What is it, Stephenie?  Come on now.  How can I like this protagonist?  Bella is boring.  She's not funny, she's not even mildly amusing.  All she does is fawn over Edward.  I know that teenage girls always have and always will fawn over boys, but really, this is ridiculous. That's the only freaking thing she does.  Everyone else has said this, but she's really only just a sounding board for wonderful, perfect, muscular, adonis-like, perfect faced Edward.  She could have had one aspiration at least, yeah?  Some Mary-Sues have aspirations, right?  Right?<br /><br />Note to Stephenie Meyer: Use a thesaurus and come up with some new words, please.  She said clumsily.  While glaring.  And blushing.

That was a waste of a night
After hearing so much raving at my high school about how amazing this book is, I finally decided to pick it up as a guilty pleasure. I'd browsed through it in the book store, and I knew not to expect much, but I at least expected to enjoy it (guiltily) for the aspects that have made this book so popular among teens. I expected a sexy hero, compromising situations, and at least some action.<br /> <br />However, this book was awful. The characters were so paper thin two dimensional doesn't even begin to cover it. The language was awful and repetitive. Meyer repeats descriptions every third sentence or so, constantly ramming down the reader's throats how "beautiful" and "perfect" Edward Cullen is. She doesn't seem to realize that no matter how many times she uses either word, neither is an actual description. Never does Meyer seem to have come up with an original sentence, not a single original use of figurative language to describe anything, merely clichés every other line or so about how "beautiful" Edward's eyes are.<br /><br />Neither Edward nor Bella, nor anyone else, seems to have a shred of personality. Many of the characters of the novel seem superfluous altogether. As other reviewers pointed out, was there any point at all for any of Bella's many admirers other than to showcase how beautiful Bella is supposed to be? And is it just me or were there more members of the Cullen family than was altogether necessary?<br /> <br />After reading this novel, I've come to the conclusion that Meyer has never been in love. This is more like a deluded fourteen year old's idea of 'true love' than anything solid. Bella needs help. She falls in 'love' with Edward solely for his good looks within a couple of days and is incapable of thinking of anything else. Every thought, every word is fawning over Edward's looks. She never seems to have anything to say about him except for his smoldering eyes, his smoldering voice, his male model body. The girl is seriously sick. Even when her mother's life is in lethal danger and she's knowingly walking towards her death all she can think about is how much she regrets not being able to be with her new boyfriend. Sick, anyone?<br /><br />For a work whose sole attraction is that it aims to be unabashedly smutty and fluffy and alluring to teenage girls, it's ultimate crime is that it's BORING. Bella's life is incredibly uninteresting, and Meyer gives a detailed description of everything the girl says or thinks or does for 500 pages (hint: it all has to do with Edward's perfect eyes/body/sparkly skin). There is not a trace of action until the last 100 pages or so, and that is thrown in and concluded so hastily that it hardly saves the work. We end up learning information about Edward's sister Alice in the last chapter or so, but we have such a poor picture of Alice that it doesn't make much of an impact on the reader at all.<br /><br />The truth is, heros are often as attractive for their flaws as for their better qualities. Edward and the entire Cullen family are entirely perfect. They're so beautiful it's practically painful, but no excuse for this is given. Evil vampires are apparently nondescript. Edward is the most perfect of his entire perfect family. He never says anything that upsets, he's interested in every detail of Bella's pathetic life, even when he does do something disturbing it's 'cute' and he never has anything interesting or thoughtful to say. A hero that is perfectly perfect in every possible way under the sun, as Mrs. Meyer won't let you forget, is no fun at all.

Wow. And I don't mean that in the good way
When I dislike a book, I often don't dwell on it, because what's the point, right? But my reaction to this book went BEYOND dislike, and I felt I had to vent about it a little bit to get it out of my system. <br /><br />This book was horrible. Absolutely horrible. I bought it because it was featured in a magazine I read, and I'd heard good things about it, so I decided to give it a try...as a die-hard fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and fantasy literature in general, I thought it was right up my alley. I was wrong.<br /><br />First of all, I was *disgusted* by the main characters. I actually think one can dislike a character and still like the book/writing, but in this case, the main characters were pathetic and boring. The female lead (Bella Swan. Really. Bella Swan. Why not just call her Pretty McPerfect and have done with it?) is completely vapid. She has no goals, no dreams, no ambition, no personality aside from being miserable and obsessed with her boyfriend. Now, ok, it's romance. Fine. But romance can be accomplished...and often in a better way...if the participants have strong, defining character traits. It heightens the tension and makes the results much more satisfying. Bella had no defining character traits. I don't even remember what she was supposed to look like. She was selfish and misanthropic for absolutely no reason, and she acted like a spoiled martyr for far too many pages. It's really quite depressing that this book is being touted for teenage girls, because the main character is a HORRIBLE role model in every sense of the word. Why not portray her as having goals? Dreams? Ambitions? It would serve to heighten the conflict and make the book better in the long run.<br /><br />But anyway. The love interest, superhot vampire Edward, is downright scary. And not in like...the good way. He stalks her. He makes decisions for her. He doesn't listen to her views or opinions (not that she has any, really). He encourages her to lie. He puts her in danger...no matter how many times he whines about the emotional toll it puts on him, he still doesn't stop putting her in danger. He is cruel and arrogant. AND SHE ACCEPTS THIS! He keeps telling her how she needs him to look after her, how she would die or something if it wasn't for him. AND SHE IS NOT OFFENDED/ANNOYED BY THIS. Seriously! Even the most ambivalent feminist should find this insulting and derogatory! <br /><br />There's absolutely no chemistry between the leads. She loves him because he is beautiful. He loves her because he wants to eat her and she smells good. Really. He tells her she is like his heroin. How is that in anyway healthy? She is willing to die for someone she barely knows, someone who plays mind games with her, who dominates her completely. She admits to being completely obsessed with him. And there are no consequences for this! She has no doubts about her emotions toward him!<br /><br />Ugh. I could go on, but I won't. I just want to say that this is probably the worst book I have ever read, and I'm not too far removed from the teen audience this book is geared to. I see no redeeming features at ALL, except perhaps the character Jacob, who seems like the only person in this entire book that has any interesting and healthy character traits. But now that I've gotten this out of my system, I do feel better. <br /><br />In short...please don't read this book. Please.

Where are all the mothers out there?
I was given Twilight to read by a 14-year-old daughter of a friend.  She practically glowed when describing it.  I borrowed her copy and finished it in about 24 hours.  As I read, I became more and more disturbed by what I was seeing.  While it's a page-turner and certainly draws you in, the book is poorly written and extremely superficial.  But that's not the problem.  Pretend for a moment that Edward is not a vampire, but merely a controlling, obsessive, dangerous, violent, stalking, unpredictable, unstable human male.  Try re-reading some of the main characters' conversations with that in mind.  As a mother, I'm not so worried about my daughter falling in love with a vampire.  What I am worried about is her being influenced by the kind of all-too-human male I've just described.  And Bella is the worst possible heroine.  She puts herself at mortal risk over and over simply to satisfy her own physical desires.  She is ready in an instant to sacrifice her whole life for some ridiculous idea of love that is obviously just intense sexual attraction.  Is that what we want modeled for our daughters?  Do we want them to think that it's okay to give in to their feelings even when they go against everything we have tried to teach them, much less their own common sense?  Or do we want them to be self-controlled, self-confident, inspired, patient, hopeful, smart, accomplished, sensible, and wise?  I am afraid that by romanticizing this kind of unhealthy relationship, Meyers gives her young readers permission to be victims, as long as it's all for love.  Don't we see enough of the results of that every day on the news?  I understand why teenagers might fall for this erotic daydream, but where are all the outraged mature women who should be setting the record straight?  Why are they giving their silent (and not so silent) approval to this regrettable book?

I had high hopes
I finally got around to reading Twilight last week.  I wanted so much to love this book, because like Meyer, I am a stay at home mom, and a Mormon.  I live minutes away from BYU where she was an English Major. All my "mommy" friends around the neighborhood were "sucked in" by it.  One of my friends even said, "It brought me back to high school".  I have decided that I need new friends. <br /><br />The Good:  I never once had to refer to a dictionary.  The words were simple and easy to understand.  The cover was appealing. Chapter 1 had several metaphors that I appreciated visually.  For example "I flushed tomato red" and "the teacher droned on." <br /><br />The Bad:  There were several typos.  The lack of plot twists and turns left the story flat.  There wasn't a story within the story.  Perhaps there was a glimpse of a possible story between Jessica and Mike.  The majority of the dialog was between Bella and Edward.  <br /><br />The Ugly:  I could not stomach the relationship between Bella and Edward.  Edward's tone towards Bella was that of amusement and lust. That kind of shallow thinking is certainly not grounds for the affection of any normal human being.  Bella is not normal, however.  She is addicted to him and can't see past his subtle rebuke.  She can't see past his beautiful face, eyes, and smell.  There is no tenderness or kindness toward one another that would resemble love in any form.  Where there is true love there is pain, joy, and sacrifice.  On page 305, Edward answers Bellas concern that he has waited over 100 years to find her.  He answers, "You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me,...You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity....what's that worth?"   Her response is typical of her shallow character, "Very little - I don't feel deprived of anything."  That is where I am in the book. That is where I will stop.  Maybe someday I will pick it up and finish it.  I do wish Stephenie all the success in the world.  Do you know the saddest part for me is from Stephenie Meyer's own words about a reject letter she received from an editor, "I'll admit that I considered sending back a copy of that rejection stapled to the write-up my deal got in Publisher's Weekly, but I took the higher road."  As if a "deal" has anything to do with quality.

Let me tell you a little story of my own.
I know I can not be alone in this experience. <br /><br />Once upon a time I was in a happy relationship. Then this book happened. I thought nothing of it the first day I saw her sitting down with a book about vampires. Trouble started brewing.<br /><br />It started subtle and innocent. Little comments and sighs about how Edward was great. I didn't think anything of it, because we both knew Edward didn't actually exist. Then she started to talk about Edward as if he actually existed, and that's when things went wrong.<br /><br />Thanks to this fairy tale of a book, she thought a perfect guy existed. <br /><br />Now I was supposed to be a gentleman. She listed traits I knew she quoted out of the book that she wanted to see in me. Before long, she even directly said "You should be more like Edward." I thought this was just a phase. That she would get out of it. That there was no way she could possibly be setting a bar set by a fictional character. <br /><br />Well she didn't grow out of it. When the movie came out, things went really bad. All of a sudden she's drooling over Robert Pattenson(sp?) like a dog over a bone. Now she's staying I should style my hair like Edward's. Posters. Life size cutout. Her expectations grew, and grew...until she wanted Edward. <br /><br />In the long run, she left me. I wasn't Edward. A week later she's dating some guy who she says "actually knows how to be a gentlemen". He's a DB player with a nice car. I pity the both of them.<br /><br />Don't let your daughters read this. Don't let you girlfriends read this. Don't even let your grandma read this. They will get the idea of a perfect man in their head, a perfect romance. They will chase after perfection and never be able to find it. <br /><br />

I couldn't get past the first three chapters
I have a rule when reading books, that if I'm hooked by the time I finish the third chapter, I keep reading it. Publishers routinely ask for the first three chapters of a manuscript as a submission, and experience has proven to me that it's a good rule to follow. That said, as stated in the title for this review, I could not for the life of me get past the first three chapters without wanting to throw this book across the room, which is something I've done only once before in my entire life, and that was with the equally god-awful "Da Vinci Code"; I have a concern for the well-being of books, worthy of a 13th century monk, back in the days before printing when books had to be painstakingly copied by hand, letter for letter and word for word. <br /><br />The characters aren't even cardboard: they're tissue-paper thin. The dialogue put my teeth on edge for its triteness. Bella has to be the most anNOYing protagonist I have ever met. She's like one of those apathetic teenaged girls who cashier in a grocery store and can't be arsed to even be polite to the customers (yes, I work grocery retail). I honestly wanted to reach into the book and smack her across the face to see if that would elicit any emotion from her beyond her constant "Wah, wah, blah blah blah, life sucks, everyone sucks." Mind you, I don't mind books with unsympathetic protagonists, but this is one of those cases where your patience gets tested to the limits.<br /><br />I don't mind a slow start to a story, as long as the writer can make that slow start one you enjoy. But the start to this was so slow, it felt like walking in mud and I started looking for some solid ground to step onto. Unfortunately, this story doesn't offer any. The fact that a book like this got published doesn't bode well for the publishing industry, and it makes me wonder if people have lowered their standards in reading so much they'll go crazy over anything. I'm trying not to be an elitist here -- I didn't expect this book to be Shakespeare (and even Shakespeare wrote a few clunkers) -- I came to this book with an open mind and heart, but unfortunately, the badness of it obliged me to put it down before I got upset with it.<br /><br />Before the fangirls start hating on me for this review, I'd better add that I'm thirty-one years old, I've read probably several thousand books in my lifetime, I majored in literature in college, and I used to publish a small science fiction 'zine before I had to discontinue it for lack of time, help and funding. As Dr. Phil would say, "This ain't my first rodeo"; I know bad writing when I read it and sad to say, this is one of the worst books I've ever tried to read.

Absurd
With all the hype surrounding it, I decided to read it and satisfy my curiosity.<br /><br />This book starts out with Bella Swan (I tried to pretend that name wasn't cliche, but I failed) angsting over how she was moving to a town she hated for the sake of her mom. This angsting went on for quite awhile, from the moment the book started to...well, the very end of the book. The only difference being she went from angsting about the town to about Edward and how much she loves him and how much her life sucks. She would have spent time with her nice new friends at school, except she was too busy swooning over a rude (albeit gorgeous, a fact mentioned far too many times) boy from biology...the fabulous sparkly Edward Cullen. As a result, she treats all her new friends terribly and continues to do so throughout the series. Great message, right? It's okay to treat your friends badly as long as you have a super hot boyfriend. Whoo.<br /><br />The Edward Affair starts when she is rescued by him by the Convenient Car Crash O'Doom and regrettably lasts far longer than it should and really just involves more angsting, growing steadily worse when she learns he's a vampire and they Can Never Be. Woe alas. Do you hear that? It is the sound of the world's smallest violin playing sad music for their plight.<br /><br />The characters are unsympathetic, with Bella being melodramatic and ungrateful to those who care about her and willing to give up her life, her future, and everything she is to be with Edward. She has no life outside of Edward, no interests, no dreams save to be with him. She's a flat, one-dimensional character who bored me to tears. Edward was rude, overbearing, and obsessive, certainly not the sort of guy I'd ever be attracted to and would be seriously worried if any of my friends were.<br /><br />The action doesn't happen until the last third of the book, and it's not much after you wade through all the angsting and melodramatic fluff. <br /><br />I think even kung fu pandas couldn't have saved this book. I honestly don't know why it's so popular.

Obsessive? More like depressive
I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. Granted, this friend typically reads lighter, fluffier books than I do, but after how much she raved about it I thought it would be better than this.<br /><br />As an aspiring author and current editor, I couldn't help but be unimpressed by the prose. Calling it stilted would be an understatement. Also, I'm no battologist, but did Mrs. Meyer *have* to use the same exact words for descriptions every time? (Examples: "perfect", "amber", "glare"--my "glare" count reached 50 before I gave up counting.) <br /><br />Keeping in mind that this is a young adult novel (I am, for the record, considered a "young adult"), I may have forgiven the above stylistic flaws if not for the plot. Isabella "Bella" Swan (is she kidding with that name?!)falls for the apparently perfect Edward Cullen. He reciprocates because he is a vampire and likes her smell(?). The rest of the book deals with the author's "damsel in distress" syndrome (we don't even get to really *see* the final conflict), with a thrown-together action plot at the end.<br /><br />Now, a few questions. Did Anne Rice not write the vampire chronicles? Did L.J. Smith not write "The Vampire Diaries"? Yes? Then why was this book necessary? I don't quite understand. Vampires have, if I may be forgiven the expression, been done to death. Not only that, but they've been handled with much more skill by other authors. The message "Twilight" sends, what with Bella always being in danger and Edward *always* coming to save her, is not a positive or enlightened one for the women and girls who read it. The story may seem novel to infrequent readers, but seasoned readers see it all the time. <br /><br />Also, for a plot so centralized around the romance between Bella and Edward, I expected there to be more chemistry between them. Never mind the fact that the author uses the excuse of Edward becoming dangerously violent when they so much as kiss and hold hands, or that Mrs. Meyer is a Mormon and premarital sex is definitely out. But--and hear me out, here--even physical contact and expression (beyond glaring and arguing with each other all the time) that is chaste between people who (supposedly) love each other can communicate their feelings very well. Who hasn't hugged their sweetie from behind to surprise them, or lingered just a little too long in a room just because they're in it? Even smaller things: when the person you love's in the room, you'd expect to be happy, not pouty and angsty, especially at the beginning of a relationship when everything is so new and fresh. A squeeze on the shoulder or a kind word at the right time can say so very much about any such relationship. Judging from the relative lack of the aforementioned examples of showing care in "Twilight," I can only conclude that Mrs. Meyer has never been in love, or that she has a twisted idea of what "love" means. Another good thing to teach the children, eh?<br /><br />If you think I'm wrong, think about how often Edward actually physically restrains Bella and get back to me. If I were in such an abusive relationship I'd get out, not become even more in love.<br /><br />I'd like to say the book had potential, but I don't think it did. That it's page-turning in a cheap sort of way can't be denied. And now, what you've all been waiting for. . .<br /><br />Fangirls! Ready to rip me to shreds?

Are You KIDDING Me?
I understand setting. And build up. And suspense. So after reading 100  pages of this book, I didn't give it too much thought that nothing had happened. Here is my report of what happened after that:<br /><br />200 pages: Nothing has happened.<br /><br />300 pages: Nothing has happened. <br /><br />350 pages: Nothing has happened.<br /><br />400 pages: NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.<br /><br />Are you Kidding me?<br /><br />Wait. WAIT. On page 441, something happens. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. O my God, this is it. Something is really going to happen! I plodded through this padded wasteland and finally something is going to happen!<br /><br />Oh. Wait. It's resolved by page 451. <br /><br />I'm not making this up.<br /><br />So let me sum it up for you. <br /><br />Bella falls for Edward because he is attractive (we are told he looks like an "angel" "is angelic" "is seraphic" and oh, again, "looks like an angel," on about pages 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 17, 20, 33, 34, 35, 40, 44 . . . you get the idea. I understand that "angel" might not be in a thesaurus, but FOR GODDSAKES, find a new description. Also, his hair is described, alternately, as auburn and bronze. Did anyone else have a problem with the fact that these are completely different colors? Seriously.<br /><br />So Bella loves Edward for his looks. How precious.<br /><br />Edward loves Bella for her smell. <br /><br />What a beautiful, timeless romance. <br /><br />Spare me. <br /><br />Also, was anyone painfully unimpressed with the whole Alice side-story? Meyer obviously planted the hints about Alice's missing memory, only to explain it away later to *shock and surprise* us, with something completely uninteresting. It's like the saying goes: if you see a gun in chapter one, it's going to go off in chapter three. But if the gun goes off in chapter three during target practice and only manages to hit a tree branch, did it even NEED to be in chapter one in the first place? The Alice thing was pointless. Call me when you have a real twist.<br /><br />I imagine this book is lovely for ambitious twelve year olds who want to tackle a five hundred page novel. They will find it easy to do so, because Twilight reads like a painfully long letter an immature but stuck-up pre-adolescent writes to her pen pal. <br /><br />I am SO SAD this passes for good teenage fiction.<br /><br />And this is why, when someone announces she writes Young Adult fiction, that people say, "Why don't you want to write real books?"<br /><br />And that<br />Sucks.

I really wanted to enjoy this book...
***Of course there are spoilers below, sorry!***<br /><br />OK, so after hearing about this book for ages, after having dozens of friends recommend it to me and hearing them laud it as the "next Harry Potter", I decided to pick up Twilight. Some quick  background info on me (not really important, but just so you see where I'm coming from): I'm female, in my early 20's, LOVE fantasy and YA, LOVED BTVS and ANGEL w/ a fiery passion. Anyways, so I, and many others who know me, figured I'd love this book to pieces. Just finished reading it, and frankly, I thought it was horrible. The issues I have w/ this book are plentiful, and, this late into the game, have likely been discussed in other reviews, so to be brief (ok, not that brief):<br /><br />1) Bella is the worst protagonist ever. She is the typical "Mary Sue" character (a quick glance at 1 star reviews also mention this, so I won't go into definitions of what a Mary Sue is). She's a big city girl coming to live in a small town where everyone knows her name and wants to be her friend. Guys line up and actually fight for the "privilege" to take her to a dance, yet she dismisses these friendly advances as annoyances. Her only flaw is that she's hopelessly clumsy, but even this isn't really a flaw since it makes her endearing and provides ample opportunity for a dashing man to sweep her off her feet. Oh, and this happens often. My main beef w/ Bella is that, as a main character, she does absolutely nothing to resolve the main conflict. In my opinion, this is a big no-no, especially in YA literature. Protags should be the one to resolve the conflict and not rely on other characters so heavily to do so. Bella is the quintessential "damsel in distress" who seem to only exist to get into grave peril so her dashing man can rescue her. In a world of strong YA protags who make heavy, sometimes life altering decisions to resolve a conflict, this is such a cop-out. Bella is just a victim and I would have had more respect for her is she had found a way to outsmart the villain and save herself. Bella herself says it best, she is the perpetual Lois Lane, and there's a reason why Lois never starred in her own movie/show! (now, don't get me wrong, I'm not some zealous feminist that hates this archetype, I feel that characters like these can serve a purpose in a well written story, just not as a protag/MC)<br /><br />2) Edward is unbelievably boring. For a mysterious "creature of the night", Edward is an incredibly dull "Gary Stu". He's perfect in every way: perfect looks;  super powerful; perfect looks; super fast; perfect looks; can play the piano like freaking Mozart; perfect looks; sparkles like a giant diamond engagement ring in the sun; perfect looks; is, for some absurd, mostly chemical, reason, completely devoted to Bella; and oh, he has perfect looks. Meyer seems to think it is important to mention his beauty, his perfection, his angelic, Adonis-like, model looks on a VERY regular basis (I swear, it was mentioned almost every other paragraph in one chapter). He's so oh-my-gosh beautiful, Bella literally faints every time he even touches her (but that's ok, it gives him yet another excuse to sweep her off her feet!). We get very little about his past (should I hope to see more of this in the sequels?) even though we get an entire chapter, really, almost 1.5 chapters, on the origins of Carlisle, a vampire who plays a minor role in this story.  His mood changes rapidly from anger to condescending, back to anger, to undying devotion, exasperation, then, again, back to anger w/ a bit of mockery. Other than his mostly chemical attraction (and really, it is mostly chemical. Bella seems to let off some sort of exotic smell that makes vamps go wild), little is known about him, about what drives him to do the things he does.<br /><br />3) Sparkling vampires? Look, I know vampires have been done in all forms of media for decades and I appreciate some originality. But really, vampires that sparkle in the sunlight? Meyer gives us no reason why they should sparkle, doesn't explain how this works, really, just uses it has some vague excuse why the vamps can't go out in bright sunlight. So overall, besides the drinking human blood aspect, which can obviously be overcome, there is no disadvantage whatsoever to becoming a vampire. You remain young and oh-my-gosh beautiful for eternity, become super fast and strong, get cool powers like telepathy, clairvoyance, and, well, whatever it is Jasper has, drive around in luxury cars, and basically, other than a troublesome Native American tribe, can live the good life. I would have FAR more respect for this book if the vamps were hideous in daylight, or if they couldn't go out in daylight at all, but really, sparkly, glittery, diamond like vampires? It's like stuffing every teen girl/woman's fantasies (looks, wealth, diamonds, power, everlasting youth) into a dull boring package. Despite my complaints about the vampires, I do like the characters of Alice and Jasper, Jasper because he seems to actually struggle with his choice to abstain from human blood, and Alice because of her spunky attitude and her mysterious past that was partially reveled in the end (I'd love to read more about Alice)<br /><br />4)  The conflict doesn't kick in until the end. Yes, thanks to Alice, we get a lot of foreshadowing, but even this doesn't come until later. The main conflict w/ the other vamps could have been woven in much earlier into the story.<br /><br />5) The overall writing is blah. First off, 1st person is very, very tough to pull off properly, and, in my opinion, this story would have been much better in a tight 3rd person POV. I think this story suffers from this point of view is because Bella is just plain boring who is ineffectual as a main character. I know she's supposed to be the normal, everyday girl thrown into a wild predicament, but her voice is just plain  boring and at times, snobby and superficial. Another issue I have is the number of times Meyer uses a hyphen to break up a train of thought, which, in the beginning chapters, is very annoying. The characters are all mostly one dimensional, some border 2-D, none are fully fleshed out. Rosalie, one of the vamps, is just described as oh-my-gosh  beautiful and jealous of Bella (*cough cough, Mary Sue alert, cough*), and little else is done with her, indeed, we only hear her speak a couple of measly lines in  the whole book, which is sad because it would be nice to know exactly why she feels about Bella the way she does.  All the human characters besides Bella are 1-D stock characters that the author (and Bella) could care less about. <br /><br />In conclusion, not a great book in my opinion, though I was intrigued by the conflict of Bella wanting to become a vampire. It's such an immature request, but that's why I liked it, because it was a way to remind the readers that Bella, is in fact a child tossed into a relationship with a much older boyfriend, a child who doesn't quite understand what she has gotten herself into or the potential consequences.  The only time I ever liked Edward in this whole book was when he refused her request, despite the benefits to their relationship. A truly selfless act that sadly doesn't excuse the 450+ pages of drivel that came before it. <br /><br />I will read the next book, not only because I'm the type of person that must finish whatever series I begin, not only because I truly want to see what the hype about this series is, but mostly because I hope that the flaws in this first book are remedied later in the series, hope the characters gain more dimensions, hope to learn more about Alice and see Jasper wrestle more w/ abstinence. And while I know Twilight is Meyer's first novel, it just doesn't excuse the excessive faults I found w/ this book. The next "Harry Potter" this is not, and frankly, there are other, far better written YA books out there that deserve more fanfare than what Twilight is getting<br />

very overrated
I admit I was biased before reading this book.  I had noticed that it had gotten a sort of weird cult following and that a lot of people seemed to be strangely obsessed with someone named "Edward Cullen".  Now, I actually thought this Edward Cullen was an actor or somesuch at first, until I finally googled it out of irritation and saw that he was the protaganist to a rather emo-looking book.  I immediately had no interest in reading it.<br /><br />However, my friend convinced me to, saying she loved it, and I did.  I somehow managed to get through it.  All I can say is, what idiot thinks of this book as literature?  Throughout the whole book, I had to chuckle at the heavy-handed and poor writing - I actually checked the author section to see if it was a teenage author (no offense, Stephenie Meyer).  The protaganist is duller than a slab of rock.  Her name is "Bella Swan", a name that sounds like it belongs in a trashy romance novel.  She is constantly falling into damsel in distress positions, whether it be from a car zooming toward her, or four guys following her and apparently attempting to rape her (because she is just that awesome, that she can't walk through a town without guys chasing after her), or some random vampire deciding to fixate on killing her.  Never does she ever use that useful thing called a brain, but acts like an idiot.  She doesn't even endear the reader with some kind of fiery determination. <br /><br />This is what bothered me a good amount as well.  Despite her excessive dullness (the only trait she seems to possess is clumsiness), just about every male in the story falls in love with her.  She is fought over about the spring dance by three different guys; by the end of the story, FIVE different guys crush on her: Mike, Eric, Tyler, Jacob, and Edward.  None of them serve any interest to the plot besides Edward, and to a a small, minute, barely-there extent Jacob.  In fact, the book could easily do without Mike, Eric, OR Tyler. Eric has probably five lines in the whole book: was there ANY purpose in creating him?  It was as though the author's saying: "Look, everyone loves Bella, you should too!"  She's telling us instead of showing us.  How about show us something good about Bella that would make her so fascinating to all these guys?  Couldn't she be clever, or funny, or smart?  She hasn't a drop of any of these things, so I fail to see how she is so amazing to every guy in a five foot radius.  Especially considering there was no purpose to making her so, it was just for the sake of showing off how great Bella supposedly is.<br /><br />Though, come to think of it, there isn't much plot.  I can sum it up fairly quickly: Bella loves Edward.  Edward loves Bella.  But shocker! Edward is a vampire.  But they still go out anyway, even though Bella is stupid and almost dies about a million times. The end.  With such an empty plot, perhaps it would be character-driven, but that too is handled in a piss-poor manner.  The characters are stagnant, despite the love that blossoms magically between them.  No characters are complex or interesting or suspenseful.  They are unbelievably boring.  Even Edward, who has the potential to be an awesome character, sucks.  All that exists in this novel is their love story, and what trash that was: their 'romance' reminded me of the kind of fantasy a twelve-year-old with a vampire fetish would have.  They rarely actually bond - they just spend time together being ungodly boring and WHAM! True love!  She is so in love with him that she actually wants to leave her family, her life, her future, EVERYTHING, to be a vampire.  What a sick, deluded girl.  How is that in any way admirable?  Give up everything for a guy you barely know?  Wow, what a great concept, feed that idea to teen girls everywhere.<br /><br />Perhaps if this premise was used by a more capable author, a better story could come of it.  As it stands, this book is the biggest waste of paper ever.

I am very confused about the popularity of this novel...
I am a young professional, and I have always enjoyed reading various types of literature. When a friend gave me this book and told me about all the great reviews it was receiving, I was very excited to start reading it. After all, I had read and enjoyed many other vampire novels, even though many of them were directed towards a younger age group. After a glance at the back, I felt a little less excited; the storyline and style felt cliché, sappy, and unintelligent. However, it was a gift, so I opened it up and began to read. I could not get through the first page without making faces, but I had hope that it would improve, and maybe I was just being too critical. It never improved.<br />This book was very much like a PG rated romance novel, but if that was the only issue, I could have lived with it it. The dialogue was horrible, and did not allow the reader to get a feel for any character. It just did not seem natural, and none of it was clever. Even when a character was supposed to have made a witty remark, it was never anything remotely witty or clever. Also, I subconsciously picked up way to many repetitions in word choice, and was distracted by them. How many times can a character "saunter" over, or "stare"/"glare". When the novel was descriptive, it was too often over the same things, such as a hair color, or facial reaction. There are many other points I could make about irritating aspects of this novel, so I will move on. <br />Often, after I read a book, I can recall lessons or messages that it taught, or even something small that I learned. That is not the case after reading this book. There was absolutely no purpose to reading it; it was more irritating than entertaining, and had only bad messages. I would not encourage anyone I cared about to read it, as it would an insult to their intelligence. The main character, "Bella", has no ambitions (except to be a vampire and stay with a boy she just met for all eternity?), and she never strives to do anything to better herself or anyone else. It is a selfish mindset she is in, although the author attempts to make her seem like a selfless character. And of course, anyone important in the storyline is described as amazingly beautiful, including the "heroine" (haha) herself, although she apparently does not realize it (once again, completely ridiculous, cliché, and unrealistic). <br />I am sure some people would think I am being unnecessarily harsh, but I really enjoy a book that I can take away something from; a lesson, a message, an interesting fact, anything! I feel like my IQ dropped just from reading this. It is in no way realistic, nobody falls in "true love" that fast, if there even is such a thing. It made me sick, and I am simply trying to spare future readers, and to warn them. There is a lot of fantastic literature out there that you will not be wasting your time to read.

Don't waste your money...
There are SO many things I dislike about this book. One, am I suposed to LIKE these people or something? Um, vampires that sparkle? I think the characters are very poorly developed, and 300+ pages of the book was Bella swooning over Edward and him saving her from everything under the sun. Secondly, if they'd only known each other a few months, isn't it a little weird that they fall madly in love all of a sudden? It would probably take much longer than that! And out main character is supposed to be "soooo smart," yet she acts like a complete idiot. Plus, I couldn't relate to her at all. And the endless descriptions of Edward's perfect eyes, perfect hair, voice, etc. get very tiring throughout the book. I think they used the word "grimace" about 10 thimes in each chapter, that's how irritating it is, and I'm serious! Mostly the whole story is Edward and Bella talking about how much they "love" each other. For some reason, even though Bella faints at the sight of blood, she isn't bothered at all by the fact that partially the reason Edward likes her is because he wants her blood. That really bugged me, too. Don't waste your money. If you want a good vampire book, read Bram Stoker's Dracula...or if you want horror, read The Phantom of the Opera. I like the characters and the storyline much better in that one! But DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON TWILIGHT.

Worst. Book. Ever.
There are times when I feel like I'm at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, shamefully staring down at my feet as I stand and admit truthfully, "Hi, I'm Riley, and I hated Twilight." There are times that I fear for my life as I am forced to admit this fact to another raving fangirl and fellow classmate as they turn from their desk to ask, "Don't you just love Edward Cullen?" I cringe as a look of horrified disgust crosses their face as I state blatantly, "No, actually, I don't." For a fleeting moment, I almost feel as if I should grab my bag and run from the classroom as fast as possible or risk potential martyrdom. I can picture an endless sea of Twilight fans dragging me kicking and screaming to sacrifice me before a shrine they have built in Edward's likeness out of devotion to Stephenie Meyer, the book's author. Let's face it, openly admitting my strong dislike for the novel is practically asking for a death sentence. However, as my journalism grade depends on it, it's a risk I'm willing to take.<br />         The 489-page novel centers on Isabella "Bella" Swan, a seventeen-year-old girl who has recently moved to the rural Forks, Washington with her father, Charlie. At Forks High School, where Bella is usually prized for being the "new girl", she meets the dark and mysterious Edward Cullen, who seems to despise Bella for little to no reason at all. As time passes, the two gradually become attracted to one another, despite Edward's reluctance, and it is later revealed that he is, you guessed it, a vampire. Edward has been trying to avoid Bella because the scent of her blood is strangely and powerfully alluring, and fears he will endanger her. However, like any high school relationship, their love is seemingly too strong to be quenched. The novel continues in a similar vein, filled to bursting with cheesy romance and likewise dramatic plot turns.<br />      Granted, Stephenie Meyer's beloved first book is great for a quick, simple read. The plot is entertaining and easy to become absorbed in, and it rapidly kills time that is begging to be wasted. But the novel is simply that--a time waster, something that should be read once, then never picked up again. Meyer's writing style, while eloquent at times, is somewhat reminiscent of a cheap, drugstore romance novel written by an inexperienced, romance-starved teenage girl. The character of Edward is widely hailed as "gorgeous" and "beautiful" by the fanbase, but this is not, in fact, due to the imagination of the reader. Edward's attractiveness is accepted because Meyer tells us so--about 9,870 times throughout the course of the book (a slight exaggeration, maybe, but a small one at that).  It seems to me that an author of such alleged caliber should harbor the ability to fuel readers' imaginations and make us believe that Edward is as gorgeous and perfect as Bella claims without constantly having to remind us up front.<br />     To me, the characters seemed superficial, lacking any development whatsoever. Edward is a classic example of a stoic character, remaining exactly the same in word and deed throughout the book's entirety. Bella's character is unrealistic, and quite frankly, idiotic at times. Every single conversation in the book can be summed up like this:<br /><br />Edward: Bella, I love you!<br /><br />Bella: [blushes] Despite the fact that you're creepy and watch me while I sleep, which normally would upset any girl who possesses a functioning brain, I love you too!<br /><br />Edward: [said broodingly, with an air of mystery] ...However, our love can never be! I'm far too dangerous!<br /><br />PLENTY OF FILLER LATER<br /><br />Edward: Bella, I love you even though all logic and reasoning tells me to act otherwise!<br /><br />Bella: [says something witty] You are so gorgeous! Let cruel fate never tear us apart!<br /><br />Edward: Well, it's been real and all, but you should probably blow this popsicle stand. I'm dangerous!<br /><br /><br />            The fact that Twilight has inspired many teenage girls and boys alike to begin reading and enjoy doing so is respectable, but beyond that, I don't see the appeal. One can only hope that after devouring Meyer's novels, readers will feel inclined to pick up other books, idealistically ones that were written with the intention to leave the reader with more than they started out with, a feat that Twilight simply could not accomplish.

Glittery vampires? Oh yes.
In a way I feel like the only teenage girl who really disliked this book and isn't head-over-heels for Edward Cullen and his God-like perfection. While I am perfectly aware that this is a YA novel and should be treated as such, even YA deserves some good ol' criticism sometimes. After all, nobody feels bad about ripping apart the Harry Potter books in a review, and they are aimed at an even younger audience. <br /><br />Twilight could very well be the epitome of Mary Sue fiction. It read like something you would find on a fanfiction website and is clear from the very first chapter.<br /><br />Bella Swan, the main character, moves to Forks, Washington, a city that seems to constantly be under siege by rain. She, of course, does not want to be here. She's not fond of her father; she misses her mother, but decides to make a great sacrifice by moving so her mother can travel with her baseball-playing boyfriend while Bella finishes school. From there the author blesses us with lines like: "Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful.", and "It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here?". If you haven't already guessed, Bella's life is terrible because she's shy. However, when she steps foot inside the school, despite her being oh-so depressed, cynical and stricken with a social phobia, she has already made a horde a friends and has boys on her tail, even if she isn't physically appealing. Still in the first chapter, she spots a family of flawless, gorgeous human beings. Here we meet the Cullen family- Edward Cullen in particular. Naturally, she is enchanted by them. Poor Bella finds that, by the power of cliché coincidence, she sits next to said Cullen in Biology. This is where the magic begins.<br /><br />To make a long story short, her life is saved by Edward, she finds out he is a vampire and boom! They're in love. Madly, deeply in love. No suspense and no build-up at all. It just happens. All within the first few chapters. The rest of the book? Lots of smiling, glaring and explanations about Edward's gorgeous eyes, hair, smell and affection. Every time we see him, Bella comments on how his clothes bring out the muscular shape of his body and about his "beautiful crooked smile". Only within the last pages of the book do you get an exciting (which is up to interpretation) story that includes an antagonist. The first 400-some pages were as bland as bland can be.<br /><br />The real fun is with the characters. They have no depth. They're almost laughable.<br /><br />- Bella is beautiful but doesn't believe that she is, despite the fact that she has a vampire and the entire male population of her school drooling over her. Meyer tried to make her a strong heroine, but didn't quite make it. While she may write reports about misogyny in Shakespearean works, she also cooks and cleans for her lazy father who expects nothing less from her and follows Edward's every word religiously with no second thoughts. <br />- Edward is a brooding, angsty vampire with no flaws, perfect hair, beautiful eyes and a body to die for. Enough said. <br />- Edward's family members are cheerful (except for Rosalie. I think she was the only character I liked, because she was snarky and real) and, once again, flawless. <br /><br />I finished the book and came online to see what other people had to say about it only to find that it had a rather large fanbase and tons of perfect reviews. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. Different strokes for different folks as they say. I'm just a bit surprised that it is popular in some of the communities it is popular in- fanfiction writers who scoff at the idea of Mary Sue characters, for example, as if Bella and Edward can be excluded from this.<br /><br />On the positive side, Stephanie Meyer has an interesting perspective on vampires: the fact that they can't sleep and some of the special abilities she gave them that not all vampires have and so on. Then again, she also made them glittery in the sunlight. <br /><br />I've heard there are a lot of grammatical and spelling mistakes in Twilight, but I did not notice them so I can't comment on it. I have poor grammar myself, so it is not as noticeable to me as it is to some people. *shrug*

It's bad, really bad. But is it still for you?
(CAUTION, some spoilers) If this is not the first (negative) review you have read about the book, you know the shortcomings others have mentioned. Let me help to decide if this book is still for you, based on your own personality and preferences:<br /><br />YOU MAY WANT TO READ THIS BOOK IF<br /><br />- No matter how emancipated and self-sufficient you are on the outside, you are really craving a beautiful, strong and dangerous man, who takes away the tedium of making decisions and who loves and protects you irregardless of your mortal flaws.<br /><br />- You really love vampire stories and are looking for ANY new angle or ideas in that genre, no matter how inadequately they are delivered. (Vampires can go out during the day but they glitter in the sun, so they have to stay hidden, vampires are venomous, don't sleep, don't breathe, etc).<br /><br />- You are looking for a teen romance story for you or your teenager that offers a new reason for keeping the relationship platonic. (Vampires could crush the human with their strength if they get too excited).<br /><br />- You are a literature teacher and want a book that illustrates many mistakes of beginning writers all in one convenient package (Mary Sues, telling and not showing, prose that doesn't advance the plot, stilted dialogue, uneven pacing, overly predictable plot twists, bad character development, grammatical errors, etc).<br /><br />- You are a teenager, all your friends rave about this book and you want to have something informed to say. (Read some of the reviews here, that will give you an indication of how controversial the opinions will be - and how to respond to them).<br /><br />YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS BOOK IF<br /><br />- You believe that a relationship between two people is most promising if they are partners with equal rights, responsibilities and the amount of humor, knowledge, sense, affection, etc. they contribute is balanced. (Edward is beautiful, strong, caring, decisive, mature - well, he is about 90 years older. Bella brings her worshiping love - and apparently her fantastic scent).<br /><br />- You want to be able to relate to the protagonists and especially care about the individual who writes in the first person. (Bella is portrayed as an inept, naïve and boring loner.)<br /><br />- Although you like fantasy, you want the plot and the characters to be plausible in their respective context. (Why is Bella so popular in the Forks HS and why does Edward fall for her - the description of Bella doesn't reveal anything special about her other than her bumbling clumsiness and inexperience that keep her in constant need of rescuing. Why would Bella love Edwards family enough to give her life for them, after having known them literally for one day, etc)<br /><br />- You get bored with details that are unimportant for the story or utterly redundant (How Bella gets ready in the morning, how she marinates steaks for dinner, and how perfect, perfect, perfect Edward's face is)<br /><br />- You crave a bit of plausible suspense, unpredictable twists and especially some gripping action. (Bella walks into a dark, villain-infested alley in an unknown city, then she gets rescued by simply driving away with her. During the promising chase of good versus evil in the final chapters, the reader gets to stay with Bella in a hotel room for days, getting news only through a few phone calls or Alice's visions. Then Bella makes some utterly inane decisions that lead to entirely transparent and equally foolish actions. Finally, instead of the showdown with the terrifying fiend, the reader gets to witness the patching up of the silly girl)<br /><br />- You can't excuse un-teenager-like dialogue and you really hate sloppy editing. (The mostly stilted conversations are not justified by overall brilliant prose or stylish writing. On the contrary, the number of grammatical errors in the book teeters between careless and offensive).<br /><br />Well, at least in the case of Twilight, the director will have no trouble making the movie so much better than the book ...

reads like bad, bland slash fiction
I may just sue Ms. Meyer as it is possible that she stole the fabric covered books I wrote my own fantasy novels in when I was 13 - this book is written in the exact same style. The protagonist is a "slender" brunette, apparently so lovely that boys fall over her as soon as she arrives at her new school, including a superior and (as we are continuously told so as to avoid actual description) "godlike" and gorgeous vampire who never bothered with any other girl until he was spellbound at first sight (and evidently, smell). This is not a typical YA novel heroine considering most readers cannot identify or sympathize with someone so amazing and physically attractive. Then I took a look at the author... oh yes, I get it now. We have a term for this and it is MARY SUE. The author has made the main character a thinly veiled perfection of herself and provided absolutely no personality to the character. In fact, every character in this book is barely even a cardboard cut out - no one has any real personality beyond some fleeting stereotypes and everyone behaves predictably and completely unconvincingly. It is like reading "slash" fiction, as Edward only speaks in that way that only exists in slash - males do not act like this in real life, they do not poke you gently on the nose, beg you to tell them ALL about every minute detail of your life and treat you like a newborn baby. Only in slash. Of course this book doesn't even have any sex in it - why? because (as I understand it - remember nothing here makes sense) if he makes love to her he may squash her head like a grape. I'm not making this up people. <br /><br />I adore YA novels but this is livejournal-post quality, not bound published book quality. With that said, it is possible that this may be one of the few instances where the movie might be better than the book. Actors can breathe life into the characters, and the simplistic writing will most likely not show through. Hopefully Edward's tiresome and silly "push me pull you" act will take up no more than a few minutes of screen time. It takes up almost all of this sad little book.

Not what I'd hoped it would be
Bottom line: It could have been so much more than it is, had the author taken the time to portray teens in a realistic light, add depth to the characters and back story, and build credible tension into the plot. Thumbs down, I'm afraid.<br /><br />Comments in bullet form:<br /><br />* Bella's not all that likable. It's hard to invest in the characters, especially in first-person narrative, when you don't really care if they live or die.<br /><br />* Her dialogue is archaic. No teen I've ever known talks that way. She talks of the "scarcity of her funds" in regard to buying a car. Scarcity? Really? <br /><br />* If you're the new kid at school, you get talked ABOUT--not talked TO--a great deal. Unrealistic.<br /><br />* Edward is pretty. He's powerful. And he's dangerous. About half of the book's 500 pages could be axed if the author didn't repeat these three things every five seconds.<br /><br />* Edward doesn't appear to have any depth aside from the fact that he doesn't feed on humans (though he did at one time, apparently). A vampire that doesn't feed on humans? I like this kind better when named Louis. <br /><br />* Sparkly vampires? Nuff said.<br /><br />* Why would you build up a villain and talk about how invincible he is, and then NOT show his defeat? Poor, poor villain. He was robbed!<br /><br />* This book allowed me to get nostalgic for the time in my teens when I discovered Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, rather than endear me to its own characters.<br /><br />* Bella claims that Edward is an unusual, unpopular name. ???<br /><br />* Much of the sentence structure is redundant and distracting.<br /><br />* The back story and mythology is underdeveloped.<br /><br />* Charlie is treated poorly as a character, though his only fault seems to be that he can't get over Bella's mother's departure. Poor man.<br />

Near Nonsense
I wasn't going to review the novel at all because I simply hated it too much and, well, why spend more time dwelling on it than necessary? But the amount of people who claim her writing is flawless, the story is original and perfect, and the book appeals to all ages just drove me crazy. No, her writing is not flawless. In fact, it's very juvenile for someone who has had as much schooling as Stephenie Meyer. The story itself is completely predictable from the drab and ridiculous Preface, to the very last sentence. And the overall plot of the series? Well, I'm not actually sure there is one.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I understand why this book appeals to young readers. It has every girl's fantasy, doesn't it? A handsome boy falling madly in love with the supposedly plain new girl. The story is so simplistic and so centered on this love story that, frankly, it can become addicting whether you like what you are reading or not (and I will freely admit to reading it in about six hours). I would not shy away from giving this book to preteen friends of mine.<br /><br />However, I think the bias has to end somewhere. This book makes Harry Potter a literary masterpiece. This book makes Anne Rice's novels appear well-constructed. This book does not do anything new for the genre--which is not wrong. No one needs to set out and create a new precedent. No one is under that obligation. That doesn't negate the fact that the entire story was very tired. I had no interest in Bella's questions. I had no interest in the long blocks of explanations. There is a good reason Jo Rowling left most of her explanations scattered through seven books of varying length, and not all at once in every chapter. For someone who is hanging on the fence, boring descriptions and Q&A sessions are a killer.<br /><br />Additionally, and perhaps the real reason I disliked the book, Bella Swan made for one of the worst protagonists I've ever read. Reading Meyer's website, I was amazed that someone who loves her characters so dearly manages to create such lifeless, flat personifications of them on paper. Bella is your typical self-insert of the author. She shares the author's hometown. She has a beautiful name--Isabella Swan! She's so clumsy that you figure she probably has an inner ear problem. She's constantly miserable, irritatingly oblivious to the world she's describing to us, and overdramatic.<br /><br />And none of these are endearing traits.<br /><br />Handled differently, they could be. Handled differently, they would be. Third person would have been preferable, rather than first. In a romance story where the author is not quite sophisticated enough to actually provide realism instead of fanfiction, first person kills the narrative. One moment, Bella is weeping over how horrible her life is. The next moment, she's discussing how unattractive she is while rebuffing three invitations to the dance in one day--after having no relationships at home. These are not endearing. These are the hopes and wishes of very young teenage girls, and perhaps a few older ones. But it makes for a very ridiculous read through. Personally, I believe Meyer should have worked on reading a bit more structured works before sitting down. She ought to have researched fiction writing and the dynamics of creating a proper heroine, because she has managed to make someone that is very unrealistic to the point of frustration.<br /><br />You see, it's frustrating because I know Meyer is trying to make Bella realistic instead of perfect. What girl doesn't think she's ugly sometimes? What girl doesn't stumble gracelessly over her own feet? The only difference is, in a novel, these traits are the superficial flaws of a Mary Sue. Simply, they aren't flaws at all. They are excuses to make Bella "less perfect" while achieving the exact opposite. Had Bella been genuinely shy (she so wasn't shy!), genuinely unhappy, genuinely boring, it might have been less irritating. But she was clearly outgoing. She was clearly beautiful. She stumbled into horrible situations only to be saved by a gaggle of boys. And all the while, she remained oblivious to all of it. That isn't a flaw--that's convenience. And it's very immature writing.<br /><br />I also think all of the Prefaces should have been removed. Upon reading Twilight's, I burst out laughing. Coming forward to kill her, eh? The writing couldn't handle the suspense or drama the author was attempting to create--it left no room for either. This is where first person kills the narrative completely. This preface then set the tone for the entire book, and I laughed similarly at about half of the descriptions she used.<br /><br />There is no need to reiterate that Edward is perfect. If you trust your reader, you should trust them to remember that Edward is, apparently, a Greek god or adonis with an angel's face and runway model physique with black eyes sometimes, topaz eyes sometimes, ocher eyes sometimes, and golden hair, and that he drives fast, has a lot of money, is a musical savant, sparkles in the sun, dresses impeccably, etc., etc. You only need to say someone is perfect a couple of times over the course of the novel for anyone to understand.<br /><br />All the overdesigning of Edward's appearance ended up feeling like was the author relishing in this personal fantasy. And that's great. We all have personal fantasies! But this book doesn't quite deserve the enormous praise it's receiving from all corners. Dissect the writing. Look at the ridiculous romance novelesque style of it all. Don't tell me writing doesn't matter when it's Young Adult. The YA genre is expanding. Teenagers are writing exquisite pieces of literature and not publishing them anywhere. There is no excuse for poor writing.<br /><br />If I wanted to read a romance novel, I would have picked one up. At least romance novels have plot. Meyer all-too-frequently used 'scowling' and 'glaring' as the only method of communication between people. And Edward's behavior was indecisive to the point insanity. His constant 'please go away I can't love you I'll kill you but don't go away I love you please go away' would drive any sane human being into a psychological tailspin. If you made the movie exactly how she wrote the book, Bella and Edward would be consistently scowling at one another and arguing over everything. And there would be no plot until the last fifteen minutes. <br /><br />Because, frankly, there was no plot. After the lust between Edward and Bella was reconciled, my interest left completely. After the relationship became whole, I was done. Everything else Meyer threw in seemed very, very half-hearted. And that's a shame, because I know she dedicated as many years into her characters. I only wish her results were better.<br /><br />May your writing improve in the future, Stephenie Meyer. You have serious potential, but you probably jumped on writing and publishing these novels too soon. You definitely needed more time in Washington, as well.

Much ado about nothing
The only people on earth who are allowed to sparkle are as follows...<br /><br />1) Drag Queens. A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug.<br /><br />2) David Bowie. Need I say more?<br /><br />Someone needs to explain the why's and wherefore's of this whole "sparkly vampire" business to me. I really don't understand it at all. Going out in daylight... OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles?<br /><br />Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroghly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick)<br /><br />As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren't any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn't any drama. This is a vampire movie with no caonflict among the main characters. Only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing's really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn't have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment "the new girl." <br /><br />Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella's sheriff dad and the "maulings" (read: vampire attacks) he's investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward's wangsting.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There's one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn't paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I'm sorry, but that's just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don't care if the poor guy is a bit character, I'd rather a small look at any if the bit characters' small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film.<br /><br />Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the "OMG bad vampires." I'll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I'm told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them.<br /><br />As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villain's aren't developed at all. They are clearly "OMG EVOL!!!1!!" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn't terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend Twilight to anyone. No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper.

Is this what love is supposed to be?
This is one of the most frightening displays of romance I've ever seen in my life.  This is NOT a love story.  Edward (male protagonist)is obsessive to the point of restraining order.  He watches her sleep, follows her everywhere and is only interested because this is the one persons mind he cannot read.  Bella (female protagonist) is about intriguing as a candy bar wrapper (an empty one at that).  <br /><br />Since I've read the books (occupational hazards of a librarian) I know this only gets worse.  In a world of quality young adult literature where relationships are often shown as fleeting and impermanent, this story should not have been published let alone made into a movie.<br /><br />After reading/viewing anything I have to ask: what's the point? In this instance I cannot come up with anything.  What is this book/movie trying to say about relationships?  Because this is scary, obsessed love, not fulfilling, lasting love.<br /><br />P.S. Why do recent authors think they have personal license to change vampire lore?

Atrocious in a thoroughly enjoyable way
I can't recall the last time I had this much FUN with a poorly-made movie. I honestly can't decide whether I want to give it 'one star' for how genuinely terrible it is, or 'five stars' for how enjoyable it was to be appalled by.<br /><br />It's a sort of tradition amongst my local friends and I to rent movies we fully expect to be bad and watch them together; often we're just bored and, by the time the ending credits roll, feeling that we just lost two hours of our lives that we shall never get back. This one, though, stands out as one of the greats. <br /><br />If you're new to the series, the premises is this: Bella Swan (yes, 'beautiful swan') moves from her arid Phoenix home to Forks, Washington, where she meets and falls in love with a dour and seemingly perpetually-nauseated boy named Edward Cullen. She soon discovers his secret - that he's a vampire! - by Googling "cold ones," a term she finds in a book of Native American mythology. One would expect that Googling this term would actually yield many pages pertaining to beer. Or maybe that's just me. Anyway, a very clingy and angst-ridden relationship ensues, and after playing baseball in a thunderstorm with Edward's family, Bella meets a nasty vampire named James, who immediately develops his own obsession with her.<br /><br />Unlike Edward, though, James wants to eat Bella. Really badly.<br /><br />Most of this takes place in the latter half of the movie. The first half is comprised mostly of Bella moping around her new town and exchanging silent stares with Edward.<br /><br />Ah, Edward.<br /><br />It gave me pleasure to discover exactly how much the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, despises Edward Cullun.<br /><br />"When I read it I was convinced Stephenie was convinced she was Bella and it was like it was a book that wasn't supposed to be published. It was like reading her sexual fantasy, especially when she said it was based on a dream and it was like, 'Oh I've had this dream about this really sexy guy,' and she just writes this book about it. Like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced, like, 'This woman is mad. She's completely mad and she's in love with her own fictional creation.' And sometimes you would feel uncomfortable reading this thing..." "...the more I read the script, the more I hated this guy."<br /><br />Edward Cullen has a completely inconsistent personality, and Pattinson solved this by playing him as, in his own words, "as a manic-depressive who hates himself."<br /><br />Now, I understand some preteen girls actually find Edward's various advances upon Bella to be romantic - like admitting to sneaking into her room to watch her sleep for months before he even made an attempt to be nice to her. I'm led to wonder how some fathers would feel if they knew their young daughters admired such qualities in future boyfriends. Personally I think Edward is downright creepy, but as Pattinson apparently meant to portray him this way, kudos to Mr. Pattinson!<br /><br />For Bella's part, she's an unabashed Mary Sue, with every male in town falling all over himself to befriend, date, or, in one scene, gang rape her. It's Edward, however, who wins her inexplicable devotion, mainly by following her around and saying things like, "We shouldn't be friends," or, "Stay away from me!" in a low menacing voice. <br /><br />By the end of the movie, after lots of heaving and sighing and rushed special-effects, we're meant to believe that the two are star-crossed lovers, though they seem more like an abusive relationship in the making. With the vampire James dispatched, Edward and Bella slaver over each other's necks at prom, and James' female companion Victoria slinks away in the backdrop, doubtlessly plotting mischief.<br /><br />There's also a sub-plot straight from the underwhelming "Underworld" series regarding a rivalry between werewolves and vampires, but it's barely touched on in this installment. <br /><br />I wonder, given his public slandering of the franchise, whether Mr. Pattinson will reprise his role as Edward in the next film. A part of me is looking forward to it.

The Few Strong Points Are Swallowed by the Overwhelming Campy Badness
I consider myself a Twilight fan. I love the books and since reading the first one have bought the other three the day they came out. I was extremely excited about the movie, and went to see it opening night. My first thought by the halfway point of the movie was: WHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS?!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Twilight: The Movie is a horrible, campy, tacky, CHEAP vampire story that swallows almost all of the power of the novels. The vampire special effects are even WORSE than "Queen of the Damned" (which is hard to achieve), and the "action" scenes were scripted, confusing, and in some cases pointless and lame.<br /><br />The acting was off and it was awful. Kristin Stewart was weak and ineffectual as Bella. She portrays none of Bella's strengths and instead presents her as, essentially, a weakling, a coward and a whiner. Rob Pattinson's Edward is kind of creepy, kind of tacky, and completely unromantic; in fact, he's kind of off-putting. None of the Cullens act like they're supposed to except Rosalie and Alice, so of course they only got about five lines each in the entire movie.<br /><br />The worst acting choice was whoever played Charlie -- he's a dead fish in the entire movie. He never displays ANY emotion. Now, in the books Charlie IS kind of closed-off, but he DOES get upset -- like when Bella says she's running away, for instance. In the movie, he's quiet and unmoved and seems to say nothing but "Oh, my daughter's running away. Don't go, Bella. Please stay, Bella. Wonder what's on TV?"<br /><br />However, first and foremost, the love story element was RUINED by the script. Bella and Edward are awkward as can be together, and at one point Edward makes the cryptic comment "It would be better for you if we weren't friends." Now, at this point in the movie, he's been nothing but a supreme jerk to Bella at every turn. If I were Bella, my response would have been: 'What?! We AREN'T friends! You're a creeper and you need to go before I call the cops! Stranger danger! [Makes sign of the cross]'<br /><br />By the time they're 'together' as a couple it feels so rushed and unnatural that you have to gag at some of Bella's more romantic thoughts, which make perfect sense in the book. One of the worst mistakes they made was combining about five different important scenes and shortening them into one confusing scene: the meadow scene, combined with the first running scene, combined with the skipping class scene, combined with three other minor scenes. It was rushed, confusing, creepy, unromantic, weird, badly acted, badly shot, and badly directed.<br /><br />The dynamic of Bella and Edward was ruined -- Edward is supposed to be so supremely larger than life to Bella; for instance, in the book when he runs (he's supposed to look like a blur, which the movie of course killed off right away) with Bella the first time she's violently ill and can't stand for a moment. In the movie she just hops off his back as if to say 'Alright, I do this all the time.'<br /><br />In the book, James, the villain, is actually rather terrifying. In the movie...okay, the actor is admittedly very attractive. But -- have you ever seen the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (NOT the show, because the show was amazing; the movie was awful)? You know, where Rutger Hauer played the most CAMPY, RIDICULOUS vampire EVER? Well, James almost TOPS his performance in "Buffy" -- again, VERY hard to achieve.<br /><br />Another point of unintended comedy? Bella and Edward spend half the friggin' movie in a TREE. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. He calls her "spider monkey," for the love of GOD. It's SILLY! And then when the Cullens jump at the 'bad vampires'? It looks like they're about to perform the song and dance "fight" in the first scene of "West Side Story!" How utterly absurd!<br /><br />The casting was awful, the acting was awful, the script was awful, the special effects were AWFUL. Possibly the only good points about this movie was the first five minutes, which actually did a very good job for some strange reason, and the last five minutes, which also did a very good job, for some strange reason. Every other minute of the movie was excruciating in its mediocrity.<br /><br />I pray to God every day that people don't watch this D-Grade piece of CRAP movie and go away thinking to themselves, "Well, now I KNOW I'll never read 'Twilight' after watching THAT crap."

Twilight of the Vampire Romance
I have to believe Twilight was the most talked-about film of 2008 in the science-fiction/fantasy community. When it hit DVD, I was anxious to see it. An hour into the film, however, I was fighting the urge to turn it off and toss the disc into the trash. How is it that this unoriginal, glacially-paced, staggeringly emotionless film has such a large fan following? I can only presume that because I'm not a young girl keeping a weepy self-indulgent diary, and therefore fall outside of the target demographic, I just don't "get it."<br /><br />My wife has read all the books five times, and was even more anxious than I to see the film, but she literally walked out of the room halfway through, never to see the end, complaining that the film version had "ruined" every single aspect of the books (though these ideas are so threadbare, I personally don't even see how the books could have been better). Naturally, a movie has to change things  --  it's a different medium from literature - but my wife assures me that the changes were arbitrary and ruinous. She also assured me that the main male character, who we both thought was terrible, was not coming across as the super-mega-hunk everyone says he is. So it's not just because I'm a guy that I thought he was flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />It's a plot point that there's little sunlight in this film, but after an hour of watching this overly blue-toned movie, you just start feeling ill. There are no flesh tones; everyone is blue and sickly-looking. It starts to wear on you. The main character looks like they magic-marker'd his eyebrows in.<br /><br />As to the plot... what plot? Listen, folks... vampire romances have been done to absolute death by now. Everything in this film, we have seen before, either through Near Dark, Forever Knight, Anne Rice novels, or even Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The brooding James-Deanish vampire love interest has passed deeply into cliché (Angel did it better, but I even thought it was getting old ten years ago). About the only thing "new" here is the idea that vampires actually look "beautiful" in their true appearance, yet on my big flat screen, what the main female character was oohing & ahhing about looked more like slimy snakeskin than diamonds, so even at THAT level, I was out of sync.<br /><br />Anyone buying or renting this film has SOME idea of what it's about, even if just from the movie poster. And yet it takes the film a full hour to get us there. We've seen this and seen it... you can hurry along to the big "reveal" and get the actual PLOT moving, please. But even when it starts to move... well... we've seen that too!<br /><br />I really do not understand what magic this film holds for people, but if you haven't seen this yet, you too are probably not among its target audience. So save yourself and give Twilight a pass. It's a tired old derivative idea presented in a stunningly boring package, with a whole cast of young, unlikeable, blue-skinned people.<br />

Sorely disappointed...
While I am not among the core demographic that this movie was targeted for, I am an enormous fan of the Twilight books. So I was more than thrilled to learn that a movie was being adapted out of them. Always one of the mind that "book is always better than the movie," I didn't have huge expectations given the budget and director. Even my lowered expectations were not prepared for the monstrocity that appeared on the screen. For 120 minutes, I watched a wooden cast run through the motions of the script. Kristen Stewart could not have been worse. Bella is a warm and charmingly clumsy young woman. Although in the books, she appears aloof at times, she loves fiercely and with all her heart. Ms. Stewart never even came close to any of those emotions except the aloofness. Her stilted portrayal of Bella was heart-breaking to watch. Even when she was being tortured by James, she barely managed a facial expression.<br /><br />Robert Patterson was a "passable" Edward. He maintains Edward's stoic and agonized behavior after meeting Bella. However, Edward of the novels is a larger-than-life presence with a restrained passion that is always teetering on the brink. Patterson falls short in his portrayal, leaving the viewer with a feeling that Edward is really nothing but a jerk. And the chemistry between Patterson and Stewart is...wait, there was none. I got the impression that they didn't even LIKE each other a majority of the time.<br /><br />As for the other actors, they were fairly true to the novel. Carlisle and Esme gave decent performances as loving and doting "parents." Rosalie's snide and pretentious behavior was right on the mark; Alice's sweetness, Jasper's restraint, even Emmett's teddy bear/jackal persona were all very believable. BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN THE MOVIE FOR TEN MINUTES TOTAL!!!<br /><br />Another disappointment was the holes that the movie left in the story. One of the key pieces in the first novel was the desire the high school boys felt for Bella. In hindsight I understand why the director chose to leave most of it out. NO ONE would believe that these boys would hone in on Ms. Stewart's lethargic and non-effectual Bella. On the plus side, the scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was pretty decent. I can only hope that with the change of director, and the fact that the studio has seen how popular the movies COULD be, they increase the budget and buy a new CGI team and get their lead actors some ACTING lessons. <br /><br />Finally, a note to Stephanie Meyer. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT allow Hollywood to continue to destroy the wonderful world you created.

Horrible
This movie is just plain silly.  Vampires hanging out in high school hitting on less than legal teenage girls?  The vampires all tried to dress semi cool/edgy see also as(homosexually.)  It's a trashy plotless, rehashed love novel with vampires of questionable sexual orientation.  If you like this crap you need to probably get out of the house more often.

A Waste of paper
Now, before people jump down my throat about this review and start claiming that I don't know what I'm taking about, I feel I must say that I have read all the Twilight books, and I believe the title of this post says it all. I strongly discourage anyone who wishes to retain a decent number of brain cells from reading this atrocious series. Stephenie Meyer, as Stephen King said, "cannot write worth a darn," and her "vampires" are, quite frankly, wimps. The relationship between Edward Cullen, (a "vampire"), and Isabella Swan, is preposterous, and based mainly on the fact that Edward is pretty and Bella smells good. Neither of those, in my opinion, is a good idea to be with someone.<br /><br />*Possible spoilers beyond this point...Not that there's really anything to spoil; even if you only read the first chapter, it's all pretty obvious what's going to happen in the next 2505 pages of the series*<br /><br />The plot of the first Twilight book is as lifeless as Bella's personality. For 7/8 of the book, Edward and Bella struggle with their forbidden relationship. Example:<br /><br />Bella: Edward, I love you.<br />Edward: I know, but we can't be together. I am just too dangerous.<br />Bella: I don't care!<br />Edward: I know what is best for you, Bella. You can never see me again.<br />*A day goes by, during which Bella mopes around, and the next morning, Edward is in her driveway with his Volvo*<br />Edward: I've come to take you to school, Bella.<br />Bella: Edward, I love you.<br />(etcetera etcetera...)<br /><br />Oh. My. God.<br /><br />This, as you can imagine, begins to get very, very boring after a while, but then, lone behold, there is a small gleam of hope for some sort of pick-up when a "Tracker vampire" named James decides he wants to kill Bella. Well, I personally think he'd better get in line since Edward saw her first, but whatever. Eventually, after running from Forks, Washington to Phoenix, Arizona, Bella is lured to a ballet studio by James and a home video, and nearly killed. Not quite as exciting as you may think, especially since Edward and the gang arrive in time to save her and kill James. Bella, though she is bitten, is kept from becoming a "vampire" thanks to some quick thinking from Edward.<br /><br />Yeah, because if Edward let Bella become a "vampire", then their lives would just be soooo perfect, and Stephenie Meyer wouldn't have been able to torture the world with more of her stupid ideas. <br /><br />I'm getting rude now, and I apologize; I'll tone it down. <br /><br />In New Moon, Edward does finally leave Bella because another "vampire" named Jasper tries to eat her, and she sits in the woods for almost a day. Just sits there. Because, as we all know, a girl without a guy simply cannot function. Mhm, sure. That isn't archaic or anything. So, after Bella sits in the woods until her father and some other guys find her and drag her home, she is basically catatonic for months. Really. In the book, you turn the page, and it says FEBRUARY, then the next page says MARCH, then APRIL, and so on and so forth. I don't remember what finally snaps her out of this funk, but by that time, Bella has begun to hear Edward's voice. In her mind.<br /><br />Yeah, she's not going insane or anything.<br /><br />Oh, and since this only happens when she's in life-threatening situations, Bella sets out to do all this dangerous stuff, including jumping off of a cliff, just so she can hear Edward's voice in her head. I guess the fact that she might die did not occur to her. Meanwhile, Jacob, (an indian boy who was also in the first book), is being led on by Bella, who is bored and wants him to rebuild her a motorcycle for free, because he, like everyone else in the world of Twilight, cannot get enough of her, in spite of the fact that she is very plain and lacks any sort of personality.<br /><br />(By the way, I don't think that Stephenie Meyer has ever been on an indian reservation in her life, because she seems to have no idea what the Hell she's talking about. Then again, that applies to most everything she writes, so maybe it's just her style is to be ignorant.)<br /><br />So, while Bella is stringing Jacob along, she is attacked by the late James' "vampire" mate, Victoria, and Jacob turns into a werewolf and saves her. Sure, okay. Bella, not the sharpest tool in the shed, thinks that Jacob's wolf-form is actually a bear for a while. Nice. <br /><br />Anyway, as all of this is happening in Washington, Edward is in Italy planning to kill himself. Why? Well, through a series of miscommunications, he heard that Bella committed suicide, so, naturally, he must die as well. Bella and another "vampire" Alice go to stop him. They arrive JUST IN TIME, and then escape back to Forks, but not before a group of "vampire" royalty tells Edward that Bella has to be turned into a "vampire" or killed because she knows about "vampires". To Edward's dismay, it is decided that Bella will be changed when she graduates high school. Bella 1, Edward 0.<br /><br />The next book...what is it called again? *checks wikipedia* Oh yeah, Eclipse. So, in Eclipse, Bella is still being hunted by the "vampire" Victoria. Edward, who had since returned to Bella and Forks, is being especially obnoxious, because now he's jealous over Bella's relationship with Jacob. He forbids her to see him, but, for the first time ever, Bella decides to disobey Edward, and begins visiting Jacob on a regular basis. This makes Edward even more jealous, so he decides that he must marry Bella and take her off the market.<br /><br />Edward didn't count on Bella being super against marriage.<br /><br />In spite of this, when Edward proposes, Bella accepts. Practically the next day, Edward and his family decide to join forces with Jacob and his pack to fight off Victoria and her band of newly-turned "vampires". Bella is taken up a mountain, and watched over by both Jacob and Edward during the fight. When Jacob hears of Edward and Bella's engagement, he threatens to rush off and get himself killed. Bella, in her infinite wisdom, kisses Jacob, and realized that she loves him too. <br /><br />Thus, the love triangle.<br /><br />Victoria manages to find Edward in the mountains, and, after a brief fight, she is destroyed. Bella is still trying to convince both herself and Jacob that she loves Edward more, but after Edward gives Jacob and invitation to the wedding, Jacob, all hot and flustered that Bella's going to become a "vampire" runs off into the woods. <br /><br />Real manly there, Jacob.<br /><br />Last, and definitely least, Breaking Dawn. If all the books up to this point have been bad, this one is truly and without question the most god-awful of them all. <br /><br />Bella is brain-dead. She wants Edward to do her BEFORE she is turned into a "vampire". He argues, but they eventually have sex, and, OF COURSE, Bella gets knocked up. Friggin' fantastic story-writing here, Meyer. A few days after Bella and Edward go at it, (during which they have sex a few more times), Bella begins to feel her stomach kicking. I believe it to be much more likely that she has a bunch of snakes inside of her than a child, since that was way too quick, but it did turn out to be a kid.<br /><br />Break out the cigars.<br /><br />Edward, who is apparently not a big smoker, freaks out and wants to abort the child, with or without Bella's consent, but Bella refuses and he actually listens to her. Why does she refuse? Because she's stupid. Over the next few days, she swells like a toad, and enlists the help of a vampire named Rosalie to keep Edward from doing anything rash. Rosalie, who had always wanted children, agrees to help Bella out. Personally, I also think Rosalie hoped Bella would die, and my condolences go out to her that this dream was not realized.<br /><br />Bella begins craving blood, and she drinks some human stuff that the "vampires" had on ice from a sippy cup. Meanwhile, Jacob's pack wants to kill Bella and the kid, but then Bella gives birth. Most of her bones are broken, and she loses a bunch of blood, but then, at long last, Edward turns Bella into a "vampire". Happy friggin' day.<br /><br />Oh, and Jacob imprints on the kid. Imprinting=immediately falling in love forever. I really wanted Jacob to imprint on Edward, but I suppose you can't always get what you want. <br /><br />Now that Jacob has found his soul-mate in the form of Bella's newborn daughter, named, (can you believe it?), Renesmee, Bella has to get used to being a "vampire". As she was uber-clumsy in life, I thought that that was the trait Bella should have taken to death, but no. Instead, she is unnaturally in control of her "vampiric" instincts. <br /><br />Ug. <br /><br />The rest of this book is just unbearable. Renesmee is thought to be an "immortal child", which is apparently bad, so all these bad "vampires" come to kill her and Bella and all the other good "vampires" called the Cullens. Another kid like Renesmee is found, and he tells the bad "vampires" that Renesmee is not an "immortal child", but is a crossbreed like him, and poses no threat. The bad "vampires" leave, and then Bella and Edward, and I quote, "continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of [their] forever."<br /><br />Holy two-pound bag of sugar, Batman.<br /><br />So, now that I have taken time to write this out, I hope beyond hope that I can convince just a few readers that this series is a complete waste of time and paper. For the love of God, people, the "vampires" SPARKLE. Don't tell me that's not one of the lamest things you've ever heard. And they don't have fangs! Didn't catch that? Hold on, I'll say it again. THE "VAMPIRES" DON'T HAVE FANGS!!! I am so freaking sick of all the Twilight paraphernalia, (which, by the way, is EVERYWHERE), with fangs on it. Bella clearly says so when Jacob asks if it the fangs hurt when she kisses Edward.<br /><br />In closing, I must say that these are all fictional characters. Edward is not real. Hear me fangirls? NOT REAL. Move on with your lives.<br /><br />The End<br /><br />P.S. Save trees; burn Twilight books.

Missed the Mark for Me
After all the hype, and a cost effective opportunity to experience this series, I jumped at it. After all, I have a fondness for the paranormal books that have popped up, everything from Poppy Z Brite to the Black Dagger books, Southern Vampire books, Immortals After Dark, Sunshine, et al. I wanted some light reading, wasn't looking necessarily for deep themes, or really much beyond entertainment. <br /><br />I did watch the movie prior to starting the books, which I rarely do, but felt that hopefully some of the elements that I was dissatisfied with in the film Twilight would be rectified in the books. Sadly, after reading all four in a marathon session, I find that those elements that I was unhappy with seem to have originated with the source material. There are a plethora of detailed, complex reviews from other who were dissatisfied for various reasons, as as from people who have been quite satisfied. For myself, probably the most egregious part was the utter lack of character that I got from Bella. I don't know this girl, despite dragging myself through 3 years of her life, in mostly first person, and I have no sympathy, nor empathy for her. She felt like a placeholder, very poorly fleshed out. There were hints of things: talking about feeling out of place in the world, her unhappiness with everything, but that was the extent. It's as if while reading I kept trying to strike a tuning fork and only got clanks, no resonance.<br /><br />Somewhere after Twilight with genuine interest I simply slogged through the text, hoping against hope that the task I had set for myself would end at some point. It was an exercise in control by the end of the first part of Breaking Dawn, as I became devoid of interest. The comparison has been made to fanfiction, and I cannot disagree, particularly as the "special powers," creepy progeny and minimal conflict evolved. Yes, I also agree with the "Mary Sue" references that have been bandied about.<br /><br />I will say, maybe I missed the point, maybe my tastes have been changed or jaded by my other reading, but in good conscience, I don't feel comfortable recommending these books to the tween-teenage audience that they seem to be marketed to. There are a plethora of books that have compelling characters, interesting plots, aspects of the paranormal, and remain age appropriate. Diana Wynn Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip are authors I still have on my shelves, and still reread. I cannot say the same about what I have seen thus far from Ms. Meyer.

Overrated
Purple prose, writing that tells and doesn't show, shallow plot and characterizations, Mary Sue protagonist, sloppy research.  These books read like bad fanfiction written by a hyperventilating 13-year-old.    <br /><br />Bella and Edward share a sick obsession, not love.  They are not role models, nor should any young person aspire to a relationship like theirs. Spare me the Romeo and Juliet comparisons.  Shakespeare did not write R & J to be the "greatest love story ever," he wrote it to demonstrate how stupid people can be when the heart completely rules the head.  Nobody's life should be so wrapped up in another person that being without that person makes you a zombie with a death wish when they leave.  Nobody should be "unconditionally and irrevocably" in love with another person, especially if that person turns out to be an abusive dirtbag, as Eddie Sparklepants demonstrates numerous times throughout the four books.<br /><br />Yes, I read them all.  I kept hoping something would happen, that somebody would develop beyond the one dimension the author gave them at first; I hoped for redemption.  There was none.  Gotta hand it to Meyer for keeping the shallow going for 2,500 pages, with a forced happy ending all tied up in a shiny bow.  Disney has nothing on Meyer's sparkly perfect immortals.  <br /><br />I can't believe how many embarrassingly old fans there are. Grown women should know better and should use these books as examples when cautioning their daughters about unhealthy relationships.<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer is another Dan Brown--a writer with interesting story ideas that completely fall apart in their execution.  <br /><br />I'm glad I didn't buy the books; I would have been furious at myself for the waste of money as well as time.

As a book overrated, too much hype...
I've read this after I watched the film and this would probably be the first time in my life that I would actually strongly recommend that you watch the film first before reading these books. The film would set a nice scene for you to fall into if you like... <br /><br />If it wasn't for the film with two very easy on the eye leads in the shape of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, I really don't know how I would cope with these books. I only bought them to find out what happens next. If this wasn't the driving force behind my purchase and I somehow stumbled upon these books before the film, I have to say they would be abandoned mid-way through the first book. <br /><br />The idea is great but it's never developed properly by the author. Her characterisation is pathetically weak and you will never get to find out anything about Edward, Bella, Jacob or anyone else apart from the fact that they are all beautiful and she wants both of them in her life while keeping the rest of the population as far out of it as possible. <br /><br />The writing is so bad that the author struggles to describe the main characters beyond phrases like "he was marble white, his skin was ice cold, he was beautiful Adonis-like, perfect" and the actions never go beyond, "he glared at me and growled". And this is literally in every chapter of every book. <br /><br />The first book is full of, "I love you, you love me, we love each other and it's all going to last forever" and this is probably where the author should have ended it instead of going on and on, and on for another 3 very thick books where she repeats the same thing in the same way over and over again. The books are pretty thick, well over 500-600 pages each, so that is a lot of glaring and growling from the sparkling Adonis. <br /><br />By book 3, you still have no idea what is the driving force behind their love apart from the fact that Edward is beautiful and Bella smells nice. And I do accept the fact that love is unconditional and cannot be any other way. However, fictional books are for entertainment and we all would like something more from them, which this never gives. <br /><br />Book 4 should never have been written. In fact, book 3 was already overdoing it. I don't know if the author was paid to stretch it as much as possible but, whatever the reason, she has completely killed what could have been a perfectly nice story. And my gripe isn't with the fact that it lacks even the most basic vampire logic. I actually really don't mind how closely it does or doesn't follow what vampires and werewolves should be doing. In fact, I completely accept this as a love story only but even as that alone, it's so weak and pathetic that I really struggle to understand how she managed to write 4 volumes! The quality of writing makes Mills and Boon novels look like they are worthy of the Booker Prize!<br /><br />I can see how certain type of teenage girls and certain type of adults may be crazy about these books but if you are not one of those, I would generally recommend that you don't waste your time and money on this and watch the films as they come out. You won't miss anything. Mr Pattinson and Miss Stewart will continue being easy on the eye, the soundtrack to the first one was gorgeous, what more do you need for a Hollywood love story? With some luck, the remaining films will live up to the expectation. Don't bother looking for something more in the books because there isn't anything there. At least in the film, even when Edward growles and glares repetitively, it doesn't look so odd. <br /><br />

What a shame...
As other reviewers have mentioned, the second two books in this series do not compare to the first. I feel obligated to write a review, because I feel as if I wasted my money on them, and would like to warn others away. Read the first book, Twilight, only! It is very unique and I enjoyed it very much, even though I am not what you would call a vampire-are-hot-romance novel reader.<br />Sadly, things slowly went downhill after Twilight. But I hardly noticed this after I read New Moon. I was still happy with the series. It wasn't until Eclipse that I realized what happened. ALL the characters, it seems like, are immature. Especially annoying to me is Bella's dad. I would expect the adults, at least, to act like adults. And why is Bella constantly cooking?!? (Although at every mention of this, I usually love it, because it makes me laugh.) It seems to me that the author decided to try to push her beliefs on her readers. If you are a teenager, you should not have sex until you are married, go to school and get straight A's, and cook for your irresponsible parents. Oh, and if the love of your life treats you badly, you should become severely depressed and become an automaton. God forbid the main character show she has a backbone (like she did in the first book).<br />This is such a shame... And there was so much potential here for a great story! The werewolf-vampire thing could have been the best part of the story... and if only SM had kept the friendship of Bella and Jake as a friendship! Imagine the tension if he really was her best friend and just wanted to look out for her. Enough of this love nonsense. Bella really is a nothing character, she doesn't even have the spunk she had in the first book.<br />Oh well. I am an optimist, so I will look into the 4th installment of this series, but I will definitely not buy it unless I hear that Bella has grown up. Unfortunately, I suspect that the series is beyond saving.

vampires, werewolves, and helpless females
To preface this, I'll say up front that I loathe love triangles.  They're trite plot devices that are very rarely executed well, and that's just one of the huge problems with Eclipse.  It's a love triangle that, according to the author, was designed for Bella to make a choice.  Really?  Was there any shred of doubt over what option she was going to go with?<br /><br />Unfortunately for Eclipse, about three quarters of the book involved pitting Edward and Jacob against each other in a quarrel over who Bella loves more (and again, really?).  Sure, it's great to be loved, but in this instance it just makes everyone look bad.  Jacob comes off as too sexually forceful, Edward looks like a lump on a log reciting the same "if it's good for Bella, it's good for me" line, and Bella looks more selfish and whiny than usual.  Sure, Bella was whiny and annoying way before Eclipse, but she puts on a grand display here and it makes one long for a point of view change.  Anyone.  Jessica's point of view would probably be preferable. <br /><br />The rest of the book is about some killings in Seattle that, of course, mean Bella is in danger, which, naturally, means Edward has to act like a psycho boyfriend intent on saving her from herself.  Early on he attempts to keep her house bound by ripping the spark plug out of her car, and while I thought that was a little melodramatic and creepy he one ups himself constantly after that.  No wonder Bella kept grumbling and sighing whenever he kept swooping in to tell her where not to go and why.  Then there's the marriage issue -- he wants to, she doesn't (it's embarrassing, you see...far more than having to tell one's family you intend to become a vampire in the near future because marriage is so much more shocking) -- but it's not like Bella has a say in the day that's supposed to be hers.  She literally doesn't.  It reminded me a little of an arrangement than a celebration with the amount of groaning and wincing Bella does concerning the upcoming nuptials.  <br /><br />What disturbed me more, besides the rickety plot, the endless comparisons to Wuthering Heights (the author studied literature in college, I get it.  most of us college educated people did and I still don't see the need for comparisons to Heathcliff and Cathy), and the annoying love triangle, was how self-deprecating Bella was.  How she constantly went through the book saying how unworthy she was of everyone, how at fault she was of everything, how clumsy, stupid, selfish (that one I actually don't argue with), immoral, weak, helpless, pathetic, and frighteningly normal she is.  Sure, it's hard to have immortal, strong, mostly male friends, but as a woman I'd like to see Bella shed that "oh well, I'm just a little weak girl, woe is me, I'll just sit in the corner and die now" attitude without having to become a vampire.  At every turn in Eclipse Bella depicts herself harshly, and the story does nothing to turn that around.  She's the one that wants to have sex outside of marriage (which is too immoral for virtuous Edward), she's the one that's too weak to do anything other than be babysat, and for the most part the story agrees with her.  The men (with the exception of possibly Alice) are the selfless heroes by the end, and the women are selfish (Bella), shallow (Rosalie), and bitter (Leah).  Where have the strong female role models gone?  <br />

Ahh...guilty pleasures...
I wasn't really sure how to rate these books, because in terms of literary quality they're certainly one star.  Yet, they're so delightfully cheesy that in terms of entertainment value, they probably rate a 5-star review.  Of course, I'm the girl that adores awful monster movies on the SciFi channel, so maybe you shouldn't trust my judgment.  :)<br /><br />But really folks these books are absolutely ridiculous.  They're so over the top they read like parodies of supernatural romance novels.  The characters' motivations and reactions defy any sort of real world logic.  These books just don't make any sense.  Like here's my main problem with the series: What in the world do all of these people see in Bella?  And I'm not just talking about Edward and Jacob.  That also includes Mike Newton, the entire Cullen family, Angela, and even Victoria and James from the first book.  The entire Twilight universe revolves around Bella. Everyone is obsessed with this girl. Why?  She's whiny, hypocritical, self-obsessed, co-dependent, moody, childish, sulky, I could go on, you get my drift. She has no goals, ambitions, hobbies, dreams, or talents. She shows no interest in the world around her.  She basically shows disdain and/or contempt for anyone in her life who isn't impossibly beautiful or superpowered--including her own parents. Her one goal in life is to become a vampire so she can live forever, be impossibly beautiful and strong, and never age.  Yes, this is our heroine, people.  Was I the only one rooting for Victoria to knock the hell out of her?<br /><br />Then of course there's Edward.  I believe I've read in SM's own words that Edward is her idea of the perfect man.  I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on that one.  And let me just say that I don't care how beautiful and gorgeous and perfect and wonderful a character is--NO ONE deserves to have 300 pages telling us these things.  If a character is supposed to be beautiful then I only need to be told that once, and then I'm looking for their more interesting aspects. If their beauty is brought up more than once than I'm going to assume that it's signficant to the story somehow...it relates to the plot, it's an ironic contrast to their not so beautiful inside, it serves as commentary for cultural perspectives on beauty. I don't want to get the idea that I'm reading about Edward's crooked smile, or bronze hair, or perfect chiseled features, or muscular chest over and over again because the author is imagining herself as the object of his affection and likes reminding everyone of how gorgeous he is.<br /><br />And Jacob...how did he go from a sweet kid to a rapist-in-training?  And why is SM so convinced that we're all going to adore this twerp as much as she does?  That said, as a character, he's still 1000 times more believable and better developed than Edward.<br /><br />Basically this book had so many unintentionally hilarious moments that I was imagining it as an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  There was Charlie's utterly bizarre reaction to Bella's breaking her hand...(What's that?  You tried to sexually assault my daughter? And she injured herself? Way to go tiger!) Bella's stupidity after Rosalie's backstory (Hmm...I think she's trying to tell me something about life and humanity and family, but all I can really focus on is that some hot vampire chick once came onto Edward..WAAAHHHH Edward!) Edward's rather psycho definition of love( He basically says "I don't care about anyone else. I only care about you. Only you matter.")  And the vampires' reactions (or rather non reaction) to the murder of the new vampire Bree disturbed me. They basically do nothing and have no reaction when a teenage girl is ripped to pieces right in front of them. Six months ago she was probably a normal teenager and now she's a pile of ashes and not one of the saintly "good" vampires even bothers to say "Poor girl.  I wonder if her family is looking for her?"  And these are the people that Bella wants to hang with for eternity?<br /><br />Hey I won't lie, I'll probably be buying the 4th book, but I have no expectations of quality or literary value, only that I'm going to entertained by more cheap melodrama and cheesy, pseudo-sensuality.

False Reviews???
My Original review on Aug. 10:<br />After finishing this book, I have no idea why it was written other than an excited writer's desire to fulfill a publisher's request as soon as possible. The writing was unevolved, and the sheer number of editorial errors proves how quickly both editor and author worked to release this book. Most of the issues that were brought up in the first two books were dropped in this one. To make matters worse, new issues abound that make the "willing suspension of disbelief" impossible, plot points are picked up and ignored randomly without any real twists or conclusions (except Vicky, of course), and you aren't really left with a character to love: Jake's forceful and annoying, Bella's negative and a martyr, Alice is pushy and superficial, and Edward is far too selfless.<br /><br />The first and last part of the book is filled with bickering and grumbling which is used to set a stage for Meyer's beautiful and witty sarcasm, but does little to enhance the plot. Without ruining anything, I'll just say that there actually comes a point where Bella has to resign herself to being with Edward. In general, the relationship between them is so obviously codependent and unhealthy, without any basis in a reality, that it's lost all of its original touching reluctance. By the end of the book, Bella's constant victim-stance, her bickering, complaining, whining, and general inability to be happy has ruined the book. <br /><br />UPDATE September 3, 2007: I am now absolutely DISGUSTED with both Meyers and her publisher. As soon as the rating fell below four stars, and almost all of the reviews commented on the same negative attributes, suddenly the reviews are flooded with five star, four sentence reviews from people who have nearly identical reviews on every other books they've posted for - falling in line with the newer trend of buying reviews for books. Shame on you Ms. Meyers for not letting your product stand on its own, and shame on you for disrespecting the loyal followers of your series in such a manner by telling them that their opinions are worth as much as cheaply bought props.

Enormously Disappointing
I gave this book one star because, for me, only about twenty percent of it was worth reading.  Chapters 7, 11, 13, and 24 were very entertaining.  The scenes depicting the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob play out like a bad soap opera, painfully ridiculous.  And as I see it Bella has no redeeming qualities- why are these guys wanting her so bad anyway?  She is hugely self-centered, needy, and whiney.  I feel bad for the guy that does end up with her, but this book has ruined the series for me so I won't be there to find out who that poor fellow is.  I think this book does young girls a huge disservice as to what their expectations of a boyfriend/ husband should be; not to mention what is acceptable or desirable behavior from a girl.

what in the world happened?
I was excited for this book to come out a year before it even did. I went in with the expectation that Eclipse, like New Moon and Twilight, would yield further plot development, answer whether Bella was turned into a vampire, and resolve her friendship with Jacob.<br /><br />I actually put this book down about four hundred pages in because it simply was not going anywhere. Sure, it's mentioned that there is danger, yet once again, but it's never really fleshed out. We're never put in the thick of it. I warn you, this book is nothing but a "Do I love Jacob? Do I love Edward? Gosh, they both treat me terribly but it's not like I don't do the same!"<br /><br />I waited for the characters to do SOMETHING redeeming, or just SOMETHING period. I finally gave up when I realized that a series I'd liked very much had just become nothing more than a badly written romance novel.<br /><br />Extremely disappointing. <br /><br />I really liked Jacob, but after his sexual harassment tactics that were actually played off as "cute" in the book, I'd sock him with a metal pole myself :(<br /><br />God, what a letdown!

Bella Bore
I think one other person finally brought this up, but I must agree. What does everyone in the book see in Bella? It's rather unbelievable that two strong, "hot" men of any age (human or not) would find a weak, seemingly talentless, and "plain" girl so compelling. I loved Twilight. Bella and Edward had an energy I haven't seen in characters in a very long time. I was willing to overlook Bella's damsel in distress deal, because I figured she would grow as a character. As a writer myself, I prefer to write about realistic heroines. Not all of them start off strong, but many grow and learn to love themselves more. It doesn't matter if the book is fantasy or reality; it's the realistic human element that allows readers to connect to the characters. <br /><br />That being said, what does Bella have to offer? She's not particularly smart. She has no goals in life outside of loving Edward and being with him forever and ever. Blah. She scoffs at the idea of going to Dartmouth. Empowering the mind through education??? Psh, she's too girly to do that! Has anyone ever noticed that she has no real hobbies? I love a main character with quirks and passions in life. Bella spends her days being rescued and, well, that's about it. It's the 21st century and women still have to struggle to be taken seriously. Let's get with it by presenting female characters that, sure, make mistakes, but reflect the incredible strength that most women have. I know I do. <br /><br />That being said, there was a flicker of hope when Bella had second thoughts about marriage. I'm quite surprised at the amount of reviewers who supported Edward on the 'let's get married' view. Am I the only one who would find a guy manipulating me into marrying him extremely unattractive? When I was 17, I would have laughed in the guy's face at such a ludicrous suggestion. Gone is the sarcastic, deliciously arrogant and slightly mysterious Edward. He's been replaced by a needy sap who hasn't had a date  in the 100 years he's been around? Come on, ladies. If he's as smoldering as Meyer suggests (I haven't counted, but I'm guessing there is a reference to it on every page), surely he would have had a few dates under his belt by now. I was hoping that the whole storyline with Rosalie suggesting there had been women in Edward's life before would play out as a secret he'd been keeping from Bella. That would have made him more real to me. Hey, I've  made a few mistakes, but I love you now, honey puff (gag). What he comes off as, instead, is a naive female fantasy boy. I find that pretty boring, but I've always preferred the male love interest to be a bit rough around the edges. I find imperfections endearing, and more importantly, REAL. <br /><br />Which brings me to Jacob. Aside from his unrealistic obsession with Bella, he is the most realistic character in the series at this point. For one thing, he acts like a 16 year old boy, right down to the barrage of immature comments and sloppy kisses. I can't really say he's a likable character for me, simply because he reminds me too much of the really bad dates I had in high school. Needless to say, I found their "hot embrace" towards the end more vile than anything else. I also don't understand why either character has any feelings for the other one at all? What do they have in common? <br /><br />Alice was an interesting character in the first book. I like her little fashion quirks, but I cannot understand her patience with Bella. Since she's not in love with Bella, it makes little sense that she's put up with as much as she has. When Bella was making snotty comments at their little slumber party, I was waiting for Alice to become disgusted. <br /><br />  Disappointment is an understatement for me. I admit that I'm extremely picky when it comes to characters. I find most to be 2D and underdeveloped or just plain boring. Twilight had a magic above and beyond the books I've read in the last few years. I was excited to finally be drawn in by something again. When New Moon came out, I didn't like it nearly as much, but I still had some hope that Bella would develop as a character. Eclipse sealed the deal for me. I'll be happy not to read another page of Bella's self-deprecating and mundane blather. I'm sorry this is so harsh, but sometimes the author needs to hear the truth. My suggestion would be to forget your own morals, and think about what the characters in your book would realistically do. Stop forcing them to be so virtuous (ahem Edward). And please, pump some life into Bella. <br /><br />At this point the only thing that redeem this series is if Breaking Dawn went a little like this: Bella ditches Edward and pursues a career as an FBI agent, joins the marines, decides to become a professional bum or something else completely unlike her. Oh, and Edward and Jacob hook up. Was  I the only one that noticed the sexual tension between those two? It couldn't have all been about Bella.

I can't be the only one...
Is it just me, or am I the only person out there who is mildly revolted with the thinly-disguised Mormon ethos present in all of Meyers' works?<br /><br />I read these books because, as an illustrator, I want to know what's going on in the teen lit world, and anytime somebody gets labeled something histrionic ('The Next J.K. Rowling'), I'm curious. Unquestionably, this author has worked very hard to crank out some seriously long novels that are seriously packed with - well, not really plot, or action, and a great deal of thin, meandering dialogue - so I'm not quite sure what's in each book, but I do not doubt for one second that the passion of her romance writing is bizarrely gripping. I read all three of these books faster than whatever book I last read in the airport, and that's saying something. What does it say? Well, she certainly knows how to move at a literary clip.<br /><br />What does astonish me are the swarms of fans comparing her to Jane Austen (!!) and the utterly irresponsible path the books have taken in embracing what I presume to be a Mormon dictate: get married right out of high school, education is secondary to marriage and love, and never, ever stand up for yourself in front of a man. Women in the church are still subjugated no matter how liberated they may think they are, and this truism is decidedly present in the so-called arc her protagonist takes.<br /><br />I am also amazed that the author herself can state that her religion defines everything she writes, and yet nobody seems to mind - or know - that these teen romances are then 'defined' by it. They aren't only for sale in Christian bookstores, are they?<br /><br />I'm always glad when young people get excited to read. I love the statistic about juvenile crime dropping on the days when Harry Potter books are released to the public. How can that not be to the good? But why on earth do young women have to be spoon-fed the idea that sitting around and waiting for a boy to sweep them away is how their life should be defined? It makes me sad that packaging up that notion in a glossy cover fools girls into thinking it's not only great literature, but what they should strive for.<br /><br />EDIT: I am gratified to have gotten repeated comments on this review, regardless of negativity. I am also gratified for my judgments to have been corroborated by the author herself in the conclusion to this series, 'Breaking Dawn.' Therefore, my assessment of the subtext was correct.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
No, No, No, NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have never in my life been more upset and disappointed in a series. The first book was great. It really was, but I cannot believe for the life of me why the author didn't EVOLVE or PROGRESS the actual story line, or main characters in any way throughout a span of 2 EXTRA, UNNEEDED books. <br /><br />If you enjoy reading books about powerful, helpful, strong and smart women do NOT read these books. The main character, Bella, never grows, never becomes any stronger, or any more useful. She stays a pathetic wreck the whole time. As a young woman myself, I am utterly disgusted that the author is (in my eyes) promoting unhealthy, dangerous, and emotionally abusive relationships to young, growing, impressionable high school aged females. The ONLY reason why I read the end half of New Moon, and the whole book of Eclipse was because I truly wanted to see pathetic Bella make the right choice, and become a happy, healthy woman. <br /><br />But obviously, by the tone of my review, she failed to do so. Just as she failed to set a good example for young women. If you have self respect, self confidence, usefulness, a sense of worth, a healthy emotional boundary or common sense, you will not find ANYTHING in common with Bella. I would have stopped reading these sequels all together if it weren't for Jacob. Having that said, there was NO reason to bring him so deeply into the story. There was no HEALTHY reason why the author should have brought Jacob in the way that she did. It got messy, stupid and ultimately, he was just EXTRA because he has nothing to do in the "outcome" of the book. NOTHING. He's just there to show how extraordinarily crappy Bella really is, even WITHOUT Edward. <br /><br />It is hard enough for young women these days to get a handle on their teen years, and even harder for women of ANY age to get away from a bad relationship even though a good one is staring them in the face. I'm only 20, but I've been through enough to know that this book's messages are wrong. There are a lot of harmful things in life that love can do to a young woman. Unhealthy and hurtful things. If I knew that this series would have gone this route, I NEVER would have read it. If I were a high schooler again, reading these books, the messages would have sent me down a completely different path, an unwise and unhealthy path. <br /><br />Here are some things that I believe, that the books send opposite messages about: <br /><br />Unhealthy relationships are not good. <br /><br />Emotional abuse is not okay. <br /><br />Getting back together with someone who put you in a catatonic state for close to year is not the right choice. <br /><br />Reckless behavior should be avoided. Not sought after. <br /><br />Using people for your own selfish benefit is never okay. <br /><br />Love triangles are not healthy for anyone involved. <br /><br />A boyfriend at age 17 is not more important than friends, your mother, your father, and especially not your life! <br /><br />Disobeying, lying and sneaking around your father is not good. Police chief, or otherwise. <br /><br />Putting yourself in dangerous situations where you could be raped or killed is not going to send a prince charming barreling to your rescue. You will just be raped or killed for being reckless, helpless and stupid. <br /><br />Being pathetic and WEAK will not get you multiple strong and caring boyfriends! It's ludicrous!! <br /><br />Yes, this is a fictional book, but there are morals and lessons to be seen and absorbed. Examples to be set. I finished reading the series 2 days ago, and after I read the last epilogue about Jacob Black I launched the book sailing across the room into a door frame, thus cracking the spine. I have YET to cease being FURIOUS. <br /><br />In conclusion, there are ridiculously irresponsible lessons for young women to walk away with, the whole series could have been ONE book because the main characters do not GROW or PROGRESS in anyway, and the only character I ever sympathized or cared about is screwed over in the end. <br /><br />I apologize if any of this is incoherent. I am still trembling with RAGE.

All hype, no substance
I have to admit, I didn't enjoy Twilight as much as those around me did, but I trudged through it. Then came New Moon and I thought that it wasn't so bad. And then came Eclipse and I realize I should have gone with my gut...these books are all hype and no substance. The characters are so far removed from actual people you would meet and interact with, that you can't help but cringe as you read their reactions to the things happening to them.<br /><br />I think Bella is the most annoying, whiny, self obsessed, hypocrtical main character I have had the pleasure of encountering. What is it that everyone sees in her? She is moody, has no hobbies, is plain and pretty much a bore. Then on top of all that she's a klutz and can't stand the sight of blood. How does she think she will manage being a vampire??? All for love...no, not for love, but because she does not want to age.<br /><br />I went into this book with an open mind, hoping things would be tied into a nice bow and we'd get some answers and the characters would learn some life lessons. They didn't grow and they didn't seem to learn a thing. Let's see what I learned...that it's ok to hurt those around you because you love them. It's ok to be a brat because your hearts in the right place. It's ok to say no to a great college because the love of your life wants to pay for it. It's ok to be a typical weak female, because you will be rescued by not one, but two hot guys. I could go on, but I won't.<br /><br />I have to wonder what book people are reading that have given this one 5 stars...surely they must be under a vamp's spell.

Long, heavy and I should never have bothered
This was "drivvle". I was looking for a mature story with thrills and spills. Instead, this was tiresome. It deserved a stronger 3D characterisation on all key characters, especially the 'triangle' of Bella, Edward and Jacob. <br />To be honest, the thing I liked most, was the cover, and the series of covers for the trilogy, or book series.<br /><br />Other disappointments include the repetitious elements of dialogue, plotline, emotions and description.<br /><br />I'm 24, and no longer a teenager but there are better examples of driving teen drama books that cover romance, vampires, thrills, and love triangle.<br /><br />Skip this book and don't be sucked in by the cover!<br /><br />P.S. A redeeming feature - no exposition of previous plotlines - something I enjoyed too.

deeply disappointing
Stephanie Meyer has said, on more than one occasion, that the story of Bella and Edward was one of true, epic, love. That it wasn't just a story of teen romance - that there was nothing else like it. And I believed! So I was completely blindsided (as I'm sure were the rest of the believers) to have this truly one of a kind love story turned into a truly depressing  love triangle. <br /><br />Bella has gone from a girl who has found and is capable of true love to a girl who does the kind of things only a person with a real lack of maturity and compassion is capable of. The Bella we met in Twilight would never have been tempted by what Jacob had to offer or done any of the horrible things she does to Edward in Eclipse. She's lost her relatability.  Not many people would do any of those things to a mediocre boyfriend much less the love of their lives. Jacob has gone from a sweet kid to a man-beast who at his best is immature and at his worst is truly villainous (the whole lying and I'll kill myself if you don't make out with me was repugnant - almost as bad as the fact that Bella - Bella! went for it and Stephenie - Stephanie! wrote this as a love scene!) and Edward is taking poundings from both of them at every turn.<br /><br />The author must really love Jacob's character - it's the only explanation for what she's done to all of us. But please, please, write a separate series for Jacob and do what you can to salvage Bella and Edward. Do it for those of us who believed.

I don't see how people could like this book.
I am giving this book one star, because it entertained me slightly.  I could barely make myself finish it, though.  Bella is the most unlikable, horrible person ever--yet she's supposed to be a sympathetic character.<br /><br />Although I liked the first book, my review will take her character from the beginning.<br /><br />A plainish, clutzy girl moves in with her dad in a new town in Washington.  All the guys have crushes on her and most girls want to be her friend.  Of course, she is annoyed by this and doesn't want friends or boys to like her, except Edward, who she is obsessed with.  She's not that into school and not very smart.<br /><br />She gives up what few friends she has and doesn't care at all what she will do to her parents so she can be with Edward, and is willing to leave everything she's ever known behind.  She doesn't listen to Rosalie's good advice, and only is jealous after Rosalie pours her heart out to her.  <br /><br />She doesn't have any ambitions (except to become a vampire so she can be with Edward forever).  She doesn't want to go to a good college (Dartmouth), and for some reason is insanely anti-marriage.  She is a skank who tries to get Edward to have sex with her, even though it is dangerous.<br /><br />She uses Jacob and falls in love with two guys and you're supposed to think, "Poor Bella," right?  WRONG.<br /><br />She has NO redeeming qualities.  If there was such a person as Bella, she wouldn't have any friends or guys who love her.  <br /><br />If I had a chance to be as lucky as her, I probably would have dated Mike or Jacob like a normal person, instead of being psycho!<br /><br />Now, there's Edward.  I used to love him, but in Eclipse he was an abusive control freak!  Instead of being mad at him for disabling her car so she has NO freedom, she can't stay mad at him and opens her window up as far as it will go so he'll climb in and cuddle with her.  I was shocked.  That is not realistic or healthy.  She should have been mad at him for days!  She's obviously addicted to him or something!<br /><br />Beyond that, the plot was boring-ish.  It was ok, though, and I was able to finish it.<br /><br />It makes me so angry that Stephenie Meyers sold out like this.  In my opinion, she doesn't stand up for women, but rather encourages negative stereotypes of skanky damsels in distress.  <br /><br />What makes me most angry, though, is that this book is so successful.  There are much better authors out there that deserve money and support (check out Brandon Sanderson).  I refuse to buy any more of Stephenie Meyers books.

The Worst Book Ever
While I've been known to exaggerate on occasion, I promise you I'm being completely serious when I say Breaking Dawn is the worst book I have ever read.  The writing was atrocious, there was no drama and/or real conflict, and Meyer broke her own rules.  Repeatedly.<br /><br />Let's begin, shall we?<br /><br />First, the writing itself was a huge problem.  It's nearly impossible for me to believe Meyer was an English major in college.  Maybe she was technically a literature major, but either way, she should have been exposed to enough decent writing to know how to produce it herself.  And if she couldln't produce it from her own head, she probably had enough references to replicate it.  Instead, Breaking Dawn reads like a terrible fanfiction.  Meyer tends to overuse adjectives and adverbs, but does so in the least descriptive way possible.  How did Bella look on her wedding day?  I couldn't tell you, since Meyer never bothered to describe her dress other than to say it was satin-y.  And how about the rest of the wedding ceremony?  There were flowers "everywhere" and everyone looked "amazing."  Thanks.  I can totally picture that.<br /><br />Bella is also the ultimate Mary Sue, which doesn't help Meyer's writing skills in my eyes.  Bella is SO PERFECT.  Everyone LOVES HER.  Meyer's lame attempts to make Bella relatable by making her clumsy fall flat (pun intended), because the other characters think injury-prone Bella is adorable.  Will Charlie object to Bella Sue getting married at 18?  Of course not!  Will Bella Sue become the most graceful vampire ever, even though she was the world's clumsiest person?  You bet!  Bella gets everything she wants in Breaking Dawn and sacrifices nothing.<br /><br />There was also a conspicuous lack of drama and conflict in what should have been an epic conclusion to a series.  As I mentioned above, Bella had no problem convincing Charlie that marrying Edward was the right decision.  I was expecting more of an objection from the ol' sheriff.  Denied.  Jacob does make a small attempt to talk Bella out of turning into a vampire, but what could have been another interesting conversation is brushed aside by Bella.  Why would she miss anybody she knew as a human?  She'll be with her beloved Edward for all eternity; that's all she needs.<br /><br />The sexy-time was also lacking.  I'm not much of a smut fan, but I was hoping for more than a cheezy "fade to black" when Edward and Bella finally do the deed.  After three books of anticipation and denial, Meyer doesn't have the balls to give us more than Bella walking toward Edward in the water.  Seriously, Meyer?  You can show Bella vomiting "a fountain of blood" but kissing before sex is too shocking?  Nothing interesting here, folks.<br /><br />There is also the issue of Bella's pregnancy.  Nowhere in the previous three books, and I mean NOWHERE, did Bella mention a desire to be a mother.  But as soon as Edward gets his vampire sperm inside her, she decides that motherhood is the most important thing on Earth.  (Inconsistent much, Meyer?  Another sign of bad writing!)  I was expecting Bella to freak out, get angry at Edward, and blame him for ruining her life when she thought she could never get pregnant!  But instead, Bella is inexplicably calm and instantly bonds with her "little nudger."  Again, any drama that could have been just melted like an ice cube in Death Valley.  The plot floats along...<br /><br />The previously mentioned "fountain of blood" happens when Bella goes into labor.  To make a long and rather gruesome story short, the baby almost kills Bella, and would have, had Edward not turned Bella into a vampire.  Bella lays on a table for a couple of days until the venom stops her heart.  She's dead!  Let the crazed baby vampire gather her bearings!  She's dangerous right now!  Right?  Wrong.  Bella Sue is the perfect vampire, so graceful and strong.  She requires almost no adjustment time, even though Meyer told us in previous books that new vampires are totally out of control.  Again, all conflict nipped in the bud.<br /><br />This leads us to Meyer breaking her own rules.  Bella is totally in control of herself as a new vampire even though, according to Meyer's own words, it's totally normal and EXPECTED to have a lenghty adjustment period.  Jasper struggled for years, but Bella gets the hang of things in a day.  Of course.  Meyer breaks the rules so Bella Sue can have her perfect life.<br /><br />Meyer also gets into a sticky situation with Bella's pregnancy.  According to Meyer, speaking through (I believe) Carlisle, vampires don't have any liquid in their bodies except for their venom.  Last time I checked, sperm isn't venomous.  Getting Bella pregnant should have been impossible if Meyer followed her own rules!  That entire plot device (which only served to give Jacob something to imprint on) was an amateurish cop out that I would expect to find in fanfiction, not a novel written by an adult with a college degree.<br /><br />Oh yeah, they named the baby Renesmee.  Vomit.<br /><br />And then Jacob imprints on it.  Double vomit.<br /><br />Allow me to backtrack for a second. I forgot to mention another scene that should have been exciting but wasn't: the confrontation with the Volturi.  Yep, the leaders are back and they want to kill the Cullens for making an "immortal child."  Finally, some action!  The Cullens invite some vampire friends to gather at their house and fight the Volturi, which should be the epic conflict we've all been waiting for!  Except it most definitely is not.  It turns out that Bella has a shield she controls with her mind.  All the does is put the sheild around everybody and they're impervious to weapons.  The Volturi stand around and talk for a while and then... leave.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn was a letdown in every sense.  Meyer's writing didn't improve (it got worse, actually), there wasn't any tension or action, and a lot of the rules established in the first three books got thrown out the window.<br /><br />Avoid this book at all costs.<br /><br />(Note: Don't be fooled by the high number of five-star reviews; a lot of them are two sentences long and say things like, "BELLA AND EDWARD ARE IN LOVE!!!!1!11one"  They may very well be, but that doesn't make it a good book.)

Heartbreak of Heathcliff Proportions
I've only recently entered the Twilight fold.  Having initially read reviews of the series in library journals and having heard passionate testimonials from avid fans, I thought I would give it a try.  <br /><br />Inexorably, I fell absolutely and positively in love with the first three Twilight books.  I read them (the first time, that is) in three days.  Then, like a junkie, I feverishly searched the media for news on the movie, the books, and all things Stephanie Meyers.  <br /><br />Stephenie Meyer's books were my brand of heroin.  <br /><br />So, like millions of other strung out addicts, I lined up until midnight to score the ultimate fix. The final installment was in my hands. <br /><br />I didn't know I was holding a ticking time bomb in my hands.  One which would ultimately implode, destroying the magic spell of Meyer's world and the intense affection I held for its inhabitants. <br /><br />Like many of you, I kept asking myself: "Who actually wrote this book? What happened? This must be a cruel joke...I will wake up tomorrow, and learn that Breaking Dawn is an elaborate hoax perpetrated to discredit Meyer." <br /><br />Meyer has commented on her love of Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  Having read these books dozens of times, I saw glimmers of their bittersweet brilliance in the first three Twilight books.  I cried for Bella as I had cried for Cathy, Elizabeth, and Juliet.<br /><br />And then I read Breaking Dawn. <br /><br />For the first one hundred pages, I was entranced. I couldn't put the book down.  I thought, "Finally, Bella and Edward can consummate their love, against seemingly impossible odds! Finally, the big payoff is here!" <br /><br />Then, the heartbreak began... <br /><br />Remember when Bella's heart cracks in two in Eclipse?  Mine shattered the moment I read the words "little nudger."  <br /><br />When I read the first three books, I felt seventeen again.  The butterflies in my stomach, the blinding tunnel vision, and the intense emotions experienced during that first love washed over me during Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  <br /><br />When Jacob left at the end of Eclipse, I cried. The price of true love was justly paid with his departure.  <br /><br />Price...A lot of the reviews I've read here aptly speak of "paying a price."  Intense, obsessive, passionate love--a love of the Wuthering Heights variety, anyway--demands an exacting price. Bella cannot have Jacob and Edward, just as Catherine cannot have both Edgar and her beloved Heathcliffe.  <br /><br />The price of an extraordinary love is an ordinary life. <br /><br />But the price--the sacrifice--makes the purchase more dear, makes it all the sweeter. <br /><br />In Breaking Dawn, what price is paid?  Bella gets Edward.  Bella gets Jacob. Bella gets beauty and grace.  Bella gets a baby. Bella gets a fairytale cottage.  Bella gets all the powerful trappings of vampiric power without all the burden of newborn instincts.  Bella gets to keep her human family.  Bella gets Meyer's "perfect ending." <br /><br />The perfect ending comes at what price?  <br /><br />The price is the love story, the plot, and the character development.  The price is seeing Jacob turn from a noble suitor who knows when to bow out, into a toddler's pet.  <br /><br />The price is seeing the endearingly vulnerable Bella turn into a perfect shell of her former self.  <br /><br />The price is seeing Edward, who was once a continuously smoldering cauldron of desire, degraded to a level of abject affliction. <br /><br />The price is watching Charlie turn from a loving and protective father into a "don't need to know" Homer Simpson.  <br /><br />The price is having to stomach a bloodbath,a mutant birth which rivals the absurdity of the alien reptile baby delivery of the "V" TV miniseries of the 1980's.  (Remember that one, gentle reader?)<br /><br />Bella's surrender of her human life to Edward should have ended intimately with his lips caressing her throat, not with fountains of blood spewing from her mouth as Jacob watches. <br /><br />The price is too steep--much too heartbreaking--for me to pay.<br /><br />My opinion is inconsequential.  It matters to no one but me, but...<br /><br />Not that you asked but...Ms. Meyer, you are a fantastically talented writer.  You have the power to spin a story which transcends the ordinary  and transports teens and housewives alike into a world of sparkling, amorous, and compelling fantasy. You are the real deal.<br /><br />What hast thou wrought?  <br /><br />I know that you, like any writer worth his or her salt, wrote this book for yourself, for your own satisfaction.  You wrote the story of Breaking Dawn for you.  <br /><br />I'm just so heartbroken that it wasn't written for me.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

So bad, I want to rewrite it myself
I started reading this series after I heard a rave review on NPR during their "Guilty Pleasures" segment.  The middle-aged gentleman described Twilight with such enthusiasm that I couldn't resist temptation.  I bought the four-book set and settled in for a long weekend of reading.  <br /><br />Three days and 2400 pages later, I'd finished the four novels.  I adored Twilight, tried not to slap whiny Bella during New Moon, and mostly skimmed through Eclipse trying to get to something interesting.  Finally, I got to Breaking Dawn.  I have never been so let down by a book in my entire life.  I don't even need to go into all the ways that this book was horrible - the other reviewers have done that well.  But, here I go anyway:<br /><br />Wedding - So, Bella's wedding to Edward was not what she wanted, but what she was willing to trade for sex and immortality.  The wedding itself was not her vision and in no way represented their unique love, but was instead a fantasy created fully by Alice's vision.  <br /><br />Honeymoon - Meyer is telling us that sex is scary and awful.  You will have a lot of pain your first time and your husband, who puts you up on a pedestal, will hate himself for "hurting" you, no matter how yummy delicious it is.  Oh, and once you do get some, it's pretty much the only thing you'll want, and your new hubby will reject you, mercilessly, due to his own hang ups.  Woo!  I gotta get me some of that!<br /><br />Also, how come it's either a little french kissing or sex?  How come no one ever talks about alllll that space in between those two extremes?  What a perfect place for her to talk about sex and the implications of it, especially given her target audience.  <br /><br />Pregnancy - You will get pregnant the very first time you have sex.  Pregnancy is the most horrible state you will ever experience.  It will be stunningly painful as your body is taken over by something that hurts you, and tries to kill you, and eventually chews its way out of you.  The bloodbath of child birth is fine - but it says a lot, to me, about Meyer that she can't write the sex, but can write the gore.  Or maybe it's about society, and not Meyer at all.  Take your pick.<br /><br />Renesmee - Say it out loud.  I dare you.  Look, I get what Meyer was trying to convey here about the beauty of having a child, the connection that a newborn's family feels to the child and how fleeting childhood is.  But come on!  The massive gaps in logic and leaps of faith it takes you to get here are stunning.  Stunning.  And impossible.<br /><br />Jacob - Sigh.  Poor Jacob.  This boy never had an ounce of pride, he submitted it all to Bella, only to find himself a pedophile in the end.  How utterly freaking awful.  (and yeah, I tried to go with the whole "it's fiction, not pedophilia" but I just couldn't get there.  It was creepy.)<br /><br />The Cullens - Who?  No seriously though, Edward had a family?  Where were they after page 150?<br /><br />Renee and Charlie - So, while Renee has been the primary parent and the person that Bella is closest to for the entire series, suddenly she's just...absent.  Laaaame.  And suddenly Charlie is Bella's first concern, but we've been given absolutely nothing by way of character development to buy into this.  Again, I say: Come on!<br /><br />Editing:  Look, I don't know who edited this book, but ZOMG! fire that person.  There were so many errors it was distracting.  Dialog tagging: use it.  Also, adverbs are not your friends.  If Bella "shyly" does one more thing, I'm going beat her with her own arm.  If you have to tell us that people are chuckling, giggling, that their eyes are "tightening" (wth does that even mean?) then you're failing at description.  If you must tell and not show, read some Willa Cather.  She gets away with it.  You don't.  So stop.<br /><br />Tone:  I'm guessing that Meyer took a break from Twilight land to write "The Host" and that's why the entire tone of this novel is off.  It just doesn't even sound like it was written by the same person.  <br /><br />At the end of this novel, I wanted to rewrite the whole thing myself.  I wanted to see why Bella decided that she would marry Edward.  I wanted her to give a damn about the wedding and see some reverence in it.  I wanted to see a real deepening in her relationship with Alice.  I wanted Esme to be more than just a paper doll mother figure.  I wanted a real, honest to goodness sex scene that lived up to three freaking novels worth of some of the steamiest kisses ever.  I wanted Bella to pay a price for some of her choices.  I wanted that epic battle with the Volturi to actually happen.  I wanted someone to die.  Meyer cheated us out of the thoughtful endings that we get when good triumphs over evil.  That's what makes life sweet, and makes us appreciate what we have - working for it, sacrificing for it.  <br /><br />Bella would have actually wanted to marry Edward.  She would have cared about the decorations and Alice would have developed into a real sister, and not some overblown party planner.  There would have been real sex - not smutty, but real, nonetheless.  Pregnancy would have disappeared.  Bella would have had to make the choice - between having babies and having Edward.  She would have been cruel to be kind and given Jacob his freedom.  Jacob would have grown and gotten over her, and moved on and found real love with someone who loved him back - maybe even Leah, since that ground was laid pretty well.  Bella would have spent months being a newborn, filled with nothing but bloodlust.  Jessica would be her first victim.  The Cullens would have worked tirelessly to help her transform, and we could have gotten to know them all so much better.  Rosalie might have died, doing something selfless for once in her life.  That would have been doubly meaningful if Meyer rewrites the whole series from Edward's POV (ala Midnight Sun, which in rough draft form is head and shoulders better than Breaking Dawn.) Bella would have to give up Charlie and Renee for a while, but eventually they would be able to be in her life, altho in a much more limited way.  There are a million possibilities that could have had a very nice happy ending, with a bit of bitter thrown in with the sweet.  <br /><br />Meyer is a great storyteller and an okay writer.  If she gets a better editor and learns some discipline, she could be very good.  I found this particular book to be a total betrayal of the earlier books, which is why my review is so harsh.  Overall, I hope she keeps going, and I *really* hope she keeps going with Midnight Sun, which so far, I love.

Sickening
Sorry about the length of this, but I am absolutely livid about this book. I am angry at myself for reading the trash, but exponentially more furious at Stephenie Meyer for writing it. This book is an insult. If you are a fan of the series, over the age of 12 and/or have an IQ above 50, then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. PLEASE listen to me. Thank God I didn't spend a penny on it.<br /><br />Everything that made the romance between Edward and Bella so great has absolutely been destroyed. Gone are the cute, innocent teenagers who fall into an impossible romance in the cafeteria. I don't think I can ever read or watch Twilight again. I mean, I always slightly cringed when it was obvious that a modern teenager had nothing to do with any of these books. (ex. "Holy Crow?" Even my GRANDMOTHER doesn't say that.) Or the sometimes over-the-top sappy exposition and dialogue. But I could deal. But this BOOK. It was like watching my childhood stuffed animal get... um, defiled. It was that horrifying. <br /><br />I understand the concept of author's prerogative, but ANY author has a responsibility to 1) Keep leaps of logic to a minimum, which definitely excludes some weird, mutant child of the corn, 2) Keep the plots and characters consistent throughout the series within the framework which the author has set up, and 3) Follow basic rules of writing and editing a novel designed for an intelligent audience. All 3 of which were shockingly snubbed in Breaking Dawn. <br /><br />Please, please, please. Do yourself a favor and stop reading at Eclipse, or better yet, at New Moon or Twilight, and fill in the very few blanks for yourself. I will never criticize an author for having an ambiguous ending again. Just click on "Most Helpful Reviews" and you will see the many, many people who feel the same way. <br /><br />*SPOILERS AHEAD, but you should probably read this part anyway to realize just how awful this book is*<br /><br />Here are a few of the many, many problems I have with this book:<br /><br />1) So Edward and Bella get married and that part's pretty cute, even though I think it would have made more sense to transform her first, since that's how they're planning to spend their marriage. They get married at the very beginning of the book, and Bella doesn't even really want to. She agreed because she wants to get laid. Wow, warms the heart.<br />Then begins the vomit-inducing 700 pages. <br /><br />2) Edward and Bella have sex. A lot. Effectively ruining the innocence of their cute romance and turning it into some trashy, thinly-veiled-porn novella you buy at the airport. Sex is at the very least alluded to in almost every scene they have together. They like it. We get it.<br />But that's not the worst part. Even while she is HUMAN. Um, Edward is a creature who literally turns iron into dust and moves as fast as a speeding car without breaking a sweat. And she wants him to have SEX with her as she is?! How the HELL would that be 1) Enjoyable for him, and 2) Not life-threatening for her?! Not only does Bella whine, manipulate, and cry her way into doing this outrageously stupid and selfish thing (totally decimated my respect for her character), but then Edward, totally out of character, gives into her crap and agrees to TRY. TRY?! Why don't I just TRY to juggle chainsaws?! And for what? So she can GET SOME a little bit ahead of schedule? She can't bear to have her first time unless she's worried about Edward breaking her in HALF?! If I was Edward, had Bella even suggested such a thing I would have first laughed myself silly, then run screaming in the other direction from such a reckless lunatic. That whole thing really pissed me off.<br /><br />3) Pregnant. 17-year-old vampire Edward and 18-year-old human Bella. Ew. Ew. Ew. I can accept the marriage, because Edward will never get older, and they love each other. But when I got to that part, and both of their reactions to it, I wanted to scream I was so angry. It is just so small and stupid, so out of place in the story, and CONTRIVED. Ugh! As so many other people said, I thought it was Fanfiction I was reading, not a published work, let alone from the actual author. I'm curious as to what Meyer was smoking when she thought this was an appropriate plot line. But it got worse. What suspension of disbelief I had left broke, and I became permanently removed from the story. I began to hate Bella, and resent Edward's cardboard characterization. <br /><br />4) Their weird mutant spawn literally kills Bella slowly. And she couldn't be more thrilled about it.<br /> The fact that Meyer had made the ridiculously immature, but lovable and relatable teenager Bella PREGNANT was bad enough. But then it is with some weird, unknown mutant parasite, that saps all her strength, breaks several of her bones (including her SPINE) and causes various bruises, and makes her drink HUMAN BLOOD. During Bella's pregnancy, I was literally shuddering with disgust on almost every page. That is not an exaggeration. And I'm 19. <br />No joke, I was rooting for the wolves to attack the Cullens and kill the thing. Bella and Edward's characters fly so far off their character rails that you can't even see them any more. Bella whole-heartedly embraces the thing while it slowly kills her, and Edward does nothing but hopelessly mope about it. <br /><br />5) The birth and Bella's transformation. <br />UGGGGHHHH. This was hands-down the most disturbing passage I have ever read. I had to put the book down to take some deep breaths several times out of anger and disgust, and then wrestle with myself about whether or not to keep reading multiple times on one page. My Edward and Bella. Who fell in love as lab partners, and cutely fought because of their stubborn personalities. <br /><br />Here, Bella, dieing and screaming in agony, vomits blood while the mutant baby inside of her destroys her body, internal organs and spine. Edward uses his teeth to bite the baby out of her uterus. Bella dies and then Edward injects vampire venom into her heart with a syringe.<br /><br />This is how Bella starts her new life with him. TOTAL Slap. In. The. Face. <br /><br />I was ready to drive to Arizona, find Stephenie Meyer's house, and burn it down.<br /><br />6) Renesmee. This is what Bella names their child. Ruh. Nez. May. A combination of Renee and Esme. Seriously?<br /><br />Seriously, Stephenie Meyer? <br /><br />Why didn't you just sell a book that just says, "To all my fans: F%*# YOU."<br /><br />When Bella tells her father that the baby's middle name is Carlie, I thought, "well, that's not so bad." Then she says that it's a combination of "Charlie" and "Carlisle." <br /><br />Again, I considered driving to Arizona. <br /><br />7) Bella as vampire. One of the things that made this series so great was how seemingly-impossible and different the relationship with her and Edward was. She literally had to give up her humanity, her family, and her whole life, in order to have a future with him, but she decided that the love of her life was worth it. It's a difficult, heart-breaking choice and I really liked that. But no. All of a sudden, Bella has it all. She is infinitely more beautiful, graceful, powerful, inexplicably becomes supermom at 18, and still retains all the parts of her humanity she was afraid to lose. She has a child, she stays in Forks, and tells her family. There are mentions of her carrying wads of five thousand dollars like it was chump change, which is BEYOND out of character. Waiters "gasp" at her beauty. She also becomes sickeningly vain. Then they run off to a little storybook cottage her new family has just given her for free, and Edward and Bella "make love" in it like rabbits every chance they get. If Bella had any relatability left, especially for teenagers, she lost it. This also applies to the believability of the story as a whole and the complexity of the Twilight characters.<br /><br />8) Jacob and Renesmee. <br />Jacob, the cute and friendly guy (but also rapist-in-training in Eclipse) who is painfully in love with and loyal to Bella, imprints (falls in love with) on her newborn BABY. This is beyond sick and pedophilic. But it's ok. He's willing to "share" the baby with Bella and Edward. Bella and Edward quickly realize this whole thing is great. WHAT the F#*%?!<br /><br />If it weren't bad enough that this annoyingly perfect child that absolutely everyone in the book ADORES exists, she is destined to be with JACOB. At the end of the book, Edward calls Jacob SON. I just shuddered again WRITING that. <br /><br />9) The climax, or lack thereof.<br />After several stupid and pointless pages, and GIANT letdowns with weak plotlines about secret messages and hidden motives that go nowhere, nothing happens. Bella puts up her magical, super-scary mental shield around everyone and all of a sudden the infinitely powerful and wizened vampire royalty runs away, peeing their pants. <br /><br />In conclusion, Breaking Down is not only literary trash that should have returned from the editor's office soaked in red ink, but it also completely destroys the story as a whole. It makes me sick to my stomach what this book did to Edward and Bella in my mind and everyone else's. I will never read a single page of this absolute rubbish again, and hopefully I'll forget about it in a few years. I pray this book will never make it into theaters. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.

Can I give it zero stars?
UGH. This whole series was a travesty really, but like any good masochist I plodded through. By the time I got to Breaking Dawn I knew I was in it just for the laughs but sadly, it failed in that department too. I can honestly say this is one of the few books in my life that I've literally had to refrain from throwing against the wall in sheer frustration. There are just so many things WRONG here that it's hard to sum them all up succinctly.<br /><br />Reasons why this thing almost ended up as wall fodder ( **warning, spoilers below**)<br /><br />1. Our heroine barely out of high school really REALLY wants to have sex with her sparkly boyfriend. Okay, whatever. There's a catch though. Sparkly boyfriend wants to wait until marriage. Bella doesn't want to get married, in fact the idea utterly repulses her. But sparkly boyfriend just won't let it go and our fearless heroine ends up "caving" because she really, really wants the sex that badly. The whole "engagement" scene amounts to Bella trying to jump him and getting denied, then accepting the ring with a lackluster "sigh....FINE. If that's what It takes to get laid then I'll do it. Give me the ring that I don't want to wear already, damn!!" Really Steph?? That's the best you can do for two people who are supposedly passionately in love?! Nice. <br /><br />2. Oh and screw college while you're at it. Because who needs an education when your ultimate goal in life is to marry a rich vampire and spend 24/7 with him. What a message to send to your target audience. <br /><br />3. The Pregnancy. This has to be the saddest excuse of pro-life propaganda disguised as sexy YA fiction ever. If that's your cup of tea then great, you'll really like the first half of this book. If not then be prepared for massive headaches caused by excessive eye-rolling. <br /><br />4. The Birth. I find it fascinating that the author tiptoes gently over the whole implied sex thing, yet goes above and beyond (wayyyy above and wayyyy beyond) to make sure the Miracle of Childbirth is depicted in a way that would make the makers of the Saw movie franchise proud. If the readers were expecting no less than a monster bloodaholic baby to come out of this romantic union, then this delivers (no pun intended). I will give Meyers credit in that she definitely has a promising future in the horror/scifi genre.<br /><br />5. A Dingo Ate My Baby? No honey, that's just the werewolf imprinting himself on the newborn. But the Cullens have more important things to worry about, like keeping Bella away from her newborn lest she find the Bundle of Joy appetizing. To her credit though Bella isn't exactly down with the whole imprinting thing at first. That is, until she realizes that having your kid get engaged to the family dog means a built-in babysitter and thus more time for sex with Edward. Awesome.<br /><br />6. Vampire p*ssing contest. What happens for the rest of the book is pretty much pointless, as the whole thing gears up to to be one big showdown that never amounts to anything. Basically the leaders of the vampire underworld, the Volturi, aren't down with Bellaward's freaky kid and plot to destroy them all. So the Cullens gather their frenemies to lead into battle Lord of the Rings style. Except the battle doesn't happen, except in Bella's and the Volturi leader's minds. Because now that Bella is a vamp she has super awesome magical powers like an invisible shield that she spreads over the frenemies to protect them from an equally freaky vampire that can make them pretend they are in pain. And then they all live happily ever after. Not joking.<br />

Just, wow.
At the time, I was 12, and I had seen Twilight in book stores hundreds of times. I had never paid it any attention until one day I finally decided to read it. I had read the back cover, but it wasn't too informative, but I did gather the fact that it was typically about vampire love. So, against my better judgment, I thought "Well, if I've seen it this many times it MUST be good." <br /><br />The beginning of Stephenie Meyer's writing leaves so much to be desired. In all of her books, for the first 150-200 pages I am bored out my mind, wishing for SOMETHING exciting to happen. I remember reading Twilight and being at least a hundred pages in and not caring about any of the characters at all. If they all decided to jump off a bridge I doubt I would have batted an eyelash. But then, something that changes the entire story occurs and it finally gets interesting 'till the point where I just can't put the book down. That is, until Breaking Dawn. I remember being at page 107, and looking at the 550-600 more pages I had to read and feeling like breaking down and crying. I wanted to chuck the book out the window and just have my friends fill me in on what happened, because I was just sick of it all. I had to force myself to read what I did, and every five minutes or so I got distracted by something around me because the book just couldn't hold my attention.<br /><br />In Twilight, I instantly liked Edward because of what I thought he'd be, but then later I realized I got his personality all wrong. I imagined he'd be . . . I don't know, different. Deep, meaningful, calm, cool, collected. Not some overactive stalker. (He said to her face that when she got to Forks he WATCHED her SLEEP. I mean, mega ew much?) Bella, I hardly had much of an opinion on until much later. She wasn't strong enough for me to respect, didn't have enough of a personality for me to like, and wasn't practical or smart enough for me to even comprehend. Her boyfriend was a freakin VAMPIRE, and she's totally fine with that. She wasn't terrified, or even the slightest bit nervous, which makes no sense. Think about it for a second: If your boyfriend is a VAMPIRE, would you be THAT cool about it? You wouldn't be scared at all, when a month ago the thought of a vampire existing would have you laughing at the absurdity? But here, Bella is introduced to a world of vampires and werewolves and she's pretty much chill with it all. <br /><br />Um, where's the conflict? Where's the "OMG YOU'RE A VAMPIRE?" Where's the "Ohmygoodnesswhatonearthisgoingon?" panic attack? Vampires and werewolves don't just waltz into everyday life and I expected at least SOME kind of resentment or hesitation Bella would have for Edward. But oh no, that would make too much sense.<br /><br />In New Moon, I had the slight hope that maybe through the course of the series Meyer would have Bella grow and develop into a strong, wonderful and mature character. Sadly, she didn't. To the very end, Bella remains a selfish, impractical, and illogical girl who for the life of me I can't stand. Jacob was the only one with a sliver of a complex personality. He had a goal and did everything in his power to achieve it, and throughout the books you saw the different faces of his personality. Everyone else's personality could just be classified with one or two descriptions. <br /><br />I won't even get into Eclipse, because I can never remember what it was about. <br /><br /><br />[Spoilers] <br /><br />Okay, from the beginning. What was with that wedding? The wedding was something I was actually EXCITED about. I thought "Oh, wow, I wonder how Alice is going to out due herself." Honestly, I don't even remember what anything looked like. Weren't the colors white and blue? That's probably wrong, but then again that's Stephenie Meyer's horrible descriptions at work. Most of the time I just imagine what everything and everyone looks like for myself. I didn't even KNOW Alice had spiky hair until the third book when Bella patted her head. "What? Alice has spiky hair? Since when?" And I didn't have a single clue as to what Jasper looked like besides that he had golden eyes and was blonde, and then after Bella becomes a vampire they mention his scars. Oh, and there's also the fact that Rosalie is gorgeous. Well, come on now, how descriptive is that? Gorgeous HOW? Like, pretty pretty model gorgeous? Or sophisticated gorgeous? Or seductress gorgeous? Meyer, come on girl, surely you can be more creative than just using vague descriptions about people. <br /><br />Now, the honeymoon was nice and all, something I thought she could have skipped until I saw the purpose it held. Bella gets pregnant! Oh joy! Oh hell. She's 19, and she gets pregnant. What kind of message was Stephenie Meyer trying to send to the young audience that reads her books? At least Edward had the decency to call Carlisle and assure Bella they would get Nessie out of her. (I am going to call her Nessie, because I think Renesmee is a hideous name and Meyer should be slapped for even considering it for the girl.) But what does Bella do? She stops him. She suddenly gets an overpowering sense of maternal instincts and wants to keep her baby. Bella didn't even really like children, and before then she never had the slightest thought about wanting one. But now, she's suddenly ready to die for this thing that's sucking the life out of her. In plain text, Bella isn't the motherly type. I wouldn't trust her to take care of my dog, let alone a baby. Isn't this the same Bella who did dangerous stunts to hear a voice in her head? Isn't this the same Bella who, on a whim, thought it was fine to jump off a cliff in a rainstorm? Being pregnant doesn't magically make you a mom, or magically make you mature. It makes you utterly terrified. No matter whom you are or how old, for any woman who gets pregnant, her first instinct is to have her mom there at all times. But does Bella call Renee? Nope, she calls Rosalie. ROSALIE, PEOPLE. That makes SO much sense. <br /><br />Another point about Nessie: Wasn't she just the PERFECT baby? I mean, she was disgustingly perfect. I mean, when at all did Bella ever show any true motherly characteristics? I was surprised at Meyer, because she actually does have children, and I wondered what she was thinking when she wrote about Nessie. When did Bella ever feel the horrible strain that comes with taking care of a baby? Nessie was way too perfect. There was no constant feedings every two hours, there was no changing diaper after diaper, there was no shopping for baby clothes and supplies, there was no Nessie waking up at 3 AM and crying - which was a surprise, considering the head-board destroying sex Bella and Edward have every night. You'd think it would wake her up - and there was not much of anything. The only time Nessie cried was when she wanted Bella, which I thought was just plain ridiculous. (So what, she never wanted Edward?) Now, I understand that sometimes there IS such a thing as a quiet baby. I was one myself, and I never cried unless something was wrong with me, but there is no baby that just doesn't cry at all unless it wants its mom. That just doesn't happen. (Did anyone else feel Alice's statement that Nessie had never been set down in her life laughable? When I read that, I didn't know whether to fall out my chair laughing or give myself a face-palm and chuck the book into the dirt where it belonged. Honestly, I was surprised Nessie could even walk.)  <br /><br /><br />May we move on to Jacob's point of view? I thought it was going to be, like, Jacob traveling the world from Canada to Mexico to South America to Greece and such on a spiritual journey to find himself and realize that he really, really didn't need Bella. But again, I was wrong and expected too much. No, instead he hangs around Forks, determined to stay with Bella until she has her monster baby and they turn her into a vampire. Oh, but there's a solution! They can abort the baby, and then Jacob can have a baby with Bella the NORMAL way, so Bella can still have a child. Btw, this was Edward's idea. Btw, Jacob agreed. <br /><br />Ew, much. Ew on so many levels. <br /><br />But I guess Bella isn't THAT sick because he didn't agree. One of the smartest moves she's made this whole series. <br /><br /><br />Another thing, I hated how Bella skipped the newborn stage. I was actually excited about that, wishing, praying that Bella would turn evil and start killing off humans. Wouldn't that be so interesting?! Her, the heroine, suddenly becoming the evil villain, using her vampire powers for her evil deeds. And wouldn't it have been beautiful if the Cullens and Blacks and Volturi and whatnot had to, oh goodness, KILL her to preserve the secret and save humanity? I would have loved Meyer if anything remotely relating to that had happened. But, as I've learned, I always expect this woman to redeem herself and the whole series be worthwhile, only to be continually disappointed. <br />     <br />So, why did Bella skip the newborn stage? Oh right, because it was her state of mind. She didn't WANT to be one, therefore she WASN'T. Because Bella is SPESHUL, therefore she can DEFY the natural laws Meyer has set up. But since Meyer just wants all her characters to be happy, even if it means doing so in the most illogical ways, she decided to have the most sugar-coated fairytale ending I'd ever read in my life that wasn't in picture book. <br /><br />So, Bella gets everything she wants, including Edward, a baby, a family, immortality and tons and tons of sex? Check. Jacob has someone, even though she's 2 months old and it makes him a pedo? Check. The Volturi are defeated without actually engaging them in battle, causing the most depressing let-down in the history of potential battle scenes ever? Check. Sugar cakes and muffins and gummy bears rain from a glittering sky and Carebears run frolicking through the meadows of innocence as the final ending? Check. Well, well, Meyer, you've outdone yourself if I do say so myself. <br />

Poorly written and vastly overestimated
Okay, I'm not going to lie: I am addicted to Twilight.  I own actual, physical copies of the first three books and the copy of Breaking Dawn I ordered from Amazon is on the way (I read an online version).  But I really cannot understand why anyone, ANYONE, can treat it seriously.  The entire series is filled with convenient plot devices, shallow, one-dimensional characters, and Meyer is not a very concise writer, which means that the books are long.  Really long.<br /><br />I'll admit the initial plot is engaging: deadly yet benevolent vampires, a forbidden love.  All very marketable and appealing.  What bothers me is the lack of skill with which the stories are executed.  Meyer's writing is not bad, it's just amateurish.  Quite honestly, I think I or any other of my friends could have written it the way she had, and I'm not even out of high school.  Everything in Breaking Dawn slots neatly into place, making all the fuss that precluded it practically useless.  What was the point of building all that up if it's just going to resolve it anyway?<br /><br />I hear people comparing her series to Harry Potter and Pride and Prejudice, and wince.  I sincerely hope that the masses don't feel this way, or else I'll lose faith in society's ability to judge quality forever.

Boring, fails to use logic. Lacks in character interest.
Okay, I know I'm probably going to get comments over me saying that the book has no logic.  Yes I am well aware that the whole series based around the fantasy of vampires and werewolves etcetera. I can't get past the fact that Stephenie Meyer broke the rules of her own world while writting this novel.  Numerous times in interviews she has stated that it is impossible for her vampires to have children, and that once turned into a vampire all of their bodily fluids are replaced by venom. <br /><br />As reading this book I felt like all the elements circulated through the other three novels were thrown out the window, the characters for the most part were boring, Edward lost his charm, Bella went from being obsessed with Edward to obsessed with their child, and Rosalie flipped into a motherly role that just seemed out of place (I know Rosalie's backstory and that she wanted to have children, I understand the way SMeyer was probably trying to go with getting Rosalie involved).  If SMeyer was going to get Rosalie put into this motherly role then where was Esme?  Last time I checked she had a yearn to bear her own children as well. As an author, SMeyer developed a seemingly okay plotline but just didn't expand on it enough.  It felt as though it was rushed in the end. <br /><br />The "explanation" of how Bella got pregnant was also put to fault later in the novel, when a Amazonian vampire explains how his father is trying to create a superior race by impregnating human females with his children.  How would this even be possible if, when using SMeyer's logic.  She explains that Edward was able to get Bella pregnant was because he was a virgin and that he still had sperm in his system from when he was turned 100+ years ago. With that said, vampire males couldn't create more sperm, so how could this Amazonian vampire keep going around and impregnating human females?<br /><br />After the birth of "Nessie" the book took a downward spiral and was nothing more than a borefest, everything just seemed to happen without any conflict whatsoever.  Bella easily shifted into vampire life without any problems, she was able to care for her baby, keep her friendship with Jacob, and even was able to "slightly" let Charlie in on her secret. Even at the end of the story, we are led up to believe that there is going to be a fight between the Volturi and the Cullen coven along with other covens who agreed to support their cause.  What you think is going to be a fight just turns into pages and pages of endless drabble between the Volturi and members of the Cullens' defensive, and in the end lead Volturi member Aro agrees to let them be and he leads the rest of the Volturi on their way, so Bella and Edward could now begin their "happily ever after."  Where in the last pages Bella finally allows Edward to see inside her mind, one of the features that drew him towards he at the beginning of Twilight. <br /><br />What disappoints me the most is that this novel had potential, it seems to me that in anything SMeyer writes she has a generally good idea but can never expand on it.  Breaking Dawn seems to me as though it was completely rushed, and that she just finished writing it because she had to. Not to mention I am curious as to what happened to the editors in this book.  Has SMeyer ever heard of a thesaurus?  I have never seen an author overuse the words "chagrin" and "dazzle" as much as she does.  I am honestly curious as to how any editor would allow the sentence "He was both dazzling and dazzled" be put into print. <br /><br />Lastly, I find it really sad that there are so many people giving this a five-star review just because it is a SMeyer novel.  Yes, it is nice to have loyalty but please a poorly written book is still a poorly written book no matter who writes it.

And she would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling IQs above 40.
So, I guess that consistency, logic and entertainment were out of the question, then?<br /><br />  I was never a rabid fan of this series. Seriously. Why? Because, let's be honest, they're not, and never were, well-written. It has always felt like a fan fiction to me. The way the books are written in first person, the way the main character is proclaimed to be (not really ever BEING it, though) and the way every single character acts around her, always made me feel like an intruder in Stephenie Meyer's deep wet fantasies. And yes, I noticed. I noticed how you were supposed to insert yourself in Isabella's shoes (ahah!) to make it your OWN fantasy. Durr, I see what you did thar!!  <br /> <br />  "Why did you read it then, stoopid?" - you might ask.<br />  Well, I might answer, though they were never the great books they were hyped out to be, and Meyer still isn't the best writer evah (not even the greatest storyteller, in my opinion) and these series is not (or should not be) best-selling material, they were fairly entertaining. They were simple, entertaining, simple and entertaining. That's it. A good escape read. So yes, I kept reading them; if only so that I could get some closure on the story and the complete set of the series (I hate incomplete series on my bookshelf). <br /><br />  My opinion never changed, though. It only grew stronger and became more and more confirmed by Meyer herself with each new book. I don't hate the author. I just don't think she deserves this much attention. I mean it. Her writing doesn't even sound to me as a college literature graduated one. These books are only successful because a LOT of teenage girls and bored housewives lived through Meyer's fantasy as their own: a simple, regular girl (*ahem* you!) draws the attention of hot, mysterious, popular and rich guy. Not only that but she's the ONLY one he ever got interested in (in 107 years! Really?! Talk about dead hormones and some serious sex issues!) AND everyone seems to love you AND you get some action in your life, during which you can play damsel in distress (over and over and over and over again!) and be saved by hot guy, ALWAYS. YAY! Fantasy fulfilling time! <br /><br />  Twilight was, when compared to the others, good. The best of the series, I think. Maybe that's because it is the beginning and as so, it didn't ask so much for all those pesky things like: consistent characterization, character development and continuity. Then, the other books needed it much more. Oh noes! New Moon was bo-ring. And honestly, annoying. With all the Romeo and Juliet pseudo-crap! Bella showed herself as being even weaker, needier, dumber and more pathetic than previously. I don't think I ever saw a character go back in development before but, alas, she did. And Edward too. I didn't find it endearing that he tried to kill himself. Nor did I find attractive that Jacob was all around the place moping for Bella. Can you spell pathetic? As in, the most pathetic, needy and weak characters' cast in the history of ever? Eclipse just accentuated that so much more. Is there anyone with a personality in here, somewhere? And a strong one at that? Why can't, any of the main three characters, really stand up for themselves (and for the right reasons), grow a spine and stop being so damn miserable? Why can't they just grow and be strong and go away from what's hurting them? These characters and their interactions with each other remind more of a bunch of drug addicts and their drugs. Because Meyer's characters are addicted to each other.<br /><br />  Breaking Dawn just delved deeper and deeper into the waters of mediocrity. Its continuity with the other books is zero. Everything that produced even the tiniest spark of thought in my brain on the other books was totally erased, stepped on and vomited by Bella in this thing. Serves me right for trying to think at all about the previous themes of choice, sacrifice and consequence. How dare I, trying to take something actually meaningful from this series...<br /><br />  Breaking Dawn was worse because it made me laugh when I don't think I was supposed to. Also, it reached new degrees of disgusting, all in the wrong places. It was so uninteresting; it was painful to read sometimes. Never before had I ever had to force myself to keep turning pages. It was also way too long. How can anyone say so much about nothing, I will never know. I seriously doubt this was edited at all. Heck, I almost doubt even Meyer herself read it more than once. Grammatical mistakes, bad and sloppy writing, obvious OOCness, all mistakes that can NOT be in a best selling product. Heavy chunks and entire sections could and should be erased. My biologist's heart weeps for all those poor innocent trees. IF an editor looked at this thing I would like to meet this person and ask him/her what the hell...?! And also what were you high on, because it must be good. <br /><br />It's the final book in a best-selling series, yet it's extremely and amazingly amateurish. All the bad choices were taken. Not to mention that it's a YA romance novel that it's neither YA nor romantic. Meyer says she never wrote a YA book in her life. Really?? Well, my darling, then either you're not the one writing this or someone doesn't know what the hell they're doing. Because they are being sold as much, so you have to write to YA. Not the case with this book.<br /><br />The Positive:<br /><br />-Leah and Seth ruled! They were fun and interesting and had a personality.<br />-Jacob also ruled until the sad, sad end.<br />-Jacob's chapter titles actually made me smile.<br />-The final scene with Edward and Bella because it was the only shadow of romance and the only bit in the entire lengthy book where they were like their previous selves. AND maybe by entering her mind Eddie will finally understand how boring Bella is. Take that, Edwarckle! Yeah, I had to put up with that for four books! And you'll have to put up with her for eternity! Ahah! Not to mention it was the final scene!<br /><br />The Negative:<br /><br />-Everything freaking else.<br /><br />Now, on to the marvellous piece of WTF known as "plot". <br /><br />The wedding was... meh. Short, uninspired and under described. <br />The honeymoon was an unsexy joke. I did stop finding it funny when she started begging for sex. Way to go Bells, I guess dignity isn't in your dictionary. And the sex was... also meh. THAT was what everyone's been waiting for?! Thanks, Steph, I could barely contain myself with all the burning passion, desire and sensuality of that. When childish kisses and innocent holding are more sensual than the actual making of the love, you know you are in for one long crappy romance. <br /><br />The pregnancy was the biggest ridiculousness in the entire life of ridiculous. OMFGWTF?! I don't even care about the impossibility of it all, but as soon as she started with all the chromosomal mumbo-jumbo, a lonely tear of anger made its way out of my biologist's eye. It was sad, all that ignorance. Leave science out of it, damn it! Darwin actually rolled on his deathbed. <br />Jacob's book was a bunch of wah wah wah wah wah wah, but as I already noted, Leah and Seth were cool. I was annoyed that Jake had to go back to selfish Bella and more so with Edward just giving her away for sex. Well, I guess I would want to give her away too. But I actually enjoyed understanding Jacob better because he was cool (until the sad, sad end) and I love his sarcasm! I don't love that he loves Beauty Swan. I wish Leah would've smashed the crap out of her instead of just making her cry, but oh well. I was rooting and cheering for Leah all the way! Seriously, it was about time that someone told Bella how lame and selfish and unbearable she is.<br /><br />  Now, the birth scene. Can you say YUCK? I actually felt nauseated! Gross! Was that really necessary? Oh, and the ripping uterus with teeth thing? So romantic! Way to go, Meyer, you destroyed the last shred of hotness that Edwarckle might've still had at this point. Eww! "Fountain of blood" ... I was prepared to vomit a fountain of actual vomit! And then, after all that, we're supposed to just love cutey pie Renesmee?! She's NOT adorable, she's freaky and creepy. Oh, and the loving scene when a mother holds her child in her arms for the first time? Nope, the creepo mutant alien thingy just bite her! Oh, predator, where are you?<br /><br />The transformation was a disappointment. The vampire Bella was a disappointment. Of course she is the most beautiful, graceful, controlled, perfect vampire ever! Wow, Steph, another opportunity for character development completely destroyed. The transformation and the newborn phase, had they been made correctly, could've been a great time for struggle and pain and development of depth to both Bella and Edward alone, not to mention it was perfect to mature and take their relationship to a higher level of depth and connection. But, no. Just throw that away! The only thing that was done was make Bella even more annoying and perfect. Oh, and of course she had to have a power. A lame one, but still. Was I the only one waiting for a romantic, passionate but still difficult scene between Edward and Bella? One when he would actually bite her?<br />Oh, and the motherly and fatherly vibes that I got from Renesfreaky's parents were just amazing. I wish Edward and Bella would adopt me so I could be conveniently passed on to Rosalie and Jacob whenever they wanted to get it on - vampire style!<br /><br />The imprinting ... God! I don't even want to go there. Again, another opportunity for growth and development for Jacob completely raped and chewed on. Wouldn't it be great if he just resisted the imprinting crap thing? And actually fell in love? Remember all his talk about not wanting to give up on his free will? Yeah, she basically just stepped over it, shred it to pieces and set it on fire. Because, you know, who wants to have freedom, anyway? Not to mention how severely disturbing it is that he imprinted on the child of his former target of obsession. AND the fact that the thing is still an infant. Well, he's just going to have to raise it until it's ready! ARGH!  <br /><br />The new vampires were more of the same wah wah wah. And useless one, for that matter. <br />The battle was the most epic non-battle that I have ever not-read. It was just disappointing. I only wanted for someone to die (and, please, Irina-whoever does NOT count)! Or at least suffer a little bit! God forbid, Stephenie, God forbid there's actually some sacrifice or pain or struggle. It was lame and *yawn*. <br />The cheesy happy ending was the saddest of all happy endings ever. Yes, absolutely EVERYONE got EVERYTHING without giving up ANYTHING. No one deserved it. No one. It was all so sparkly and happy, with rainbows and unicorns, all so sweet and candy that I think I got diabetes by just reading it.<br /><br />Now, the characters. Are you expecting to find any of the ones you met in the earlier books? Well, stop deceiving yourself, because you are not going to find them here. They're simply gone. <br /><br />Bella has got to be the most annoying main character ever. And I refuse to use the word "heroine" because she just isn't. She's whiny; she's selfish, immature and embarrassingly weak and needy. I just can't understand why everyone, including Edward and Jacob, love her so much. It's amazing, though, that without many qualities and so many faults she still manages to be the perfect Mary-Sue. She's the sparkliest, most beautiful, perfect and most special and purest snowflake you can find. If sparkly, beautiful, perfect, special and pure snowflakes had a name it would be Bella. For now on, every time it snows, I'll just call it "snowbells". It makes me sick.<br /><br />Edward was reduced to a pathetic shell of self hatred, hidden in a pool of his own miserable impossible tears. Not sexy, at all! Maybe it's just my Latin-Oriental roots talking, but really, cold and hard marble who just weeps in misery without stepping up and taking action just isn't my type. I don't want a man who just gives me what I want blindly and gives in to my every whim; I want one who can give me what I NEED and who can step up against me when necessary. Well, I guess I just find strong personalities hotter, it's a matter of taste.  <br /><br />Jacob was the ONLY developed character in this series. He actually had a personality, and a fun one! Ironically, he's the one character that Meyer wasn't planning on developing. Whoops! Well, he got butchered on the end with the imprinting thing and is now stuck to Bella and Renespooky for eternity so... I guess he got what he deserved for having depth.<br /><br />Renesmee... I think we're supposed to love her. Aren't we? I just love mutant babies that grow with repulsing speed, are born with teeth, chew their way out of mommy, drink blood and read. Such cuties. Again, I cannot understand why everyone loves her so damn much. I guess the Sueish gene runs in the family. She got that from her mommy.<br /><br />Leah and Seth were awesome. Too bad they were not even considered for development. Leah just... well, stayed there, I guess. She was developing a good, real relationship with Jacob but then ... Puff! Sucks to be you, Leah! Maybe if Meyer had inserted herself in your shoes she wouldn't have to do this.<br /><br />The Cullens weren't there. Period. And when they were, they were so out of character it actually gave me physical pain. I don't even remember reading Esme's name, except in that idiot island's one.<br /><br />The humans are just GONE. Minus Charlie, but after what she did to him, I wish she would've just lost him somewhere like she did to Renee, Jessica, Angela, Mike and Ben. Because, you know, humans just aren't good enough to be in this dazzling book.<br /><br />The Vulturi ... Oh Mother of God. <br /><br />In conclusion, it was a mess. A big, sloppy, illogical, unprofessional, uninteresting and unedited mess. I won't even go into all the messages and innuendos out there because honestly I don't even know if she understands them herself. And I'm tired of talking about this.<br /><br />Read it if you must, but borrow from someone or get it from the library. <br /><br />I am sorry for the lengthy review but hey, Meyer does it lengthy - ALWAYS - and somehow it seems to be working for her.           <br />      <br />

Read the first book, forget the rest
Others have already written reviews that express my thoughts on this book far more eloquently than I could hope to.  However, my reaction to this book was so strong and overwhelming that I nonetheless felt compelled to add my own comments.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed reading the first book in the Twilight series.  The writing may not have been polished and the plot slightly ill-paced, but these flaws were outweighed by the tender depiction of a first romance, replete with the angst, wonderment and intensity that accompanies teenage affections.  <br /><br />Having had such a strong positive reaction to the first book, I rushed out to buy the 3 sequels, desperate for another fix.  Much to my dismay, the more I read the more my initial positive reactions started to be eroded by new negative reactions.  With each successive book, the writing became sloppier and more rambling.  The characters started to become more one-dimensional, and to frequently act out of character.  The plots became less believable and less purposeful, with the story rambling in pointless circles.  Still, I persevered.<br /><br />And then I started to read Breaking Dawn. <br /><br />It has been a long time since a book filled me with such absolute revulsion as this one did.<br />  <br />The writing is horrible and makes you wonder whether S. Meyer's editor even bothered reading the book before sending it off to print.<br /><br />The plot is simply ludicrous and left me reeling with disgust at the total lack of consistency with the previous books and the complete inappropriateness of some plot elements.  Vampires able to father half-human babies?  Demon spawn tearing their mothers open as they are birthed?  A 17 year old werewolf falling in love with a newborn baby?  (Has anyone tested the water supply near S. Meyer's house to check the levels of lead?)<br /><br />Most heart-breaking of all, though, was the way S. Meyer absolutely decimated her characters in this final chronicle.  Bella was slightly irritating in Twilight and became more aggravating in New Moon and Eclipse, but by Breaking Dawn she had become unforgivingly shallow and stupid.  Even peripheral characters have started acting oddly, such as Charlie who suddenly accepts the fact that something isn't normal about his daughter(including the fact that in the space of 3 months she has acquired her own daughter) but is happy just to hang around without asking questions.<br /><br />Most unforgiveable and disturbing was Edward's treatment.  In Twilight, Edward was brooding, intense and alluring but still soft and caring.  By Breaking Dawn, he has become nothing more than a cardboard character who can do nothing much other than sit by his wife's side giving in to her every demand (possibly having been numbed by spending so much time with such a shallow creature).  <br /><br />I never made it to the end of this book.  I lasted until a few pages after Bella had become a vampire, and then simply couldn't read any further, such was my total disgust.<br /><br />The upshot?  Read the first book in the series, Twilight, and enjoy it for what it is - a simple, unpolished, but warm story of teenage romance.  But stop there and save yourself the angst and pain of reading the 3 sequels.

I want my time and money back
Ok first let me say that I am 22 just to get that out of the way. Well I started reading the twilight series because as a hugeee fan of harry potter, a lot of the fandom was directing towards twilight so I decided to begin a new series. I am also a huge fan of vampires, so I didnt think the series could be a let down for me. So when I read Twilight for the first time I was slightly intrigued, I didnt love the book but didnt hate it so I moved on to New Moon and for some reason I loved New Moon, then continued to Eclipse, but wasnt too thrilled with it. Then that was that like everyone else I was excited for the 4th installment (I was probably more excited about waiting for the book to come out than the actual book itself). Well to make a long story short, I reread the series right before Breaking Dawn was released and realized that i absolutely hated it! I regretted ever reading it because I had probably been so hyped about reading the series that I didnt realize how amazingly childish and nonsensical the whole plot line was, but now it was pointless to not read the last installment.<br /><br />So now that I've read Breaking Dawn, all I can say is I WANT MY MONEY BACK!! what was this author thinking!! the point when Bella becomes pregnant i just literally laughed and threw my book and realized the whole thing was a joke! how more ridiculous can she get, and then on top of that the way stephanie ruined Jacob's character, I cant believe it!! He was my favorite character and it went from being a strong one to just being like a sidekick for comic relief. I totally agree with what everyone is saying about the book sending out the wrong message to young girls, which is that the perfect life includes meeting an obsessive boyfriend marrying him and then having his baby, and forgetting about your family and your future just to be with this one guy! HELLO HOW RIDICULOUS CAN THAT GET! anywho I plan on returning the book as soon as I can and for gods sake<br /><br />PLEASE STOP COMPARING THIS TO HARRY POTTER!!! it doesnt even reach up to the standards and when I have kids ina  far future this is one book I will not allow them to read because of its absurd message and overall bad writing!

Contrived and Artificially Elongated
Stephenie Meyer's ideas aren't necessarily the problem -it's her writing. Not only has Meyer failed to expand her vocabulary to prevent using the same adjectives continually, but she continues to construct meaningless conversations between characters that doesn't progress the plot in any shape or form. These meaningless and shallow conversations continue for a couple of hundred pages indicating that perhaps most of this novel is padding as the author is slightly lost at sea without quite knowing how to construct a novel. This is nothing unusual as Meyer has struggled with plot and pacing throughout her previous novels but never to this dire extent. In Meyer tradition most of the novel is taken up by irrelevant conversations and a day-by-day description of what the characters have been doing. These conversations involve characters doing a lot of whispering, laughing and chuckling at every comment - even the serious ones, and describing the colour of everyones eyes continually. Similarly to her previous works, the real plot begins to unfold during the last few chapters and if you blink, you will essentially miss it. <br /><br />	There were some good ideas here, although none are original ones. Renesmee could really have been developed further and could have been quite a complex character who is both good but with vicious tendencies. The difficulty I had was with characterisation. I can see how both Bella and Edward are simple archetypes in which adolescent girls can project themselves. The difficulty is that Bella's simple characterisation here is not consistent with her previous behaviour. In fact, none of the characters behave in concordance with their previously established views. Bella quickly changes her mind about marriage and motherhood without any reason whatsoever. She is willing to die for a hybrid human-vampire child that is killing her and in which she has no chance of survival unless she becomes immortal. Similarly her father doesnt want to know anything about vampirism or what has happened to his daughter and basically is unconcerned about her wellbeing. If I was turned into part of the un-dead legion, I'm sure my family would notice and be more than a little concerned! Bella's mother who was previously against the idea of marriage at a young age becomes an advocate for it and Edward, who was unable to procreate since he has no fluid sires a child. Meyer shows a fundamental lack of writing ability as she contradicts her previous works and changes her own universe simply because it suits her to do so. This is not the work of a thoughtful and talented author who overcomes character constraints with creativity and forethought. Throughout the novel Meyer never allows the reader to forget they are reading a piece of fiction. You can almost visualise strings attached to each character as Meyer manipulates them as she chooses on a whim. <br /><br />	My biggest difficulty with the novel was with Jacob imprinting on the child Renesmee. I am not comfortable with an adult character deciding that an infant child will grow up to become their sexual mate. What shocks me is they these children who are 'imprinted' don't have a choice in the matter. Jacob obsessively carries Renesmee everywhere, becomes jealous when her own mother holds her and cannot bear to be apart from the toddler. Somehow this doesnt sit well with me. Although the appeal of Twilight, for me, has always been that the characters are so dysfunctional and exacerbate their own problems that it borders on the amusing, imprinting verges on the obscene. I dont think Meyer is quite aware how co-dependent, psychologically troubled and dysfunctional her characters are. What makes this worse is that Meyer seems genuinely unaware she has created characters who are so unwell. If Meyer did not intentionally create them to be examples of obsession and pathological dependence then she needs to work on characterisation and narrative extensively so she is better able to construct character according to her own designs.  <br /><br />	Although the previous novels in the Twilight saga were simply fun, trashy novels by an amateur who was able to tap a market, Breaking Dawn is an embarrassment. It lacks solid characterisation, structure, contradicts previously established continuity, and has a myriad of plot pacing issues. Not all of this should be attributed to Meyer as the editor certainly has a role to assist. <br />

A senseless end to an over-praised series
I read Twilight and hated it, but since my friend loaned me the entire series, I decided to be as fair as possible and read the set. Wow. With specific regards to this particular installment, I can't say I was disappointed because my expectations were abominably low, but I was nevertheless surprised. It didn't seem to fit. Whereas Bella was whiny, obsessive, rather stupid, and really quite selfish and mean in the way she treated everyone but Edward (the first 3 installments), she finally developed some redeeming qualities in this book. All she had to do was become a vampire. Unfortunately, these qualities were so utterly out of character that I had a hard time believing any of it. Suddenly the incomprehensible klutz was graceful "even for a vampire." Her, um, "passions" were raging out of control, except the ones that should have been raging out of control (aka blood lust). She had an unusual and never explained sense of control over those passions, which doesn't fit the girl who was put in a catatonic state because her high school obsession of a couple months dumped her; the very same that fainted at a drop of blood and held her "splitting sides" in when she thought about Edward. She epitomized an obsessive lack of control over the mind, much less her ever-imperiled body. She was able to pick up on and figure out clues much too quickly for someone so dense, and yet other times, she was stupider than ever ("what? my immunity from other vampires is a gift? slow down, I don't understand..."). I won't linger on the absolute absurdity of Meyer's feigned science (the terrible miscalcuations in Bella's gestation... if 1 day= 2 weeks, she should have delivered by the time she found out she was pregnant; the chromosomal incompatibilities, the fact that love-making itself requires circulation, or the fact that even making sperm is still a cyclic, ongoing process that a vampire stuck in time should not have been able to accomplish). I will say that dragging Dr. Cullen's scientific musings into the story only pulled me further out of the magic and pointed out the ludicrousness of each assertion.  The largest problem with this book is that it was... boring. Nothing really happened. There was never any real fear of Bella not surviving childbirth, especially when there were still hundreds of pages left to go. The fight with the Volturi was tediously built up with such an anti-climatic resolution that I felt I'd waded through hundreds of pointless pages to get to nothing. Somebody (many) should have died, but nobody of consequence did, and I knew while reading that Meyer wouldn't have the stomach to do it, which further reduced any suspense. The way that Bella abused Jacob was abominable, and the clean (?), simple, resolution to that, void of any consequence, felt disingenuous. In short, everything was wrapped up and presented with a bow on top, and it severely hampered the book. There was no real growth in Bella- she went from being pointlessly useless with no other aspirations in life than to have sex with Edward and become a vampire, to miraculously saving the day for everyone. All of this came at absolutely no cost or sacrifice to anyone; everything worked out even better than hoped for. I realize this is a YA novel, and maybe that's what Meyer was going for: young teens will read this and see that you can have your cake and eat it too, and here are some sprinkles for that cake and may I get you a glass of milk? Be irresponsible, sluff off school, let your boyfriend sleep over every night, lie to your parents, do as many stupid things as humanly possible, treat your friends like crap, and not only will everything work out for you, but one day you'll just magically wake up a gorgeous, mature, talented and wise adult with everything you ever hoped for. Truly, this is a fairy tale.

How did this get past her editor?
First of all, how could this book be written by the same author we all came to know and love in the first 3 books? Second of all, how could her editor, her friends and family, and anyone else who read this book before it was published ENCOURAGE this disaster? <br /><br />I was up until 6 in the morning reading this book hoping and praying that somewhere it would say "just Kidding...now here's the real book" or "and then Bella woke up from that horrible nightmare".  <br /><br />Did Meyer not realize that the relationship between Edward and Bella was the reason for the success of the first three books? There was no hint of that relationship anywhere in the book.<br /><br />The Jacob imprinting sub-plot? I didn't think that Meyer would cop-out like that.  I thought he'd find someone that would help him learn to live without Bella (and the whole first half of the book things seemed to be going in that direction-Leah could help him get over Bella, and he could help her get over Sam, Meyer isn't a cop out-win, win, win!).  <br /><br />Most importantly, this series was supposed to be written for young adults (and judging by the release party I attended last night, that is a stretch, I took my middle-school aged sister and her friend and that seemed to be the main age group in attendance).  Young adults can sympathize with first love.  The love between a mother and a child? Leave that to the Lifetime Original Movies.   <br /><br />If you haven't already, do NOT read.  Convince yourself that the series ended with Eclipse, and let your imagination run wild for what happens next (for it won't run any wilder than Meyers).  And let's have a moment of silence for a short but brillant writing career that will never fully recover.

If you don't have something to nice say, say it anyway it may spare another!!!
I really liked Twilight (never as good as any of the HPs, but it was a good book), but after New Moon I knew I would hate the rest of the series-- and I do! I hope Meyers would fix all the problems in her storyline, but it seems her mind- at least in writing this series is as weak and flawed as her characters! I suppose it all was just a weak rip off of Wuthering Heights and Romeo and Juliet, but it lacks enough back-story to allow the reader to understand why so many of the characters are so pathetic, especially the main character, Isabella. You'll end up not liking her more so than sympathizing with her, and her man, Edward goes from being the sharp, keen type, to a pillar to hold up the asinine Bella.<br /><br />**Series Recap**<br /><br />Bella is totally pathetic, she's a weak, selfish, flimsy woman. She falls for the VAMPIRE WHO TRIES TO NO AVAIL TO CONVINCE HER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. He leaves her to protect her, but she will only allow herself to believe he left because she is so worthless! (Which, as the series goes on, you may believe she is.) Through the series Bella laments time and time again, how unworthy she is, and constantly has some man to remind her of her importance! If you have a daughter with any kind of self-esteem issue PLEASE KEEP THESE BOOKS AWAY FROM HER!! Bella uses the young and innocent Native American (Jacob) as a crutch to survive her depression. She knows he loves her but won't deny herself the relief she gets from presence even though she knows she her only love is the vampire (Edward).<br /><br />Jacob risks his life time and time again to protect her, he's called to duty in the first place because of her relationship with Edward. Despite all Jacob gives to Bella as soon as Edward needs her she tosses Jacob to the side to rescue Edward. When Edward vows to never leave her again, she more or less forgets Jacob, there are some extenuating circumstances but still she does not put up the fight for him that she put up to have Edward in her life. She disrespects her father, lies to her mother, and does all the things that would break any parent's heart to be with the vampire, and no matter how much she'll think of her poor parents, they're always some kind of afterthought. Granted, in the first book she tries to save her mom, but you'll soon see, if confronted with the idea of leaving Edward to spare them, she'll leave them to have Edward.<br /><br />Bella refuses to accept that she cannot have both Edward and Jacob as they are mortal enemies, she's determined to have things her way and actually feels like Jacob is wrong for not giving her what she wants, which is to be her best friend while she loves the vampire...to make matter worse Jacob's people have always existed to protect mankind, while Edward is just an oddity who no-longer tries to destroy humanity. <br /><br />Through the series Bella causes trouble time and time again, but is always rescued. She never develops any self-esteem or any ability to take care of herself. At one point, she actually risks her life just to have delusions of Edward. She doesn't care about how her parents, or Jacob, who she uses to help induce these hallucinations, would feel if she died. She doesn't even care that she could be risking Jacob's life too! She abandons her friends and her family to be with Edward, who never really requested that of her. Edward has to fight with her to attend college, he has to beg her to have a normal human but she desires nothing more than to give it all up. She fears marrying Edward, but is dying to give up her soul to be a vampire; she at one point rationalizes that if she were a vampire, Edward would never want to leave her again...does that make any sense? Her value relies on rather or not a man- a vampire wants her, a horrible self-esteem lesson for every young girl, in a world where you hear of the abuse against women almost daily! A woman fought to be present, while books such as these teach young adult woman, a man is the beginning and ending of existence. I know it's a fantasy book, but books are meant as educational tools in one way or another. In Harry Potter the message is persistence, faith and overcoming, in Wuthering Heights it's a lesson on karma, and to do unto others etc...<br /><br />Meyers gave her characters a happy ending they didn't deserve--and if they did deserve it, it's never explained why they did. She uses four pages, every time she mentions Edwards's name to explain his beauty, but practically never explains why he'd crave human love. Simply because he's a vampire isn't enough, because there are plenty of other vampires who get along fine, without love. Is it because he's lonely? She doesn't explain it, but in a way that's too bad too, if he were truly interested in Bella's well being and enjoying what he missed out on--a life. His actions however clearly show that's not the case either, so what? Is he just selfish? Hardly the kind of character you'd want to have a happy ending.<br /><br />In the end she marries Edward, coaxes him into sex, gets pregnant which according to Meyers own outline should have been impossible. She's a young mom, who must hide the dramatic time from her own mother, who she professes to love so very much. She has the kid, and accepts and expects Jacob to protect it, but then gets angry when he does so the best way he knows how. Never mind the fact, that he is still in love with her, she's inconsiderate! She won't have him, but won't let him go either! And finally Bella and Edward live happily ever after!<br /><br />It's a sick, sick series! You wouldn't know it by the first book, you'd believe it's a coming of age thing, that Bella will mature, and that you will see her relationship with Edward and Jacob actually gain some substance. Through the series, you're never given any actual reason for the love, not between Ed and Bella or between Jake and Bella. With Edward especially is seems more like lust or some kind of spell, because all she can ever talk about his how handsome, beautifully angelic he is and how his smell makes her forget her thoughts, how his breath lulls her to sleep-- total nonsense.<br /><br />I know a love story is dramatic, heart wrenching, and usually someone gets jilted, but she takes it to a mental level. It should have some practical basis, or some redeeming qualities. It should make you believe in it, or admire something about it. In the case of The Meyers Series, all she gives you is a self-centered teenage girl who is incapable of not only taking care of herself, but Bella can't even spare others her destruction because she chooses not to. It also sends the message that all little girls need in life, is a man and a baby, and I've wondered if that comes from Meyer's Mormon upbringing? I do not mean to insult any religion, and I do not know anything about Meyers other than what I've read, but this series she's created is truly horrific. It exemplifies some sort of misogynistic idea; women, Bella is clearly the weaker, albeit more manipulative sex.<br /><br />Spare yourself the trouble, read something else. I usually don't write reviews but this series was so idiotic that I had to say something. I know it's just a book and I know it's a fantasy, but just as we try to hold TV and music responsible for the messages, they send to the youth we must do the same with what our children read. It's problem enough to talk about losing your soul, it's another to happily give it up, but when you add in destructiveness, selfishness, mental illness in the form of self-esteem issues, you have a serious problem that doesn't need to be shared.<br />

Very disappointing.
SPOILERS.<br /><br /><br /><br />Everything felt very removed from the other books and I didn't feel as if I was reading about the same characters. I have enjoyed the last three books even though sometimes I find them silly and overly cheesy but Breaking Dawn didn't endear itself to me like the other 3 have. <br />I think part of my problem with this book is how long it is. It could have covered the same plot with about 300 pages less to add to its heft. There was so much superfluous plot that could have been trimmed away and then not enough of the stuff that would add the most to the story. <br /><br />Maybe my biggest problem with Meyer's book is that she seems unable to weave plot lines together. She only ever has one thing going in her books. First Bella has to get through the wedding. Then her pregnancy. Then challenges as a newborn. Then dealing with her daughter. Then her family. Then the Volturi. These obstacles never interconnect. Once an obstacle comes up, it is resolved and Bella is left in peace until something else crops up(usually a good 50 pages later).<br /><br />The plot itself felt contrived and as if Meyer was ramming the happy ending we wanted down our throats. I didn't connect to Bella as a mother at all and it felt so out of place in the story. I felt like Bella was suddenly a total stranger and not the character who has been narrating the story for the past three books. I felt as if Meyer was trying to tell me as a reader that to have a happy ending you have to have a big happy family and a baby, which, shock and horror, isn't what all people want. It always seemed pretty clear to me that all Bella and Edward wanted was the other, why throw Renesmee into that and detract from the focal point of the entire series?<br /><br />I feel as this this might have been a good book if the whole plot line of Renesmee had been completely cut out. It didn't fit in with what we already know about Edward and Bella and most of all, I think the presence of the child threw every single character out of whack. Then, to top it off, Jacob imprinting on her made me more than a little sick to my stomach. <br /><br />Overall, the plot felt like she stole it straight out of fanfiction and it felt like a waste of time to drudge through 800 pages of every single thing in the world being tied up with a "pretty bow" as Meyer put it.

A Juvenile Conclusion, A Wasted Opportunity, A Let-Down & A Cop-Out
I'm 46 years old, and I bought the first 3 books for my teenage son.  He liked them so much that I read them myself; I was pleasantly surprised!  Although Meyer's writing is amateurish in places, she absolutely knows how to tell a tale.  For the most part, I was mesmerized.  In fact, I read the trilogy twice.  And there was so much great story build-up, and so much opportunity for character growth and excitement in this 4th book; I bought it at midnight and read it all night so my son could have it the next day.  Wow, am I ever disappointed.<br /><br />To me, the first book was without question the strongest.  The second book was also strong and I really enjoyed the dynamic of the Jacob relationship.  It's true that Bella's incessant whining and ludicrously melodramatic pining for Edward (God, shut UP already about your 'wound'!) was aggravating enough to take me out of the story several times - but really, I couldn't put it down.  The third book was the weakest of the trilogy, in that there is very little action until the end, the school storyline was all but dropped, and there wasn't a lot of character development - especially from Perpetual Victim Bella, who continued to be incredibly needy and dependent (while inexplicably attractive to every male in Washington), as well as in peril at all times (I hope that doesn't make other young women WANT to be victims!).  But still, as I say, the series overall was gripping and enjoyable enough to have me impatiently awaiting Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br /><br />While I was waiting - I was hopeful.  I was hopeful that Bella would grow as a person and not be so needy(and tearful, and prone to fainting, and melodramatic, and selfish).  And I was REALLY hopeful that Bella would realize how incredibly dysfunctional her relationship with Edward was.  (I know the young girls LOVE Edward but please consider for a moment if his personality was NOT packaged in a perfect body with an angel face and velvet voice, as well as super strength and speed, a nice car, and piles of money. Imagine if Edward's personality was in a scruffy working-class joe.  I have to believe that most would then see his overbearing over-protectiveness and his controlling domineering nature as just what they are - sick and unpleasant.)  I felt that there was some good foreshadowing in the 2nd book (how unhealthy her mourning of Edward was & how she felt better with Jacob) and in the 3rd book (how she realized that she also loved Jacob & and how she was scared to become immortal)that gave me hope that in the end, Bella would see Edward for what he was - her first crush (and yes, those first loves are cripplingly strong) but not her forever love.  Neediness is not love!  Being told what to do and what to drive and who to be friends with is not being loved!  Being a victim is not sexy!  Desire to forsake your friends, family, and humanity is NOT healthy!  Stephanie Meyer had a great opportunity to show the growth of a young woman, to show the maturity that Bella could have gained that would have made her see the unhealthiness in her relationship(s)...  Bella could have acknowledged the Odious Edward as a first love and someone who would always have a place in her heart, but not someone with whom she'd spend eternity - forsaking her own identity in the process.  Bella could even have wound up as a College Freshman who cares about friends and education and life - without a boyfriend for a while!  There's huge opportunity for character growth there - as well perhaps as a lesson of sorts to Meyer's young readers.  <br /><br />But Meyer cops out incredibly.  Bella stays with Edward AND becomes immortal AND does not have to deal with any consequences for this (WTH?) AND has a baby (!) at 19.  What sort of a message is this?  During the entire tedious book I was cringing to imagine young impressionable girls fantasizing about finding a boyfriend who would tell them what to do, and be jealous of any other man they are friends with, and  over-protect them so they never have to learn to take care of themselves, and provide for them so they never have to learn to provide for themselves... a boyfriend they would give up everything for... but it would all be okay and have a happy ending and they would live happily ever after.  It sickened me.  All I can say is that I hope that the young women of today are mature and self-confident enough to take this series for what it is - an exciting fantasy tale - and not actually dream of an 'Edward' in their lives.<br /><br />ETA:<br />I see that a lot of people are saying that the negative reviewers (such as myself) have a problem with happy endings.  I have no problems at all with happy endings!  What I have a problem with are happy endings that are too easy, and too neat, and require retcon and deus ex machinas galore to achieve.  They aren't 'real' - and of course I don't mean that vampires are real so everything in the book should be realistic - I mean that they aren't true to the story or, in this case, even to the canon of the story.  Things like that are a slap in the face to devoted fans - such as myself- who have invested time, money, thought, and emotion into these characters and this story, and (rightly) expect a good payoff - a conclusion that works within the framework that the author herself has created.<br /><br />The author herself spent 3 books outlining and detailing the many things that Bella would have to give up in order to join the Cullens.  She set up the dilemma, the choice that Bella had to make.  And then she turned around and allowed Bella to become immortal (& stay with Edward) without actually having to lose anything or make any sacrifices at all!  It's fake, unearned, 'cheat' endings like this that I have a problem with - not happiness per se.<br /><br />I do personally have a problem with Uber-Controlling Edward (I prefer hot to cold, life to death),  but I know that a lot of people like the Bella/Edward romance.  Stephanie Meyer could have kept Bella and Edward together and still given a conclusion that would be palatable to me, and others.  All she had to do was stick to the canon of her world, and have Bella go through the things we thought she'd go through (losing friends and family, newborn-vamp strife, giving up the ability to have a child, etc) to become a vampire... and the inherent conflict in that (plus perhaps an Epic Battle or 2) would have made for a meaty read that stayed 'true' and was therefore satisfying.  But, as I said, she copped out and made it all too easy.<br /><br />This ISN'T a fairy tale.  Fairy Tales are for young children.  This is a series for adults - both young & old - and I expect a mature level of writing that reflects that.  I didn't get it with BD, and I am pissed off about it.

Horrid - horrid writing - horrid story
SPOILERS HEREIN!!!<br />First let me say that I set aside my sociopolitical objections to the limited goals Meyer set up for girls in the first three books, and I was able to enjoy them quite a bit. But here, Meyer broke all the rules of story construction, and the results are incredibly disappointing. Evidently Stephanie Meyer didn't like the restrictions she had imposed on herself. She didn't like the mythology she had created for vamps, because she certainly didn't stick to them when they boxed her in in BD.  She didnt like Bella's human limitations, because those all went out the window when she needed to be flawless.  She didn't like the sacrifices Bella would have to make to live as a vampire, because those flew to the four winds when they became inconvenient. She had her family, her memory, her heart, her best friend, her self-control, and a daughter. Hmm.  Weren't the first three books about how EVERY ONE of those things would be lost to her if she became a vampire?  Doing my best to forget the ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC role model Bella provided before, the girl in this book is likely the most damaging character to which young girls have been exposed since, well, ever.  Not only does Meyer seem to encourage girls to a)worship a guy  b)marry and [presumably] give up EVERYTHING for that guy (though MEyer's final book made that handily unnecessary) and c) become a teenage mother,  but now I am convinced she is encouraging young girls to wish they could actually become the undead. Oddly, I am more upset about the breaking of all the rules of writing and construction than the terrible pre-victorian life she suggests for Bella. YOU created the stinking world, MEYER! Shame on you for not living within the restrictions of your own creation.  Where was your freaking editor? He/She should be tarred and feathered alongside you.

I'd rate this negative if I could
I don't care how much you loved Twilight, how loyal you are to Meyer, or how you want to delude yourself into thinking this is a good book out of devotion--don't. It's horrible, like published fan-fiction, only worse. Oh, and let me explain near the end of this why you shouldn't listen to the 5 star reviews. <br /><br />First, the writing is just terrible. So much of it is generically vague and non-descript, and we're constantly told what happens instead of shown. The characters act like dolls, and much of it seems to be trite dialogue. There is a lot of back and forth where it seems like they're only going through the motions. Beyond this though, the first person narration is truly horrible. At times, it feels as if Bella isn't narrating at all, or she's not even there. Some cutoffs from her dialogue to her straight thoughts don't read well, and sound as if she's still speaking out loud when she isn't. There's no reflectiveness in her character, or really much at all. There's also a terrible abuse of unnecessary adverbs and bad dialogue tagging. <br /><br />"He shuddered convulsingly" (pg 67) will never be a good sentence, and it's not the only one like it. It's redundant in and of itself, and indicative of lazy writing description. This is not to say that adverbs can't exist--they're essential, sometimes. But Meyer's complete abuse of them to convey all her points cheapens the writing. Further, she far abuses such tags as "I lied" and "he questioned" to get her point across about the speech. This is bad, because it's overdone, and if "I lied" is all we get from Bella in particular points to convey the scene (and it is, for there is too much dialogue without much actually happening) then it's not conveying what's going on well. If you were reading quickly, you could have missed it. <br /><br />The plot, itself, reads like it was stolen from a fangirls wet dream. Meyer is even inconsistent with her own world, essentially breaking her own rules to make the plot work. Good authors don't do that. Sorry Meyer. Maybe you should consider taking actual creative writing workshops instead of bragging that you haven't. It's nothing personal, but you can do better than this crap.<br /><br />Spoilers below this point. I say you really have to read some to understand just how -bad- this book is. Bella is a horrible role module character, and the messages in this book are not things that should be promoted. <br /><br />To start with, Bella begins the book by complaining about being rich and getting what she wants. Considering it's in her personality to complain about everything, as it seems, this is somewhat problematic, as it shows a pretty selfish character. She gets a Mercedes Guardian, not even released in America yet, and bitches about it. Not a great way to begin to connect to the audience for one. Am I supposed to feel sorry for her that she has this awesome car? Because that's a big NO. Do I see her as humble for not wanting to be seen with it? No, not particularly. Because she just "doesn't want to draw attention to herself." Because she's getting married at 18, and she's just embarrassed, I guess. But really, not a good way to begin. The narrator doesn't get better. <br /><br />The wedding was shallow. It's amazing how little of it is actually described, other than being "amazing," which honestly doesn't explain much. Bella essentially loses all doubts she may have had as soon as she gets up there on the alter and kisses Edward, effectively cheapening any depth there could have been to any underlying issues. Bella doesn't come to terms with anything--she just suddenly knows that this is all well and good. At this point it might be worth it to note that there's not even a description of what Bella looks like in her wedding dress, other than "stunning." Come on, Meyer. You even said you were exited to write the wedding. Where's the wedding? Oh, and Bella also hardly seems to worry at all about leaving her friends and family behind forever. Nope, just a little tinge, but really, she can sex Edward, so it's okay.<br /><br />About the sex. They have conversations about it without outright saying so, and even do the deed once before saying the word outright. This can be fine, but the way it was done was such a mess, it seemed more like Meyer was afraid of sex or the mention of the word. It's somewhat obvious that sex is what they're talking about, but even so, it's still annoying. Also, The sex scene itself was ridiculous and boring. Never mind my personal belief that by Meyer's rules, it shouldn't even be possible (vampires have no blood or any real liquid, except for venom. I wonder how exactly Edward would "get it up" without blood and with a lack of hormones, unless he just has that kind of control over his penis. Although, since Edward is described as basically being as hard as a statue all the time, even if he's flaccid you might get something to work there [though it shouldn't]. And I still have my doubts about how truly amazing their sex should be, as I really wouldn't want cold hard marble in my vagina, no matter what guy I was with. But I digress. Of course, their sex is wonderful, because everything has to be perfect, and Bella is completely a cannon Mary-Sue). <br /><br />Further about the sex. Edward apparently just can't control himself after the sex, and eats the pillows, tearing them to shreds. The second time he attacks the headboard. Judge that one for yourself. I find it ridiculous. <br />Even -further- about the sex. Bella and Edward are, first of all, both virgins until this point. Bella, after realizing just how absolutely amazing it is, decides that she wants it all the time, seriously begging for it like a sick sex-obsessed puppy. Nice going Meyer. That's totally what every 18 year old should act like. Even worse though, is that after her first orgasm, Bella decides that being human really isn't so bad. Because the sex is awesome, and she enjoys being hormonal. Also, great message. The only reason to stay human is to have absolutely amazing sex (that seriously shouldn't be. You know, cold things numb you). She only wants to continue living as human and got to college because of Sex. Sex is apparently everything. Really, you know how to drive home your point Meyer. Never mind the bad representations of females you had in your other books, this takes the cake. The only reason to live is SEX. Without sex with a hot boyfriend/husband you are DOOMED. If you do not have sex, you should beg for it (Bella does) and when you have a sex dream, you should wake up crying about it because it's not real, which will make your boyfriend/husband sex you. Because sex is all you need to make you happy. And this book is for teens? I'm not saying teens couldn't handle the themes--considering the amount of slash fanfiction, most of which written by teens, I really think this is tame and altogether something not hard to deal with. The themes are nothing a 10 year old couldn't take, in all honesty, provided they were mature. But the way it's written is just bad.  Meyer, once again, proves that Bella is not at all as mature as she pretends she is. <br /><br />But of course, she might explain away the sexual obsession with the fact that Bella is pregnant with a mutant half-vampire baby that's, by the way, killing her. "What?" you might think. "But Vampires are STERILE!" Well, by Meyer's laws, they should be. Consult the Twilight Lexicon, and you will find a personal correspondence with Meyer that says pretty explicitly that vampires can't get pregnant. Their bodies freeze exactly as they are and basically die. You know what that means? No sperm. Or, dead sperm, if any. Oh, and since their bodies -can't- change--you get it. So, not only is this impossible, which means Meyer is breaking her own rules (needless to say, bad form), but the baby as a plot device is rather lame. Not only is it a slap in the face, since the idea behind picking Edward was that she'd give that all up, but it's also a bitch-slap to Rosalie and completely points to Meyer making Bella incredibly perfect. This whole thing cheapens the romance, cuts out the struggle, and makes any drama worthless. She's undercutting her own plot. BAD form. Also, Meyer's basically doing her best to give Bella everything when she doesn't deserve it, which again, points to Bella being a cannon Mary-Sue. <br />Oh, but possibly worse is the fact that Bella comes to the sudden revelation that babies are good, despite never having wanted one before and there being no actual reason for this. She "suddenly realized" that she really wanted this baby. So, message? Teens should marry early and reproduce as fast as possible--it's always a good thing. Don't wait to pop out those babies. Oh, and you'll love it, no matter what (completely screwing with character and actual reasoning there, it's not developed at all). <br />Oh, and by the way. Vampire baby? Grows three times as fast. So despite it only having been a little more than two weeks, there's a baby bump. No, I'm not kidding. It's straight from fanfiction, and there's no reasoning for it. How does Bella realize she's pregnant? Well, at first it might be hard to tell, because Meyer's lack of actual useful description of anything has Bella looking at a generic blue box when half-thought things flash through her brain, meanwhile the readers not getting much of anything. So Bella picks up the blue box, announces that her period is 5 days late, and -then- she tells you it's a box of tampons. And she really couldn't have said "the tampon box?" It's like a lame attempt to try to be dramatic. The entire book is like that. I told you, it's a fangirls wet dream. Edward and Bella sex it up a few times, mutant baby that grows so fast that it'll be full grown (18, physically) in 6 and a half years before turning into a vampire to stay 18 forever, and Jacob imprints on the baby. <br /><br />Oh, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. <br /><br />We also get a few chapters from Jacob's point of view. No, the writing itself isn't much better, although it's nice to get away from our lame heroine. it is through here that we Jacob learns of Bella being "sick" and he decides that must mean they're turning her into a vampire. So, he basically shoves himself into the Cullen's family while alienating himself from his own pack to deal with it. Upon realizing Bella is pregnant, neither he, nor Edward really approve of the kids existence and want to abort it to save Bella's life. What does Edward do though? He tells Jacob that Bella will have his kids with him. Okay, wait, what? They're married, and Edward's making a deal like that? Without even consulting his wife? And Jacob agrees? What? Do I even have to point out how wrong that is? <br /><br />Oh, and in case you didn't believe me when I told you there's way too much dialogue. Flip through Jacob's chapters. You see all the italics? How it takes up more than half the page? Those are thoughts between the pack members talking to each other. Yes, it really is all like that. All the conversations run too long too, practically hitting you over the head with the point.<br />Oh, and Jacob spends a lot of time wanting to kill Edward. Maybe that's one reason people don't like the themes in this book for children. Honestly, it's written in such a way it doesn't matter. He might as well be contemplating squishing a tic. <br /><br />Oh, and here's a little side-rant. Bella's supposed to have "a private mind" right? But then Meyer also says how easy she is to read. In Jacob's chapter, he says so too. Being easy to read is not compatible with having a private mind. But Logic has long run away. <br /><br />Oh, and Jacob's descriptions aren't better either. Emmet is "the big one," and Rosalie is "the showy one." Yup. That says a lot. <br />And apparently, Jacob can't kill vampire girls, because they're girls (175). That's not Sexist in any way. (These books are all extremely sexist. Not a single strong female character exists. Remember Bella? Not strong). <br /><br />I'm going to skip over a lot, because one review can't possibly do justice to all the problems this book has. <br /><br />Skipping over how Bella's basically dying until she drinks some blood and all that such crap, Bella gives birth and is basically dying. That's right, she's dying in childbirth when she gets turned. Raped fanfiction, and generally done before. Bella gets not one vampire superpower, but 2. She gets a LOVE SHIELD that she can use to protect people she loves (which should essentially just be her and Edward and Jacob, because she shows no real love to anyone. No, actually, not even Edward, because it seems more like lust there than love). A Love Shield? Really? Wow, that's not pathetic either. Breaking out the "protected by love" thing is pretty sad, and it's another way to drain the drama. Not that we'd be allowed to believe that anything bad could ever actually happen anyway, because Meyer needed to go for the overkill happy ending that never makes sense if you want to go for even the most minor shot of realism. She also gets the ability to read memories. I don't know how Meyer can justify either of those, since from what we can see of Bella's personality and gifts, neither of these makes sense. And of course, never mind that most vamps would only get one power. Bella is so UBER special, she gets two.<br />She's also so uber special, that she turns complete vamp faster than anyone, because her heart was stronger than even Emmett's. That makes no sense, except that Meyer fails at symbolism. It also functions as yet another way to make Bella so extra special that no one can deny it and she lives a perfect life, despite the fact that it makes no sense. Oh, and all that talk about being a crazed newborn vamp? Might as well not be there. Bella is sooooo cool, she adapts without really having to think about it. Because she's soooooooooooooooo special, she defies the reality Meyer had set in place, for no reason. Just like fanfiction. This is lame, and it undercuts the drama. It makes everything that came before it mean nothing. There's no overcoming obstacles. All the obstacles that were there for drama are conveniently taken down, or not true obstacles at all. It's cheap, and bad form. <br /><br />Do I have to continue to prove this book is terrible? <br /><br />Well, yes. I'm cutting out again though, because there's no way to fit all the issues with this book in here. (BTW, Bella protects people in the battle with the Voultri with her love shield. Hello, Sailor Moon). <br /><br />This one's somewhat a personal issue, but the name Renesmee (Renee and Esme) is ridiculous, and WAY too cutesy and overdone, especially considering the rest of the book. And the middle name is Carlie (Charlie and Carlisle). That's just weird. But don't worry. Jacob nicknames the baby Nessie, which is sooo much better (Lockness Monster). That one's just weird. <br /><br />But to ensure a happy ending for all, Jacob, failing to get Bella, imprints on little Nessie. Which is not creepy, or like a pedophile at all. But don't worry, because it's alright. She's his soulmate now, she'll grow up in 6 1/2 years, and be a complete adult that he can sex (with "chocolate brown eyes" like her mother, because that description is not overused at all. Brown is never brown, it's chocolate). So yeah, he's basically raising the kid he's going to sex up while still technically too young for him and protect the kid from it's own parents, Jacob can insert himself in the Cullen family of love, and everyone's happy. But Meyer has never had issues with older men dating little girls. Edward is, like, 100, remember? I'll leave the ranting on the overtly sexist themes to someone else--there's always someone else ready to point it out. In short, Edward is abusive (overtly controlling) and Jacob, though still my favorite since he was the only character that didn't make me want to murder someone in New Moon, is somewhat like a rapist (forcing himself on Bella).<br /><br />So Meyer, what was it you said about giving everyone a happy ending? Yeah, you kinda screwed that up when you got your fans both saying the whole Nessie situation was sick. People already have their twilight icon's switched to "July 28 08, the day the fandom died" (the day it was released early in Texas). <br /><br />Oh, and Meyer's also screwing with the idea of the Incubus to explain away Bella's pregnancy. Edward is now an incubus. Never mind that the incubus and vampire were two distinct creatures, but the incubus generally needs to have had sex at least once before so it can get the sperm to impregnate the women (either it was also a succubus, and it sexed men to get their sperm and then turned into an incubus and had sex with women, or it sexed a succubus to get the sperm the succubus had gotten). If Edward doesn't get sperm, this is a problem. She screwed with the rules, and she's completely butchering another creature that doesn't deserve it. The explanation still doesn't make sense, and it's too much explaining without enough plot. <br /><br />As for any positive reviews here, let me counter a few of them, and explain why they don't matter. <br /><br />first of all, to the people saying Meyer left loopholes to get herself out of the Nessie thing. Good authors don't need loopholes. When you reach a point, even a surprising one, there should be some reason that it clicks, and it shouldn't need to be completely re-explained. The explanations are not particularly good either. If she had established a world in which this made sense from the beginning, but simply misled everyone to believe it was impossible, it's different from completely blindsiding people. "She left loopholes" is not an excuse. It's BAD WRITING. DON'T excuse Meyer for it, just because you're devoted and want so desperately to believe it's good and okay. DON'T ignore things that she herself told you. DO think about it logically, even with the story's own internal logic. It fails itself repetitively, and everyone is out of character. <br /><br />I'll point out that people left 5 star reviews before they read the book. I'll also point out that most of those reviews are exceedingly short. They don't say much of anything. Think about what they actually say. I'm betting some were written out of loyalty to Meyer and Twilight, and this book doesn't deserve it. The book is shallow. Other five star reviews blatantly state they just really want the book, and you can't let that decide for you. <br />"This is fiction," doesn't cut it as a reason that Meyer isn't consistent within her own universe. Even if you ignore that the writing has progressively gotten worse after each book she wrote, fiction still has to make sense within itself, or it's not worth anything. Fiction should still say something. Meyer's not saying anything except that Bella can get whatever she wants with no real sacrifice, and all girls should be shallow, have sex, and a great many of other truly appalling things. And she broke suspension of disbelief to do it, which is something you never want to do. <br />"Think about Meyer's religion," doesn't cut it either. Why? Because she shouldn't be forcing her Mormon beliefs on us, and even so, she's creating a horrible role model that begs for sex. Begging for sex is stupid. The problem isn't necessarily that Bella's married at 18 so much as this entire thing is idealized. At the point at which this is passed off as the purest form of pure love and something all people should aspire to, it's bad. I don't believe it is true love, but Meyer says it is, and is saying that this is what all true love is like. And forcing your religious beliefs on the masses is wrong. At least, in the US it is. <br /><br />And seriously -HALF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK-. <br /><br />"Bella is IN LOVE with Edward it is completely different and she has had to SACRIFICE alot for this." No. Fail. She didn't sacrifice, because she got most of it back anyway. <br /><br />"I think the book is good, and maybe she wont publish midnight sun because of how bad people are saying Breaking Dawn is." Speaks for itself. Don't rate it good just because you think you won't get Midnight Sun. Trust me, Meyer will get it published. She has too many fangirls who'd buy anything she wrote.<br /><br />"Isn't every book a glorified fanfic." No, actually. Meyer is fangirling all over herself on this one. Fanfiction is fiction written by fans, often used to create fantasies that the writer wished would happen themselves or making characters do things they wouldn't normally do, or are out of character. Not all fanfiction is like that, but a mass of it is. Meyer is writing her own characters out of character. That's bad. There's a confused definition between an author who likes their own writing and someone who squees over every line they write. <br /><br />Let me also point out that as of the time I checked, the most helpful favorable review had 1 out of 8 people say it was actually helpful. Negative? 66 out of 79. <br /><br />So before you buy all those happy reviews, think a little longer.<br /><br />If this review is making you mad, why? Because the Twilight Saga is your love? Because it has to be amazing? Well, it isn't. This is the only book I've ever found that I'd pronounce complete dreck. Ever.<br /><br />I don't mind the change in tone of the book. I love darker things. I love gore. That's not a problem.<br /><br />To the people who say that "you have to read with an open mind," fine. You can do that. But if thinking critically leads to the reasoning that it's not a good book, than it's not a good book. You shouldn't have to tell yourself not to think to be able to enjoy a book. There's a difference between keeping an open mind and accepting that pigs do in fact fly.<br /><br />Let me explain why I am not surprised. <br /><br />Twilight was a good book, for what it was. It's not deep literature, but it's an easy read, and it's cute--provided you don't try to look too deep for meaning. The writing itself wasn't amazing. Well, Meyer hadn't written anything before that, so it's not surprising. I finished reading the book, somewhat satisfied. I read it prepared to hate it, and I was pleasantly surprised I didn't have to, even if it'd never be my favorite and it was easy to poke holes in. Problems in that book include Bella being annoying as all hell as a first person perspective. You don't get a real sense for most of the other characters at all, and there're really flat. Jessica is written off as shallow while Bella is being shallow herself (Eric and Mike were only ever nice to her and without even knowing them Bella writes off Eric as a total overambitious geek and Mike as a puppy). He love of Edward focuses far too much on Edward's beauty, and not much on what actually makes them click together. For the sake of space, I direct you here http://otahyoni.livejournal.com/130432.html to see an actual count, and if you really want to know, the fact that Edward stalked Bella while she was sleeping before she even know him is creepy, not true love. There were flaws in the books. <br /><br />And then they got worse. New Moon was a train wreck. The pacing was horrible. Bella spends over half the book angsting without much actually happening, and to get over it she hooks up. Because You Are Never Complete Without Your Man. She takes months to get over it, which is unrealistic no matter how many times you claim their soulmates. There was no falling in love anywhere. Edward's and Bella's getting to know each other was a game of questionare, and knowing each other's favorite colors does not equal love. Edward wouldn't even let Bella ask him questions, instead insisting that she wasn't allowed. Jacob is better, and actually does something other than stare at Bella. Then he clings to her and angsts about being a werewolf in Now Moon, because somehow despite the fact that every single page in that book is dripping with angst and Bella being semi-suicidal, there's not enough of it yet. There's not subtlety to anything. And the whole plot is a mess and doesn't make sense. <br /><br />Other problems with the books as a whole are the vampire's vitual perfection, to the point that they're so overpowered there can hardly be much drama without Bella acting like an idiot (when we're told that she's super smart). The books are exceedingly repetitious, mostly on the points of angst and Edwards beauty. I find it irritating. "He's hot" shouldn't make up for a lack in personality. Bella's not allowed to actually be flawed, so everyone loves her for no reason. Having 5 guys after you is not realistic to the extent that it's played in the book. Being clumsy is not a fault when it disappears when convenient and is only used to make her look cute or relatable. I don't relate to Bella at all, and I'm almost 17. I get that Edward's a vampire, but there's not much actually shown that allows there to be any real feeling of danger. He says over and over that he's a danger, but he never backs it up. At that point, it doesn't matter, and when you can't see the fact that it's a problem beyond being told that it is, then it doesn't really exist the way it should. New Moon had literally 20 pages of Bella and Edward going back and forth telling each other they loved each other at the end, all very mushy and overdone, and I might have gotten a concussion with how hard Meyer hit me over the head with the Romeo and Juliet comparison. But she can't really pull subtle. Considering Juliet was naïve and an idiot, and Romeo was lusty and a pimp, the comparison is just a little too perfect in all the wrong ways (seriously, read it. Romeo was after another girl when he saw Juliet and decided she was prettier). And I'm telling you I actually enjoyed reading Twilight. But it was flawed. And New Moon was worse. And Eclipse wasn't better.<br /><br />So why is it not surprising that Breaking Dawn is seriously this bad? Because while Twilight was good, for the easy read that it is, it wasn't a deep read, and you didn't have to think hard at all. New Moon and Eclipse honestly should have just been one book, because New Moon had about 500 unnecessary pages of angsting. Meyer has been getting worse and worse with each book she pumps out in the series, not better. And for the people who want to blame the pressure Meyer was under for the dreck in this book, don't. She said herself, many events in Breaking Dawn were originally in the direct sequel to Twilight, Forever Dawn, that got pegged. She'd had it written though, so Breaking Dawn wasn't under quite the same pressure as you'd think. Meyer was the one pressuring her publisher to let her go ahead with it. So don't blame pressure on this one. <br /><br />I could explain even more reasons why I'm not surprised this book is just not good, but it comes down to the fact that I think Meyer needs to actually consider working on her writing, as opposed to living off fans that will eat anything she gave them. Honestly, it's not fair to anyone who was enjoying her work to publish something this bad. Writing for yourself is fine. If you keep it to yourself. But I guess Meyer doesn't care about the fans. <br /><br />Listen, I'm not saying hate Twilight either. But if you take a look closer, you might see what I mean that it's not perfect, even if you don't agree. I was okay with Twilight by itself. <br /><br />The series should have ended there, like it was originally intended to. Because there's only so far that a bored housewife can push a book written about a dream she had of a sparkling vampire. <br /><br /><br />As a complete sidenote, it might be interesting to note that the way Meyer describes Bella is very much like the way she herself looks. It's not directly in the books, but it's very exact. Considering I'm sure Meyer was in her own dream somewhere, the idea of it being a self-insert is entertaining, if not provable. But that's a complete other debate.<br /><br />Just, don't waste your money on this book. Get it from someone else if you must read it. <br />

A Big Dissapointment
Breaking Dawn was a big dissapointment. The reviews show as much. It isn't a good sign if a couple of hundred pages in you're finding yourself not enjoying the book. The fact that it's the last book is saddening because it's really a lousy way to end the series. Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse were not the best of the best when it came to fiction, but at least they were a good read and had a intresting plot. Breaking Dawn is just insane. My main criticism is that everything that happens is completely out of place, and has disregarded the other three books as well as butchering the characters in the process. Compare Bella, Edward, Jacob or any of them to the characters that were in Twilight. There's a big difference. Really so far the only characters i'd feel a liking to in the book would be Seth, Jasper and Jacob, and even the latter is completely messed with at the end.<br /><br />*SPOILERS BELOW*<br /><br />The main theme of the books is choice and sacrifice, dwelved even more deeply in Eclipse. Bella has the choice of been with Edward her soul mate, and as well as giving up her current life, also giving up her humanity. But she also has the choice of been with her werewolf friend Jacob, and having everything she stands to lose by becoming a vampire- children, family, growing old. In Eclipse she realises this all and it's consequences and makes he descision, she chooses Edward. That was what Eclipse was for, to show Bella she couldn't have it all. Well Breaking Dawn completely disregards all of this, even ignores it and pretends such an issue never exsisted. What was the point of even having the love triangle, the chapters about the harsh realities of been a vampire and newborn, and Rosalie's story, if it was just going to ignore it? Bella doesn't lose anything. In fact she get's everything. She has her godly looking husband, she has her own baby who is 'special' and who everyone loves, she's a beautiful vampire who's so powerful she can save all her vampire friends from the Volturi, the largest and most powerful coven of vampires, and believe it or not, she get's to have not only Jacob in her life but also her Dad Charlie who also 'knows' the truth. The point is that she becomes way too perfect to the point where you can't stand the character any longer. She's no longer likeable, you won't find yourself cheering for her, you'll find yourself shaking your head in disbelief instead because you can't believe one character could be so lucky and so liked by all the characters in the book. It's just insulting the direction this book went in and how much the character was changed. She's gone from been a smart, perceptive girl who stands up for herself, to nothing more than a sex crazed housewife! She didn't lose anything nor learn anything. I feel as if i'm not so much reading the finale to a romance as I am reading about a girls transition in becoming a housewife. <br /><br />That's another thing. The pregnancy issuse, or as I like to call it 'The Mistake of Nessie the mutant demon spawn'. She should never have been created. I'm certain that Stephenie is going to use the excuse "I only said vampires couldn't impregnante other vampires, not a vampire and a human", she's probably going to say that since Edward was a virgin when he changed, and still a virgin when he met Bella, he still had junk in his trunk, meaning he could impregante her. I still think the whole thing makes no sense and is ridiculous. Vampire venom is strong enough to heal wounds and enchance the human body, as well as get rid of bodily functions such as tears, but it can't get rid of sperm?! Why would a vampire need it anyway? If a vampires 'dead' with no beating heart, and a female vampire wouldn't be able to get pregnant anyway why would they still need sperm? It's not like they'd need it for humans because to them humans are food. Another criticism if this turns out to be true. A male vampire can impregnate a human girl but a human male can't impregante a female vampire? Where's the fairness in that? Really I saw the whole 'Half human, Half vampire' only as an excuse for Jacob, Bella and Edward to all have happy ends, and for Jacob to still be part of Bella's life. It was a horrible over used plot, and the characters actions revolving around it were horrible. Edward asking Jacob to abort the baby and impregnate Bella without her even knowing? Does that sound right? So he's virtous enough to not want to have sex before marriage, is such a perfect man, but he's ok with taking a baby life, and open marriage? I feel bad for Edward, Breaking Dawn really messed around with him. The only characters who even appear to have any sense are Jasper or Jacob. Jacob because he can actually see how messed up everything is, and Jasper because he's actually annoyed at 'perfect Bella' when she manages to be the best newborn ever. If I was him I would have left with Alice and not returned. Get away from the madness before it's too late and they end up like Jacob.<br /><br />I was expecting a happy ending. Not because I wanted it, but because fans kept mentioning how Stephenie "loved her characters" and "liked happy endings". I wouldn't have minded it. But I seriously can't handle endings which are so happy and sugar filled that even i'm sitting there not able to take it. It didn't have to be a total blood bath or depressing ending like Deathly Hallows or Sweeney Todd but would it have killed to have a realistic one? Maybe someone important dying, maybe Jacob going his own way to live his life somewhere else, Bella finally growing up and maturing? Instead we have a cute lovey dovey chapter at the end like a fairy tale, with the two in the cottage tucking their child into bed and having a romantic moment. We didn't even have a proper climax or fight with the Volturim who were defeated as quickly as they came and then even apologizing before leaving. That's like Voldemort suddenly turning round to Harry and accepting his offer to repent, it goes agaisnt the other books. New Moon and Eclipse hyped the Volturi making them seem ruthless and powerful and instead they are made out more like a joke at the end who end up skulking away with their tails bewteen their legs. If you're going to have main villains then at least do them justice and develop them, give them more time then a couple of pages, and give them some glory. Really the book was a huge letdown for me. I feel Stephenie's liking for her characters effected the story too much, there was too much information to handle, and that the whole plot was just ridiculous.<br /><br />I hope I haven't been too harsh...

Dawn broke alright, beyond repair
First of all, where was the Edward and Bella romance that we got in Twilight? I couldn't find it. His character was almost nonexistent. The wedding was too rushed, the honeymoon... not a single intimate conversation. Not really one. About what it was like to be married, how they finally felt about everything that had gotten them to this point, what they hoped for the future, nothing. I felt cheated.<br /><br />Then the pregnancy... just yuck, how Bella lit up every time Jake came over, meanwhile, Edward's going out of his mind and she seems to just not address that. Did it not occur to her how it would make Edward feel when she did stuff like that with Jake? Her constant disregard for his feelings never ceased to amaze me. And we're supposed to like her for this?<br /><br />I have to admit, I loved the delivery scene, with Edward having to deliver the baby and her just spewing blood from everywhere. Too bad Jake was there, but it was impossible to shake him, thanks Steph. If they ever make a movie of this one, I want to see that scene.<br /><br />I must say, I have read better transformation scenes in fanfiction. That was weak, but, I like Bella as a vamp much better than as a human. It really helped that she finally cut Jake loose and realized she belonged to Edward. Finally! It took her becoming a vamp for that to happen? How stupid was she as a human?<br /><br />Then the imprinting. Just weird and creepy. Almost incestuous; just a few days earlier, Jacob is having fantasies about having sex with Bella. Then suddenly, he wants her daughter. Creeped me out big time. Why couldn't he imprint on Angela or even Tanya?<br /><br />Oh, I know why, because it wouldn't have fit into the whole bizarro ending she had planned, with the wolves intimidating the Volturi. I did like Seth though; if anyone had to imprint on the kid, I wished it was him. I also thought Sam would die so Jake would have to become Alpha. But, no, nobody has to die in Stephenie's little dream world except for evil Irina, who was simply mistaken and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Off with her head.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I loved how Jake took it upon himself to go tell Charlie, just to keep them from going out of town for a few months. How selfish can you be? How inconsiderate? Just another example of how he disrespects Bella's decisions. Still supposed to be her best friend and still unable to be supportive. If he couldn't stand the separation, why didn't he just go with them? They weren't going to the moon.<br /><br />I hate Renesmee but I like it better than Nessie. Couldn't they have called her Rennie.. or what about sticking Elizabeth in there somewhere for Edward's mother? But nothing tops Edward Jacob. I almost barfed. I'm sure Edward wanted to name his son that. What was Stephenie on when she wrote this???<br /><br />I was never worried that E and B wouldn't end up together. She's not THAT stupid. But I didn't see the baby or the imprinting coming. I thought we resolved the love triangle in Eclipse, but at the reception, there it was again. I wanted to scream and I wanted to slap Bella, and therefore, Stephenie. Jake is hugging her, so Edward comes back and Jake's stink is all over her Wedding Dress. Funny, it occurred to me but it didn't occur to Bella. She's always so worried about hurting Jake but she doesn't seem to worry about hurting Edward.<br /><br />The only time she did seem to consider his feelings was when she was trying to hide her own pain, with the pregnancy and the transformation. The only time. She could hang onto Jake all she wanted with never a backward glance in Edward's direction. Did Stephenie do that on purpose or did she just think that was acceptable behavior? Is she completely insensitive?<br /><br />Talk about a big build up with no climax... let's just chit chat with Aro and then glare at each other and then they'll turn around and go back to Italy. Yeah, that's a great ending; what a let down.<br /><br />And a love shield? Yeah, I like Lily Potter too, but I would try to come up with something original for my fourth novel, not something that's already been done by JK Rowling. And since when was Bella's love her strongest human trait? Her closed mind, yes, love shield, no.

Review for Parents of Young Readers
***Spoilers***<br /><br />This is the best of the four books in this series, but it is still awful. Many of Meyer's writing problems (like her repetitive adjective usage) seem to have been mysteriously fixed, but other problems remain. Messages that young readers might take away are not the best.<br /><br />1. The character of Jacob is authentic and well-developed: <br />What he says and does fits his age, personality and life situation.  The middle portion of the book, written from his point of view, was genuinely good. Some threads are not finished, like the backstory for Leah.  Why is there a female shape-shifter?  That is interesting, and while it would be stupid to make this book any longer, I would have enjoyed reading more about Leah.<br /><br />2. Bella remains vapid and non-authentic:<br />Bella's mother is simply an afterthought throughout this book, dismissed as, "Oh well,  she has Phil now."  While adolescent girls often don't like their mothers, they don't eliminate them this easily. She's lived with her mother all but the past two years of her life without any serious problems. She talks throughout the book about family bonds, and that is reflected in what we learn about the shape-shifters.  Then she becomes a mom herself and even names her baby after her mother. Yet we're to believe she's OK with the possibility that she's never going to see or even speak to her mother again? Doesn't invite her mom to her wedding? Isn't going to have her mom meet her granddaughter?  No way I can buy this.<br /><br />3. Horrible messages about marriage:<br />Bella marries in order to get Edward to have sex with her.  This is actually a "negotiation" they have.  The marriage is just a formality, to satisfy Edward. Bella has so little interest in her own wedding day that she allows her sister-in-law to orchestrate everything and never even asks about details.  She basically shows up on the right morning so that she can be made-up and dressed for her role as bride. She doesn't even look at herself in a mirror on her wedding day. Oh right, I believe this - not!<br /><br />4. Her husband is a pimp:<br />Imagine this.  Your husband understands that you want to have a child. He decides that his seed is unsuitable for you, so - without discussing this with you - he asks another man to 1) talk you into aborting the child you're already carrying, and 2) have sex with you to get you pregnant with this other man's child.  Worst of all, both men agree this is a great idea.<br /><br />5.  Her father, the chief of police, is not curious about his daughter's life:<br />In fact, he's operating on a "need to know" basis and seems perfectly happy not having a clue about what is going on.  This is not how the chief of police would behave, and certainly not how a parent would behave. Parents are hard-wired to protect their children from danger. Young people reading this book might like to be reminded that you, as their parents, care a great deal about the people and events in their lives.<br /><br />5.  The plot isn't logical:  <br />Connections do not flow from point A to point B in a reasonable way.  For example, all the talk about the Volturi collecting "prizes" yet none of that comes to bear.  So why bore us with this? All the talk about death and loss, yet no one dies or loses anything. At the end, Alice thinks to find another human/vampire mix child to prove that this is not an unknown and therefore not dangerous. Um, how did she ever arrive at that conclusion? The author avoids having to tell us by having Alice run away during this period. And wouldn't it be great to see Jacob's reaction to having a new, fake ID? There's much, much more like this that doesn't work.<br /><br />6. More terrible plot devices:<br />Bella needs to discover that she is pregnant while on her honeymoon so just how does a skilled author make that happen.  Let's see.  Oh right, counting tampons.  Isn't that how we all found out we were expecting, by sitting alone in the bedroom counting tampons? Puh-leese.  If we are going to suddenly introduce the idea of Bella's menstrual cycle then shouldn't that have come up, oh, maybe 2,000 pages ago since it deals with BLOOD! If you're hanging out with vampires this might have been an issue near the start of those relationships.<br /><br />7. So easy it's unbelievable:<br />Even in the vampire world Bella's transition is simply too smooth. Though this is fantasy, I can't suspend my disbelief. A volatile, immature and arguably unstable teen is reborn as a vampire and her biggest problem is a torn dress?  Come on! The confrontation with the Volturi is the most anticlimactic reading I may have ever done in my life. The happily-ever-after ending is too tidy. No one pays, nothing is lost, nothing is earned. It is completely unsatisfying.<br /><br />8. The gore:<br />There is a lot of blood in this book.  Bella drinks blood like milkshakes during her pregnancy, there is vomiting of blood in a spectacular, fountainous way, and Edward chews the baby out of Bella's abdomen.  There is CPR on a dead body, venom injections into the heart, some biting and more detail on the hunting and blood sucking of animals.  There is also violent sex.  While Meyer doesn't actually tell us anything about the sex act, the aftermath has Bella severely bruised.  I don't know about you, but I don't want my child growing up thinking that sex hurts, that sex is violent or that if your partner is violent enough to leave you black and blue it's OK to beg for more, like Bella does.<br /><br />9. This story could have been told in two books, not four.  <br />I read over 2,400 pages in order to complete the entire series and feel like the story could have been told in half the pages if it had been handled by a more skilled writer. She could have spared a few hundred pages just by cutting the adverbs. Then saved another few hundred by editing out useless information, like the necklace from Aro.  What the hell was that all about?<br /><br />10. Even a 6th-grader can spot crap writing:<br />My 11-year-old enjoyed the books, but that may have been because "everyone else was reading them."  Now that we've talked about each book I'm being told, by a 6th grader, that huge portions of the books were boring or unnecessary, that the plot outcomes were disappointing, that these characters are unlikable and fake people that he would not want as friends, and that it was just too easy to root for Bella to die since she was unworthy. I agree on all counts.<br /><br />As I've said in previous reviews, I don't ever want to discourage my child's reading, and I think that even reading garbage like this is better than reading nothing.  But it is also my opinion that if garbage of any type is going into my child, it has to pass by me first.  (That includes junk food, junk TV and junk reading). If your child is reading this series I encourage you to read along with them and hope that these poorly written books can at least lead to interesting, productive conversations.

Love Triangle resolution doesn't make sense
As mentioned in most of the one star reviews, one of the main problems with this book is the fact that the author completely abandoned the rules that she had established in the previous 3 books regarding vampire physiology and behavior, and it seems like the only motivation for doing this was to provide a plot for her final book and a happy ending for every single character.  Everyone gets what they want and it doesn't cost them anything.  That was plain lazy writing and a betrayal of the readers that invested their time and emotions into the series.<br /><br />Possible Spoilers Ahead<br /><br />However, my biggest problem with this book was the way that Meyer resolved the love triangle.  I understand if her plan was always to have Bella choose Edward.  But what doesn't make sense is the way that she went about having Bella make that choice.  Meyer spent two books (New Moon and Eclipse) describing Bella's relationship with Jacob, the joy she felt in his company...they have fun, they laugh, they tease, they comfort each other...Meyer establishes Jacob as a true companion for Bella.  Despite Bella's continued assertions that she doesn't have romantic feelings for Jacob, her actions and emotions say something completely different.  This could make sense if the readers where being given an insight into the character's feeling that she herself might not be aware of...However, that doesn't end up being the case.<br /><br />In contrast Bella and Edward's relationship is established almost exclusively with the author's and Bella's insistence that they are in love and meant to be together.  The reader never gets to see or understand why this is so.  I can't remember them ever actually doing anything together (other than all the angst ridden kissing) or really communicating with each other (other than telling each other how in love they are).  I got the feeling that they didn't really know or understand each other....<br /><br />My point is that while it is the author's prerogative to decide who Bella chooses to love, she has an obligation to have it make sense to the reader.  She should have shown us why Bella chooses Edward, not simply told us that it was so.  <br />

Easily the worst book I've ever read.
`Blonde jokes', Bella talking non-stop about her incredible beauty, endless petty fighting between characters, rampant antifeminism, a disturbing anti-human sentiment, paedophilia.<br />Stephenie Bella Meyer Swan is back and as self-absorbed and nasty as ever.<br /><br />Adjectives and adverbs are used to a laughable point. And the repetition is painful. Everyone's got `tight eyes', and Alice is always `dancing' everywhere.<br /><br />Meyer trots out another string of beautiful blondes to show us how undesirable they are to her heroes. Can anybody say `wish fulfilment'?!<br /><br />The Mormon overtones are so obvious it's frightening nobody much thinks about it. The Mormon-style baby naming of combining family names. Meyer attended Brigham Young University - a Mormon university - where they are constantly told to marry young and start reproducing; which is exactly what Bella Sue does. There's a frightening anti-abortion message: even if your spawn rips your body to shreds - kills you - you MUST fight everybody to keep it. Imprinting is essentially what Mormon `sealing' is.<br />And, no doubt, Meyer pays tithings, which would mean every year the fans are sending millions of dollars to the Mormon church.<br />How is it Americans were up in arms about a bit of magic in British Harry Potter books, but they're happy with paedophilia and religious propaganda in American Twilight books?<br /><br />We've got more `werewolves' (sorry - at the very end of the book they are suddenly `shapeshifters') falling in love with babies. But don't worry, one special baby is going to be ready for sexual duties by her seventh birthday. How romantic.<br /><br />The unintentionally hilarious scenes of the happy family - accompanied by paedophile Jacob - dressed to the nines, running off into the forest to guzzle on wild animals, tip this already ridiculous book even further over the edge.<br /><br />The appeal of the initial story was the contrast between Bella's humanity and Edward's immortality. The moment Bella wakes up a wild huntress superhero in possession of a `love shield' we lose any possible connection we could have had with her, as she divides her time between admiring her own beauty and fantasising sexually about her husband (even when covered in blood, in a ripped cocktail dress, barefoot and in the middle of a forest).<br /><br />And how about those deux ex machinas?! Isn't it great how every time there's a problem something miraculous pops up out of the blue to save the day? So once again none of our characters have to actually solve a problem, or - you know - do something.<br /><br />Additionally, I have no idea how any intelligent or sane person can remain a Twilight fan after reading about Edward EATING mutant vampire baby spawn out of his wife. Romantic it is not.<br /><br />This series is a disaster, but no installment so much as this final one.<br /><br />I hope the next tween fad makes an appearance soon. Stephenie Meyer is definitely not deserving of any more money.<br /><br />Avoid this ridiculously long mess.<br />

Ms. Meyer: Next Time Get Yourself a Red Pen and a Good Editor
I'm an English teacher and so, I admit, I tend to be a little more critical of style, grammar and usage, but surely any avid reader will note the many flaws in Meyer's latest installment.  This book is so badly written it is difficult to get through.  (Indeed, I found myself groaning aloud while reading particularly sappy descriptions or badly constructed sentences.)  Meyer's first three books were poorly written in places as well, but at least the characters were compelling and the overall storytelling satisfying.  However, "Breaking Dawn" is sadly disappointing because one suspects that Meyer didn't take care with her language or her subject matter.  Unlike some readers, I never thought Meyer compared to Rowling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439554934">(Harry Potter)</a>, but now I'm more convinced then ever that she ought to take a few good writing classes at her nearest university.  She clearly has many creative ideas, but she needs to learn how to effectively bring those ideas to life.  <br /><br />For example, I agree with many of the critics here that "Breaking Dawn's" happy ending is a disappointment because Bella does nothing to earn it.  There is nothing heroic about her since she gets all she desires with virtually no sacrifice or work on her part.  She doesn't even have to struggle with her blood lust very much when she's a newborn vampire, or give up her relationship with her human father.  Of course, some will say that "Breaking Dawn" is just "fiction," but the best fiction (even fantasy and sci-fi) mimics  the emotional struggles in life and is thus full of sacrifice and tough choices.  Even many fairy tales like the original Little Mermaid abide by this principle as is seen when the Little Mermaid trades in her scales for legs that "cut like knives every time she walks."  Disney <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O35U">(The Little Mermaid)</a>, of course, radically changed this story, insisting on a happy ending that Hans Christian Anderson <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8714273926">(The Little Mermaid)</a> never included and, in my opinion, radically diminishing the power of the original story, but that's neither here nor there.  All I'm saying is that Bella badly needs to gain wisdom and maturity and she cannot do either by magically "getting it all," including an improbable hybrid baby and a storybook cottage in the woods.  <br /><br />Oh, and imprinting on infants?  That's just gross. Leah is Jake's equal and in her feisty, yet vulnerable way she is a much better potential girlfriend.  The truth is, losing your first love is hard and there is no easy way out of that.  Jake needed to reconcile himself to losing Bella, not take a magic pill, so to speak.  Sure, this series may be, as some have called it, a kind of modern fairy tale, but, as I have already pointed out, even fairy tales acknowledge the loss and pain one must endure in order to find the right companion.  I also dislike the fact that Jake imprints despite his great longing to choose his life partner.  His deep concern about losing his freewill is one of the most appealing aspects of his character and when he imprints on his first great love's hybrid offspring it is disturbing in more ways then one. <br /><br />Even worse, I was really excited right at the end because I thought we'd finally get an intense, bloody, no-holds-barred battle with casualties on both sides, but instead we got nothing but a bunch of tense moments and endless talking.  In fact, I wonder if Meyer can even write an action packed scene with multiple characters.  Think of the excitement of Rowling's final epic battle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225">(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows)</a> and you realize immediately what Meyer is missing.  The talented "witnesses" such as Benjamin do very little for all they were built up by Meyer.  Bella's immense shield was impressive, but it didn't allow for any interaction between both sides and thus the scope of her power was poorly chosen.  (Side note: I was really hoping Bella would have an active power rather than a passive one.  As a human teenager she relied on the guys in her life to rescue her far too much and had no real identity or strength of her own.  It would have been refreshing to watch her return the favor and save those she loves in an active way, a way that put her own life at risk, a way that forced her to make a difficult choice.)  Even if she had to be a "shield" for others she should have been able to shield only one other person at a time in order to allow the other vampires the chance for a knock-down fight.  Wouldn't it have been something to watch her have to choose between shielding Jake and Edward's lives, for example?  Now that would be dramatic.  <br /><br />As if all of that weren't enough, we never leave Forks except for the Isle of Ismene, which could be anywhere.  Was Meyer too lazy to research other places?  Why not take us to the rainforest, or at least follow some of the other members of the Cullen family as they round up other "witnesses"?  Oh, and why was J Jenks so necessary?  And why did we get so much detail on all the other vampires if knowing what they were capable of was not essential to the final encounter with the Volturi? There are so many internal inconsistencies, loose ends and odd details that go absolutely nowhere.<br />   <br />Another thing that bothered me was Meyer's use of point of view (POV). Why the strange insertion of Jake's POV into the middle of the story?  To be fair, Jake's humorous POV is somewhat of a relief, but it is inconsistent with the previous books.  If Meyer wanted to open up the possibilities of first person narration, wouldn't it make more sense to include other points of view, too, such as Edward's and some of the other members of the Cullen family?  What was Meyer's reasoning for suddenly plunging us into Jake's inner world, only to yank us back again and thrust us back into Bella's?     <br /><br />Finally, Meyer's foreshadowing is less then subtle.  I guessed nearly every so-called "twist" well ahead of time, which effectively killed the suspense for me.  For example, did anyone ever believe Alice wasn't off doing exactly what she was doing?  How could Edward and Bella think she had abandoned them for even a moment?  Also, having two earlier minor characters (Quil and Clare) do the same exact thing as two later main characters (Jake and Nessie) is not foreshadowing.  Meyer is both obvious and, at times, wildly inconsistent when it comes to crafting plot and she needs to take a page out of Rowling's book if she wishes to learn the true art of foreshadowing and misdirection.<br /><br />In short, "Breaking Dawn" has just enough potential to be truly disappointing. Perhaps she took on too much for a new writer and she shouldn't have tried to write "The Host" and "Breaking Dawn" at nearly the same time.  Whatever the reason, one feels the loss with each chapter, how much the book is over-written, how much it needed a truly brutal and gifted editor.  With its glaring errors and numerous inconsistencies this book reads like a rough draft, not a polished final draft.  It was all I could do not to get out my red pen.          <br /><br />P.S.  Am I the only one who, after reading this series, began to miss Buffy and Angel?  Now that was a forbidden love story between a human and a vampire! See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQ68RI">Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set</a>, especially the first three seasons.  The writing on this show is absolutely terrific and Buffy and Angel have far more chemistry then Bella and Edward.

Heart-breakingly horrible if you're a fan of the series
I'm rating this book a 1 star because I'm a fan of the Twilight series.  Perhaps if this worked as a standalone, and I didn't come in with great (or even "New Moon" level) expectations for the book, it would've left a better impression on me.<br /><br />This book started out quite well... but it doesn't take long before the author suddenly, as if she's purposely trying to ruin the book, jumps the shark.  It's as if she forgot that she was writing a vampire/human love story, and decided to turn completely sci-fi/horror.  Gone was the weak and lovestruck, but ultimately lovable Bella.  Instead, we got a girl whose motivations could no longer be identified with (It also doesn't help that this is precisely when Meyer chooses to start telling the story through Jacob's eyes).  Once the connection with Bella is broken, the reader is left hanging outside the plot, wondering how it was possible for a series so addictive to abruptly cut the bond between Bella and the reader.<br /><br />Meyer does not ever recover from that disconnect, even though she puts in a good effort.  We do get a better look at Edward through Jacob's more sensible eyes, but it does not make up for the loss of Bella, or the complete absurdity of the entire plot.<br /><br />All in all, I wish Meyer never wrote this book.  Books 1-3 were perfect.  She should have left them that way.  But if you're a fan of the series, you probably can't resist reading this anyway.  Be warned:  You're going to be devastatingly heart-broken about being forced to witness the complete downfall of an otherwise extraordinarily compelling series.

Devastated
There was so much wrong with this book that I can't even begin to explain. Note that this review will have SPOILERS.<br />I think I'll start with the fact that to me, the entire book seemed lacking some key element that all the other books have had. And that key element was what made me one of the obsessed Twilighters. Breaking Dawn throughly cured that obsession, though.<br />While reading the book, I was constantly crying "no! What?? NO!" I admit, I couldn't put the book down, because I was waiting for Stephenie Meyer to pull it together. I simply couldn't believe what I was reading.<br /><br />The first couple chapters of the book start with Edward and Bella having sex. That's all very nice, but Bella didn't give a dang about Jake. She "locked him away in her Jacob drawer." Pardon me, but he saved her life. However, by all means, lets "lock him away", shall we?<br />After the wedding, all the human characters were barely mentioned again. Bella doesn't need to be troubled with THEM anymore.<br />Bella gets pregnant. I must have missed something, because Edward has only venom in him. And if he does have anything else, shouldn't it be frozen? <br />Along with this, wasn't there supposed to be a sacrifice? Bella didn't have to spend a year as a newborn, and she developed amazing powers and "saved the day", and she certainly got that family. I was hoping for Bella to die in her pregnancy, especially when she continued going on about "Jake, are you coming back?" "Maybe..." "I might get cold, so come back."<br />SHE'S MARRIED! She should have tried to act like it.<br />So then when she gets changed, she manages to have one of those "rare" talents, just as Jake has one of those "rare" imprints. The imprinting destroys characters, and so as Bella gets everything she's ever wanted, Jake gets stuck with the daughter of the girl he once dreamed of sleeping with.<br />Well.<br />I was also more than a little disturbed at how Edward could offer Bella to Jake to have sex with for the weekend, merely so that she could become pregnant. I'm a solid Jake fan, and I found that disgusting as well as immoral.<br />Bella, as a vampire, was disgustingly perfect. To be real, a character should have imperfections. Now she is a horribly cliche Mary-Sue.<br />There was no climax. It's called an ANTI-climax. Nothing happened. All is well. The end. In fact, not much was even resolved. There are quite a few unanswered questions, one such as Embry's parentage that were not resolved with the series. And who's to say the Volturi won't come back? The problem was not even eliminated.<br />Sadly, the entire book was exactly like terrible fanfictions I've read. That is distressing to me.<br /><br />Everyone can have their own opinions, and this one is mine. It sounds harsh, but the book was a shocking disappointment. Not only did I dislike the book, but it killed the rest of the series for me. I have felt like I wasted my time and my money, and I've lost all my respect for Stephenie Meyer.

Much ado about nothing
The only people on earth who are allowed to sparkle are as follows...<br /><br />1) Drag Queens. A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug.<br /><br />2) David Bowie. Need I say more?<br /><br />Someone needs to explain the why's and wherefore's of this whole "sparkly vampire" business to me. I really don't understand it at all. Going out in daylight... OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles?<br /><br />Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroghly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick)<br /><br />As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren't any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn't any drama. This is a vampire movie with no caonflict among the main characters. Only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing's really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn't have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment "the new girl." <br /><br />Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella's sheriff dad and the "maulings" (read: vampire attacks) he's investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward's wangsting.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There's one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn't paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I'm sorry, but that's just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don't care if the poor guy is a bit character, I'd rather a small look at any if the bit characters' small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film.<br /><br />Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the "OMG bad vampires." I'll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I'm told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them.<br /><br />As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villain's aren't developed at all. They are clearly "OMG EVOL!!!1!!" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn't terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend Twilight to anyone. No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper.

Is this what love is supposed to be?
This is one of the most frightening displays of romance I've ever seen in my life.  This is NOT a love story.  Edward (male protagonist)is obsessive to the point of restraining order.  He watches her sleep, follows her everywhere and is only interested because this is the one persons mind he cannot read.  Bella (female protagonist) is about intriguing as a candy bar wrapper (an empty one at that).  <br /><br />Since I've read the books (occupational hazards of a librarian) I know this only gets worse.  In a world of quality young adult literature where relationships are often shown as fleeting and impermanent, this story should not have been published let alone made into a movie.<br /><br />After reading/viewing anything I have to ask: what's the point? In this instance I cannot come up with anything.  What is this book/movie trying to say about relationships?  Because this is scary, obsessed love, not fulfilling, lasting love.<br /><br />P.S. Why do recent authors think they have personal license to change vampire lore?

Atrocious in a thoroughly enjoyable way
I can't recall the last time I had this much FUN with a poorly-made movie. I honestly can't decide whether I want to give it 'one star' for how genuinely terrible it is, or 'five stars' for how enjoyable it was to be appalled by.<br /><br />It's a sort of tradition amongst my local friends and I to rent movies we fully expect to be bad and watch them together; often we're just bored and, by the time the ending credits roll, feeling that we just lost two hours of our lives that we shall never get back. This one, though, stands out as one of the greats. <br /><br />If you're new to the series, the premises is this: Bella Swan (yes, 'beautiful swan') moves from her arid Phoenix home to Forks, Washington, where she meets and falls in love with a dour and seemingly perpetually-nauseated boy named Edward Cullen. She soon discovers his secret - that he's a vampire! - by Googling "cold ones," a term she finds in a book of Native American mythology. One would expect that Googling this term would actually yield many pages pertaining to beer. Or maybe that's just me. Anyway, a very clingy and angst-ridden relationship ensues, and after playing baseball in a thunderstorm with Edward's family, Bella meets a nasty vampire named James, who immediately develops his own obsession with her.<br /><br />Unlike Edward, though, James wants to eat Bella. Really badly.<br /><br />Most of this takes place in the latter half of the movie. The first half is comprised mostly of Bella moping around her new town and exchanging silent stares with Edward.<br /><br />Ah, Edward.<br /><br />It gave me pleasure to discover exactly how much the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, despises Edward Cullun.<br /><br />"When I read it I was convinced Stephenie was convinced she was Bella and it was like it was a book that wasn't supposed to be published. It was like reading her sexual fantasy, especially when she said it was based on a dream and it was like, 'Oh I've had this dream about this really sexy guy,' and she just writes this book about it. Like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced, like, 'This woman is mad. She's completely mad and she's in love with her own fictional creation.' And sometimes you would feel uncomfortable reading this thing..." "...the more I read the script, the more I hated this guy."<br /><br />Edward Cullen has a completely inconsistent personality, and Pattinson solved this by playing him as, in his own words, "as a manic-depressive who hates himself."<br /><br />Now, I understand some preteen girls actually find Edward's various advances upon Bella to be romantic - like admitting to sneaking into her room to watch her sleep for months before he even made an attempt to be nice to her. I'm led to wonder how some fathers would feel if they knew their young daughters admired such qualities in future boyfriends. Personally I think Edward is downright creepy, but as Pattinson apparently meant to portray him this way, kudos to Mr. Pattinson!<br /><br />For Bella's part, she's an unabashed Mary Sue, with every male in town falling all over himself to befriend, date, or, in one scene, gang rape her. It's Edward, however, who wins her inexplicable devotion, mainly by following her around and saying things like, "We shouldn't be friends," or, "Stay away from me!" in a low menacing voice. <br /><br />By the end of the movie, after lots of heaving and sighing and rushed special-effects, we're meant to believe that the two are star-crossed lovers, though they seem more like an abusive relationship in the making. With the vampire James dispatched, Edward and Bella slaver over each other's necks at prom, and James' female companion Victoria slinks away in the backdrop, doubtlessly plotting mischief.<br /><br />There's also a sub-plot straight from the underwhelming "Underworld" series regarding a rivalry between werewolves and vampires, but it's barely touched on in this installment. <br /><br />I wonder, given his public slandering of the franchise, whether Mr. Pattinson will reprise his role as Edward in the next film. A part of me is looking forward to it.

The Few Strong Points Are Swallowed by the Overwhelming Campy Badness
I consider myself a Twilight fan. I love the books and since reading the first one have bought the other three the day they came out. I was extremely excited about the movie, and went to see it opening night. My first thought by the halfway point of the movie was: WHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS?!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Twilight: The Movie is a horrible, campy, tacky, CHEAP vampire story that swallows almost all of the power of the novels. The vampire special effects are even WORSE than "Queen of the Damned" (which is hard to achieve), and the "action" scenes were scripted, confusing, and in some cases pointless and lame.<br /><br />The acting was off and it was awful. Kristin Stewart was weak and ineffectual as Bella. She portrays none of Bella's strengths and instead presents her as, essentially, a weakling, a coward and a whiner. Rob Pattinson's Edward is kind of creepy, kind of tacky, and completely unromantic; in fact, he's kind of off-putting. None of the Cullens act like they're supposed to except Rosalie and Alice, so of course they only got about five lines each in the entire movie.<br /><br />The worst acting choice was whoever played Charlie -- he's a dead fish in the entire movie. He never displays ANY emotion. Now, in the books Charlie IS kind of closed-off, but he DOES get upset -- like when Bella says she's running away, for instance. In the movie, he's quiet and unmoved and seems to say nothing but "Oh, my daughter's running away. Don't go, Bella. Please stay, Bella. Wonder what's on TV?"<br /><br />However, first and foremost, the love story element was RUINED by the script. Bella and Edward are awkward as can be together, and at one point Edward makes the cryptic comment "It would be better for you if we weren't friends." Now, at this point in the movie, he's been nothing but a supreme jerk to Bella at every turn. If I were Bella, my response would have been: 'What?! We AREN'T friends! You're a creeper and you need to go before I call the cops! Stranger danger! [Makes sign of the cross]'<br /><br />By the time they're 'together' as a couple it feels so rushed and unnatural that you have to gag at some of Bella's more romantic thoughts, which make perfect sense in the book. One of the worst mistakes they made was combining about five different important scenes and shortening them into one confusing scene: the meadow scene, combined with the first running scene, combined with the skipping class scene, combined with three other minor scenes. It was rushed, confusing, creepy, unromantic, weird, badly acted, badly shot, and badly directed.<br /><br />The dynamic of Bella and Edward was ruined -- Edward is supposed to be so supremely larger than life to Bella; for instance, in the book when he runs (he's supposed to look like a blur, which the movie of course killed off right away) with Bella the first time she's violently ill and can't stand for a moment. In the movie she just hops off his back as if to say 'Alright, I do this all the time.'<br /><br />In the book, James, the villain, is actually rather terrifying. In the movie...okay, the actor is admittedly very attractive. But -- have you ever seen the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (NOT the show, because the show was amazing; the movie was awful)? You know, where Rutger Hauer played the most CAMPY, RIDICULOUS vampire EVER? Well, James almost TOPS his performance in "Buffy" -- again, VERY hard to achieve.<br /><br />Another point of unintended comedy? Bella and Edward spend half the friggin' movie in a TREE. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. He calls her "spider monkey," for the love of GOD. It's SILLY! And then when the Cullens jump at the 'bad vampires'? It looks like they're about to perform the song and dance "fight" in the first scene of "West Side Story!" How utterly absurd!<br /><br />The casting was awful, the acting was awful, the script was awful, the special effects were AWFUL. Possibly the only good points about this movie was the first five minutes, which actually did a very good job for some strange reason, and the last five minutes, which also did a very good job, for some strange reason. Every other minute of the movie was excruciating in its mediocrity.<br /><br />I pray to God every day that people don't watch this D-Grade piece of CRAP movie and go away thinking to themselves, "Well, now I KNOW I'll never read 'Twilight' after watching THAT crap."

Twilight of the Vampire Romance
I have to believe Twilight was the most talked-about film of 2008 in the science-fiction/fantasy community. When it hit DVD, I was anxious to see it. An hour into the film, however, I was fighting the urge to turn it off and toss the disc into the trash. How is it that this unoriginal, glacially-paced, staggeringly emotionless film has such a large fan following? I can only presume that because I'm not a young girl keeping a weepy self-indulgent diary, and therefore fall outside of the target demographic, I just don't "get it."<br /><br />My wife has read all the books five times, and was even more anxious than I to see the film, but she literally walked out of the room halfway through, never to see the end, complaining that the film version had "ruined" every single aspect of the books (though these ideas are so threadbare, I personally don't even see how the books could have been better). Naturally, a movie has to change things  --  it's a different medium from literature - but my wife assures me that the changes were arbitrary and ruinous. She also assured me that the main male character, who we both thought was terrible, was not coming across as the super-mega-hunk everyone says he is. So it's not just because I'm a guy that I thought he was flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />It's a plot point that there's little sunlight in this film, but after an hour of watching this overly blue-toned movie, you just start feeling ill. There are no flesh tones; everyone is blue and sickly-looking. It starts to wear on you. The main character looks like they magic-marker'd his eyebrows in.<br /><br />As to the plot... what plot? Listen, folks... vampire romances have been done to absolute death by now. Everything in this film, we have seen before, either through Near Dark, Forever Knight, Anne Rice novels, or even Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The brooding James-Deanish vampire love interest has passed deeply into cliché (Angel did it better, but I even thought it was getting old ten years ago). About the only thing "new" here is the idea that vampires actually look "beautiful" in their true appearance, yet on my big flat screen, what the main female character was oohing & ahhing about looked more like slimy snakeskin than diamonds, so even at THAT level, I was out of sync.<br /><br />Anyone buying or renting this film has SOME idea of what it's about, even if just from the movie poster. And yet it takes the film a full hour to get us there. We've seen this and seen it... you can hurry along to the big "reveal" and get the actual PLOT moving, please. But even when it starts to move... well... we've seen that too!<br /><br />I really do not understand what magic this film holds for people, but if you haven't seen this yet, you too are probably not among its target audience. So save yourself and give Twilight a pass. It's a tired old derivative idea presented in a stunningly boring package, with a whole cast of young, unlikeable, blue-skinned people.<br />

Sorely disappointed...
While I am not among the core demographic that this movie was targeted for, I am an enormous fan of the Twilight books. So I was more than thrilled to learn that a movie was being adapted out of them. Always one of the mind that "book is always better than the movie," I didn't have huge expectations given the budget and director. Even my lowered expectations were not prepared for the monstrocity that appeared on the screen. For 120 minutes, I watched a wooden cast run through the motions of the script. Kristen Stewart could not have been worse. Bella is a warm and charmingly clumsy young woman. Although in the books, she appears aloof at times, she loves fiercely and with all her heart. Ms. Stewart never even came close to any of those emotions except the aloofness. Her stilted portrayal of Bella was heart-breaking to watch. Even when she was being tortured by James, she barely managed a facial expression.<br /><br />Robert Patterson was a "passable" Edward. He maintains Edward's stoic and agonized behavior after meeting Bella. However, Edward of the novels is a larger-than-life presence with a restrained passion that is always teetering on the brink. Patterson falls short in his portrayal, leaving the viewer with a feeling that Edward is really nothing but a jerk. And the chemistry between Patterson and Stewart is...wait, there was none. I got the impression that they didn't even LIKE each other a majority of the time.<br /><br />As for the other actors, they were fairly true to the novel. Carlisle and Esme gave decent performances as loving and doting "parents." Rosalie's snide and pretentious behavior was right on the mark; Alice's sweetness, Jasper's restraint, even Emmett's teddy bear/jackal persona were all very believable. BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN THE MOVIE FOR TEN MINUTES TOTAL!!!<br /><br />Another disappointment was the holes that the movie left in the story. One of the key pieces in the first novel was the desire the high school boys felt for Bella. In hindsight I understand why the director chose to leave most of it out. NO ONE would believe that these boys would hone in on Ms. Stewart's lethargic and non-effectual Bella. On the plus side, the scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was pretty decent. I can only hope that with the change of director, and the fact that the studio has seen how popular the movies COULD be, they increase the budget and buy a new CGI team and get their lead actors some ACTING lessons. <br /><br />Finally, a note to Stephanie Meyer. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT allow Hollywood to continue to destroy the wonderful world you created.

Horrible
This movie is just plain silly.  Vampires hanging out in high school hitting on less than legal teenage girls?  The vampires all tried to dress semi cool/edgy see also as(homosexually.)  It's a trashy plotless, rehashed love novel with vampires of questionable sexual orientation.  If you like this crap you need to probably get out of the house more often.

Seriously?
<br />Before the rabid fans of Stephanie Meyer come for me and trash my first review on this website I would like to add an adendum. I am a twenty-two year old Undergrade, and I enjoy a little "brain popcorn" every so often. Warning! Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I labored over a decision to buy and read the Twilight series for weeks. After asking/begging for information over the series at my local B&N reading reviews here on Amazon, and my Library Patrons I decided to give it a try. I read Twilight and was hooked, I finished it in about 2 days and moved on to the next two in the series. Then, I labored over wether I should write a review of this book or not. Funny, the laborous process should have been my first hint.<br /><br />I want to ask Meyer, if she lost inspiration, had something traumatic happen, or just lose her drive to write these books? I was never interested in Edward as a character, or love intrest for Bella. By the time I finished New Moon I could care less about either of them and was just hoping Jacob would find a new, more interesting girl to suit him.<br /><br />Bella is uninteresting, incredibly Emo (and not in an artistic way), and so Co-Dependent that you just want to bash her head in so that you can be done with it. Watching her stumble, bumble and "live" without Edward is incredibly painful and embarassing just to read about, let alone be caught reading about in public. She is so disgustingly set on Edward and his disgusting, vapid, rather uninteresting and beautiful family that her own life gets put on hold.<br /><br />Perhaps if this book was written and released in the 80's, or prior to "Girl Power" this wouldn't be such an issue. But to market this kind of literature to a demographic is 13 to 20 year old Teens and Young Adults is just plain irresponsible! Sending the message that being incredibly selfish and leading someone on to deal with your own pain is both unforgiveable and sickening. The fact that Bella is so interesting in putting herself in harms way just to hear Edwards voice is just plain unbelievable at best and if you want me to believe that little miss "I don't want other people to realize that I exist" wants to cliff dive, I've got a bridge in Wichita to sell you. <br /><br />Don't get me started on the forced, horrible literary refrences to Romeo and Juliet. The analogies, allusions and personifications of people were enough to make me tear my hair out. <br /><br />So there you have it. If you're upwards of twenty something, read classic literature and/are a fan of the Bard, have self esteem and don't need a "man" to complete your life do not pick up these books and if you must, borrow from your local library.

quick....somebody get this girl a man!
As soon as I finished reading "New Moon" I wanted nothing more than to be able to contact Stephenie Meyers (a face-to-face interview would be preferable!) and ask what the hell she was thinking when she decided to make Bella Swan such a co-dependent, pathetic excuse for a character. I mean come on, its only so obvious that many young, impressionable girls are reading the "twilight" series and (god forbid) thinking that they need a man in their life or else there's nothing left to live for. And by the way, I know some of you are probably wondering why I've read not only "New Moon" but "Eclipse" as well, after writing a less than wonderful review for "Twilight" but ill get to that later. First, lets go over the basic plot of "New Moon" and ill tell you why I especially despise Bella in this book.<br /><br />At the beginning of "New Moon" Bella and Edward are happily in love (atleast as far as I can remember) until an unfortunate event happens during Bellas birthday party at the Cullens house, in which Edward realizes that his being near his dearly beloved puts her life in danger. So then.....*dramatic pause* Edward decides to leave, for Bellas own good (gasp!) and doesn't plan on ever coming back (oh no!) and worst of all, before leaving he acts as if he hates Bella and informs her that he no longer loves her (is it really so?!) for months afterwards, Bella turns into a catatonic headcase, barely able to function without her beautiful Edward around. She can't eat, can't listen to music, and can't even watch TV because something on it might remind her of Edward. (Rolls eyes) she makes pretty much no effort whatsoever to help herself and let her friends cheer her up, and she might have never recovered if not for....Jacob Black. Jacob Black, aka the werewolf (by the way, werewolves are enemies with the vampires which I just had to mention because I love how Bellas future best friend happens to be an enemy of the love of her life) Bella starts hanging out with Jacob more, and slowly starts to complain a little less about the "massive hole in her chest"....etc etc (skip ahead to the best parts) but of course Bella can't get Edward out of her head, especially when she realizes that she hears his voice when she is in danger, so then what does she do? Starts purposefully putting herself in ridiculously unecessary dangerous situation, even practically committing suicide just so she can hear his voice. Of course, the vampires find out and Alice Cullen informs Bella that Edward thinks that she is dead and so he decides that he no longer has a reason to live and decides to pay a little visit to Italy, in hopes that the volturi  will play a role in ending his life as a vampire. So of course Bella immediately hops on a plane to Italy, and of course gets there just in time to save Edward. And then of course he ends up going back with Bella, realizing that he can't bear to live without her....blah, blah, blah! (Oh and I do love Edward, atleast until I read Eclipse, so I'm not trying to diss him I just couldn't help but roll my eyes at his dramatics in this book)<br /><br />Ok, so now that I've finished with my summary of the book, here are some more things I'd like to add. Feel free to stop reading at anytime, really as I'm aware that I've written quite a lot already and I'm sure much of what I've said has probably angered many of you twilighters.<br /><br />first, let me start off by saying that I did understand Bellas depression in this book (I just can't believe the extremes that she took it to) after all, I'm 19 and I've had my heartbroken before. But come, practically going into a catatonic state for not just weeks, but months and months, because your boyfriend left you? (And yes I understand that its definitely not easy to get over someone, especially someone that you love. I know this takes quite a bit of time) and not even being able to watch TV? And not being able to function in general, until another guy comes along? (Yep another great message there, girls: remember that having a man in your life is the only thing that will make you happy!) and seriously... are we really supposed to believe that Edward no longer loves Bella? And better yet, are we really supposed to believe that Bella really believes that Edward no longer loves her? Please. And worst of all is the fact that Bella was intentionally hurting herself in order to simply hear Edwards voice. Yet ANOTHER great message for young girls (missing your man? go jump off a cliff and commit suicide and hopefully that'll get his attention! Life without him isn't worth living anyway!) and then there's the extreme and completely unecessary drama of Edward deciding to end his life over Bella, and Bella getting there just in time (but of course) to save his life! Now, I know I may be making a huge deal out of nothing, seeing as how this is just a book, but there are many books out there in which the characters go through so much worse (I.E. Losing a loved one to death or something of the nature) and none of them act half as bad and self-pitying as Bella Swan. Someone needs to give her a swift slap to the face and tell her to wake up and smell the sunshine and inform her that having a man isn't the most important thing in the world. Perhaps somebody should inform Mrs. Meyers about this as well. A bit harsh? Maybe, but reading these books just made me realize how much I hate reading about female characters with no backbone whatsoever. And really, I have nothing against Stephenie Meyers so don't get me wrong. I think she could be a very talented writer if she wanted to be (after all, I haven't met one person who has never heard of her book series) but I just don't agree with the way she portrays Bella (as you can tell) and I don't like the kind of message young girls will get because of that.<br /><br />And as I said, yes its true that I didn't like "twilight" and had no intention of finishing it, but my sister (who is a huge fan by the way) didn't understand how I couldn't like these books, and persuaded me to atleast finish the first one. So I did, and I came to the conclusion that the second half of the book was only slightly more interesting than the first. And was I the only one rooting for that vampire to kill Bella? And yes, even despite my dislike for "twilight" I still decided to read "new moon" because you know what I realized? These books are like a bad soap opera, something you don't necessarily like, but can't help but get caught up in it all, if only to laugh and say to yourself "seriously, why does everyone love this so much?"<br /><br />And just one more thing I'd like to add. I don't necessarily dislike "twilight" overall. Atleast not the idea of it. After all I like the cullen family, and the volturi are actually pretty interesting. I just think that Stephenie needs to make some HUGE changes with Bella (if only!) and add some events  of actual interest to the pages of "twilight" (instead of just Bella describing how beautiful Edward is every other paragraph) and then maybe ill have some nicer things to say about it all.

So You Want to Be A Vampire...
There are already alot of reviews for this book, but here's one more for you.  <br /><br />I bought it on a whim.  I did not like "Twilight" - I thought it was poorly written.  It had a romance that had no real flare or reason behind it, the heroine had a brain full of marbles.  And there was the ridiculous stuff - vampires playing baseball, glittering in daylight, etc.  <br /><br />Why did I get "New Moon" then?  Because it was at Wal Mart and I had run out of books and it was literally the only thing that seemed interesting.  I wasn't completely revulsed by "Twilight" so I thought I'd give her vampire world another chance.  <br /><br />And she blew it.  The breakup was ridiculous.  Bella leading Jake around as she did was irresponsible and completely horrible.  Of course she was hurting him and she knew it and did not care.  Bella is a selfish character in general, and a delusional one at that.  Despite the fact that Jake cared about her, she kept using him to force herself into more "dangerous" situations so she could "break her promise" and "even the score" to counter the promise that her vampire wannabe lover did not keep (that she supposed anyway).  So "dangerous" motorcycle riding (oh shock, that's the worst you can think of?) and cliff jumping come into play so she could hear Edward's voice (it came to her only to warn her of doing stupid things, which of course, made her want to do even more stupid things).  <br /><br />Trying to get into a situation with some potentially dangerous strangers hanging out in front of a bar, while she was out walking in a dangerous area WITH HER FRIEND was even worse.  Just so she could hear that voice and get her delusion fix.  They could have been attacked, raped, or worse.  <br /><br />The book gets stupider, just as Bella does.  Her relationship with her father makes her seem more like a 12 year old than an 18 year old legal adult.  Through it all I think the most disgusting part was this: Throughout the whole entire book - Bella is begging to become a vampire like Edward so they can be together forever (she is afraid Edward will leave her once she's over the age of 20 or something since he is "forever 17" and as long as she's human she will still age).  She manages to make a deal with "The Family" regarding the future state of her mortality after a particular set of circumstances.  This makes future issues become nonissues.  Edward is against this but says that he would help her along her road to immortality if she would  marry him first. <br /><br />Which she won't commit to. <br /><br />EXCUSE ME?<br /><br />You are willing to be bitten and changed by vampires to become an unsleeping, glittery-in-the-sun blood sucker for the rest of ETERNITY, and leave your parents and friends to rot and suffer without you, but you will NOT agree to marry the man that you *kept trying to kill yourself over just so you could hear his voice after he had faux dumped you?*.  The one you absolutely cannot live without?  Who gives you that freakin HOLE in your soul that we had to read about ten billion times while she ignored her friends and wallowed in self pity.  The heck?  <br /><br />I know the author may be trying to discourage young marriages, but that just smacks of ridiculousness.  I have no problems suspending disbelief for good fantasy takes on reality but its things like this that just blow it right out of context. It's also strange how attached she is to these people.  When her vampire-friend Alice showed up, she was hanging on to her so hard and being so obsessive and overflowing with love that I thought they would end up being a same sex couple before the book was over.  <br /><br />In short "New Moon" is implausible, ridiculous, emo in the whiniest way, and finishes with a clunking thud.  Character development is nonexistant, there is no sensual spark between Edward and Bella - just a creepy obsession, and thus leaves no reason left to read it.  Yet, I'm sure there are zillions out there that lap this up like its the best thing since sliced bread.

Meyers' books are GREAT....
...if you're an aspiring writer in need of a primer that gives never-ending examples of what NOT TO DO.<br /><br />I'm working on a teen fantasy novel of my own, and Meyers' Twilight series never fails to remind me of the things I want to completely avoid in my own writing.  Let's consult the list, shall we?<br /><br />1) THE BORING SUE HERIONE.  You may have heard of the Mary Sue, the perfect female protagonist who can do no wrong, who has unnatural beauty, who is beloved by all; Bella isn't quite a Mary Sue.  She's described (by herself, at least) as plain and is endlessly clumsy (though her clumsiness is so contrived that it seems like a magical Sue ability, practically).  She also has no interests, hobbies, or anything that she excels at in particular.  Despite these flaws, Bella nevertheless ends up a Sue because everyone loves her for reasons that defy explanation or logic.  Even when she is behaving in a selfish, whiny, and intolerable way, Bella is never called out for her behavior.  The only character who ever seems disgusted by Bella is Jessica, but since Jessica is written as a shrew anyway, we're clearly not meant to put much stock in her opinion. <br /><br />2) FATED TRUE LOVE.  In my world, Fated True Love isn't romantic, it's lazy.  It says "hey, instead of working out why these characters are attracted to each other and showing how their relationship develops, I'm gonna just put it in the hands of FATE and have them fall in love for no reason whatsoever!"  Edward loves Bella because she smells good, which means Edward loves Bella like I love freshly baked bread.  Bella loves Edward because he's beautiful.  God-like.  So beautiful...really BEAUTIFUL, in case you missed it in all the numerous descriptive reminders.  But really, why do they love each other?  I have no idea.  Shakespeare was all too aware of the ridiculousness of star-crossed love, which is why he was smart and killed his teenaged lovers off.  But Bella and Edward's happiness hinges entirely on their togetherness.  What a strong, solid message to send to the young women of the world: happiness isn't something you create for yourself, oh no, it's something you can ONLY find in a beautiful, immortal man.  Bella's slow recognition of Jacob as a potential suitor was far more interesting and realistic, and it was teeth-gnashingly disappointing to see Bella repeatedly insist to herself that no one would ever do it for her again but Edward.<br /><br />3) THE ZERO-HOUR PLOT.  Nothing much happens in Meyers' books, aside from Bella's enthrallment/suffering over Edward.  In the last few chapters, Meyers will attempt to inject some kind of conflict into the narrative, either in the form of James, Victoria, and Laurent ("Twilight") or the Volturi ("New Moon").  It's difficult to get invested in this conflict at the last minute, and again feels like a lazy, tacked-on, "oh right, I am writing a book, maybe something should happen!" move from the author. <br /><br />Of course, as someone who hopes to be successful at writing teen fantasy, it's depressing to know that all I would need to do to achieve this success is construct a BORING SUE HEROINE, a FATED TRUE LOVE, and a ZERO HOUR PLOT.  <br /><br />Or maybe it's not depressing...maybe it's an incredible relief!  After all, coming up with those three things shouldn't be too hard.  If a lazy writer like Meyers can do it, anyone can! <br /><br />For readers looking for good, solid teen-level fantasy featuring interesting heroines, more complex and realistic portrayals of love, and truly gripping plot, I recommend Diana Wynne Jones and Libba Bray.

Vapid Vampires finally get shunted aside, but all for naught.
In the first book Bella was dreamless, hobby-less, and hopeless.  Now she becomes a lush for adrenaline because her precious vampire boyfriend dumps her.  One can only wish she'd succeed instead of making the reader suffer along with her for 500 pages.  Bella's self-confidence and self-worth rest on the whims of a boy, and a vampire at that, and that's hardly a good message for any girl to take away from the book.  You get sick of hearing Bella whine about the hole in her chest.<br />The werewolves are actually decent, and one embellished the most also achieves what neither Bella nor Edward can: actual reader interest.  Jacob Black has a hobby!  He has some legitimate angst!  He is flawed!  And he and Bella actually have chemistry that goes beyond "You are my sun, my moon, my stars, my love!"  Jacob strikes me as the kind of guy one could actually LIVE with for the rest of one's existence, morning breath and all.  But don't expect Bella to actually LISTEN to any of this logic.<br />Perhaps more jaded sorts, such as myself, shouldn't read this.  I am not a romance reader; I'm a fantasy buff and a stickler for character logic.  I just kind of ended up in the wrong kind of territory.  It baffles me that shallow, blah characters like Eragon and this series can become bestsellers hand over fist.  I think in order for these books to work for me I'd have to believe in the happily-ever-after for these characters, and all I find myself thinking is "Okay, what are they going to DO for the rest of eternity?  Stroking each other's ego's over how beautiful they are would get really old really fast ..."

Agony For the Characters and For the Reader
Twilight was a good read (the first time, not so much the others) so I felt compelled to pick up this one and find out how our "star-crossed" lovers were doing. <br /><br />Instantly I was launched into a story of angst and Emo! to the extreme, cardboard cutouts, and plot-lackingness abound.<br /><br />For the majority of the story all Bella does is mope around and play with another boy's affections until Edward finally returns and it concludes with the decision of whether she is to become a vampire or not. In the end nobody goes home a better person and another long and drawn out chapter in the life of the Twilight saga has ended.<br /><br />I resisted throwing this book at the wall in disgust. Well written, my neck. On the topic of necks, I'm not betting my neck (or Bella's) that the next one will be any better.

I loved this story...
... Back when it was called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, literally a decade ago.  Let's think about this: girl moves to new town, finds mysterious boy who happens to be a vampire, they date against everyone's better judgement.  That's the first book, and coincidentally ("coincidentally"?) one of the main subplots of the first season of Buffy.  The temptation to suck blood having to be faced in order to save Bella's life from poison?  Angel needing the blood of a Slayer after being poisoned by Faith and having to take it from Buffy.  A bit flip-flopped, but still a parallel.  And now in this book, Edward abruptly breaks up with Bella and leaves town, stating that it's "For the best."  Last few episodes of season three, anyone?  Buffy starts going out with Riley, who turns out to be part of a special ops group dedicated to hunting demons, especially vampires.  Bella starts spending a lot of time with Jacob, who turns out to be a sworn enemy of vampires along with the rest of his werewolf pack... are you sensing a connection?<br />And it wasn't just the plot basically being lifted from Buffy that made this book nigh unreadable.  This is Bella's first boyfriend.  Supernatural or not, when your first boyfriend breaks up with you and you haven't even been going out a year, your life is not over.  You may think it is.  You may pout and cry and mope... for maybe a month.  Not six.  I have never known anybody to get *that* depressed for *that* long over their first boyfriend, no matter how much they said they were in love.  Bella wins the award for "Heroine you should never, EVER imitate," because first off she was absolutely useless as a person.  She forever had to have a man (be he werewolf, human or vampire) come rescue her from the latest scrap she got herself into, and secondly, watching her whine and thrash around in agony for literally three-hundred and fifty of the five hundred odd pages is the most pathetic thing I've ever read.  If they were real people, I'd say separation would do them a bit of good, because it is truly unhealthy to think you literally cannot live without a certain person.  They'd need time to figure out who they are without each other.  It also really bothered me that Bella could not mention Edward's name without saying how absolutely beautiful he was.  Every single sentence about him was coupled with that, and usually chased by her saying how klutzy or unremarkable or otherwise unworthy of her vampire boyfriend's affections.  To say it got old fast would be an understatment; it was absolutely pointless to begin with.  So skip this book.  It's not even good as a sleep-aide; you end up yelling at Bella to stop being so stupid.

"Whiny," "Emo," and "Pointless" come to mind.
This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />I'm curious as to why Meyer decided to create such a weak female protagonist.  While Bella may have irritated me for her clumsiness in Twilight, I was downright hoping for her demise in New Moon.  It's like Edward motivates every action and every thought of Bella's, as if the girl needs the boy to verify her very existence.  This is not a good lesson to pass on impressionable teenage girls.  What happened to the "We Can Do It" and "Girl Power" attitudes?  Bella is a puny excuse for a protagonist.  <br /><br />There were parts of the book I enjoyed, such as the birthday party.  Albeit Bella was irritating with her whining about turning 18--one year older than Edward, which bothers her so much although, curiously, she doesn't seem to care that she is two years older than Jacob, her "safe harbor"--and her ungrateful attitude toward those who care about her was sickening.  But what I liked about this scene was the presentation of the weaknesses of the Cullens, especially Jasper.  It was interesting to see that and finally added some substance to the story.<br /><br />However, I do think Edward is very much bi-polar.  In Twilight he was angry, rude, and emotionally abusive toward Bella.  In the beginning of New Moon, during the goodbye, he is indifferent.  At the end of the book, he is practically Fabio--so lovey-dovey that you wonder who the hell the real Edward is.  There is no consistency at all in this character.  <br /><br />I felt Jacob was the most intriguing of the main characters, but again Meyer cannot be consistent with character traits and personalities so she must completely change him after he undergoes "the change."  There is no trace left of that loveable Jacob.  He ends up becoming more like the first Edward--the angry one.<br /><br />Bella is also inconsistent.  In Twilight she faints at the sight/smell of someone pricking their finger, but in New Moon she gashes her forehead so much she's bleeding all over her face and clothes and needs several stitches, and yet she laughs it off as if it's nothing.  Huh?  And even though she longs to be bitten to spend an eternity with Edward, she downright refuses to honor his one request by marrying him first.  Again, scratching my head on that one.  What a moron.<br /><br />The first half of this book, minus the birthday party, is slow and there is much irrelevant material that I found myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the meat of the story.  Bella is so devastated by being broken up with that she lays down in the woods and can't get up.  She is practically unconscious and the whole town must go on a search looking for her.  Rock on girlfriend!  *rolls eyes*<br /><br />Once she finally sort of comes out of her grieving (months later), she goes on a suicidal rampage--although Meyer makes it clear every other chapter or so that Bella is not suicidal.  Actions speak louder than words, Ms. Meyer.  Apparently Meyer lost all inspiration and about halfway through writing the book she decided to do her own version of Romeo and Juliet.  It is so clear that this is her motivation that Bella assigns Jacob to the role of Paris and the climax of the novel surrounds Edward/Romeo's suicide attempt (which follows Bella/Juliet's suicide, of course).  <br /><br />During the climax I had high hopes for Bella.  I thought finally Meyer was going to give Bella some thick skin and SHE was going to do the saving for ONCE!  Eh, it was disappointing.  Bella may have literally ran into Edward, which did save him from committing a vampire version of suicide-by-cop, but for nearly the rest of the book she is so weak, "dead on her feet," and swooning in Edward's arms that she's useless.  The girl is a whiny emo drama queen with no self-confidence.  She is utterly pathetic.  It saddens me to think that girls today are looking up to this character as a role model.  In my opinion, Bella may very well be THE worst female protagonist in literary history.<br />

Where have all the feminists gone?
After reading TWILIGHT, I hoped Bella might grow a backbone. But no. She goes from too stupid to live to "shouldn't she have died fifty pages ago?" I skimmed ahead and found her riding motorcycles too fast, leaping off cliffs, etc. just so she can hear Edward's voice in her head. I obviously share no damsel-in-distress fantasies.<br /> <br />As in the previous book, Edward and the rest of the vampires are far too perfect for me to even faintly imagine they could ever be real. They're immortal, strong, fast, beautiful, telepathic, and gee! They sparkle, too. Why don't they have any flaws? Why should I care what happens to any of them? The werewolves seem like yet more excessively powerful males to rescue Bella. I don't like the gigantic rage-driven wolf concept, either. It seems too Hollywood. I do, however, like the use of Native American skinwalker legends.<br /> <br />Disclaimer: I never read the last fifty or so pages of the book because I chucked it aside.

The Vampires May Glittler, but it's only Skin Deep
This book perturbed me. A lot. Though I did enjoy Ms. Meyer's first installation of this series very much (even though the vampires glitter. go figure.) this one fell quite short of even being engaging. The Fault line? The protagonist. Where in Twilight Bella is her own person, intelligent, competent and refreshingly mature for her age, in New Moon she is selfish, codependent, bored, boring, stupid, irrational and just all around irritating. Instead of being someone who makes things happen, most of the book's major events transpire as a result of Bella's odd gravitational pull for danger. This gets old. Very old. Mostly, it is Bella's irreverent and irate actions that pull the story down and drown the reader. After a certain event (avoiding spoilers here) near the start of the book, Bella simply dissolves into a puddle of pathetic mush. Why should I give a hoot about her if she doesn't even give a hoot about her?? Never once did I feel an ounce of pity for her. Truthfully, she had more than enough for herself. Get a grip Bella! Pick yourself up! Be a strong character! DO something for crying out loud! <br />    If I could smack her, I would. <br /><br /> P.S. <br />    This book's saving grace was Jacob Black, the only character I could sympathize with. Don't worry Jacob, you're not missing much...

Plot Sypnosis
Do you remember when you were a teenager and your first real boyfriend left you? You know, when you went suicidal and started doing things that were very hazardous to your health? Well, that's exactly how painful reading this book was.

Shoot me, shoot me now *spoilers*
You end the book hating the character of Bella more then you could have ever thought possible. She comes off as two things throughout the book. First a bit of a bitch to one her father, for ignoring him for months then running off to Italy with only a note to tell him where she is. Also for obviously jerking Jacob around by his heart strings throughout the book.<br /><br />The second thing? She comes off as very much not in her right mind. She goes catatonic for a week and into a zombie trance for months because Edward left her. I'm sorry I refuse to believe one's soul mate leaving them would warrant a reaction like that. She's obsessive about Edward to a degree that if it weren't for the fact he's equally as obsessed, we would have a set of psychotic stalkers on our hands. Instead it's true love, ain't that just the most darling message?<br /><br />Edward comes off as a dick for leaving Bella, who is very much not in her right mind (she goes catatonic for a week then goes zombie trance for months?), and honestly seems very suicidal. He constantly tosses around the idea of suicide so much and how he's going as soon as she goes, you get the idea that he's going to cut her brakes, just so he can off himself.<br /><br />Any actual plot was procrastinated off to the very end, when Alice deus ex machina's in and tells Bella about suicidal Edward. Then it's off to Italy, a narrow save of Edward (who could have seen that coming?), and the Volturi lovingly shoving it down our throats that Bella is the most special snowflake of the lot.<br /><br />And I very much appreciated the Romeo and Juliet comparisons being shoved down my throat every other chapter. Ms. Meyer, I'm sure you've read it (because Bella is so obviously a young Mary-Sue version of yourself), the main things I took away was a cautionary tale of feuding and how it will destroy what you care for most.I never saw the true love of the play, and it always seemed like a plot point more then anything, for the rest of a more interesting story to go off of. Hey maybe New Moon is more like it then I thought... except with the lacking of a more interesting story.<br /><br />In review what does her brand of true love tells us what? You can't live without your man. It's perfectly okay to drop entire lives for someone you love. It's perfectly okay to commit suicide just to hear your ex's voice. It's perfectly okay to go comatose because you where dumped. <br /><br /><br />I only have one question after being forced to read this book. Why. Ms. Meyer, Why?

Co-dependent Bella: Act II
Anyone who enjoyed the first book but found the phrasing repetitive and the character of Bella to be mildly annoying, be warned.  <br /><br />Pgs 1-70 are actually interesting, aside from Bella being a brat about turning 18<br /><br />Pgs 70-400 are basically the plot of the first book, recycled, with Jacob as the new love interest.  As with Edward, she shuns the other kids at school, wants to spend all her time with him, and, when she finds out what he really is, she embraces it, meets the family...etc etc.<br /><br />pgs 400-the end are essentially the only novelty to the book.  Even so, it's ruined by the fact that Bella is so helpless and insecure.  I don't understand why Edward loves you either, Bella, but he does.  And I don't want to have to read 500 pages of him convincing you of that.<br /><br />This book is basically ACT II of the first book, but with a few less obnoxious descriptions of Edward's bronze hair/marble body/topaz eyes, and a few more obnoxious descriptions of the aching hole/depression in Bella's soul when Edward leaves her.<br /><br />Bella morphs from being slightly annoying and whiny, to being completely pathetic.  Her world revolves around Edward, so when he leaves, she is left in a catatonic state...until eventually she decides to rebel and do crazy things, in the hopes that she might hear his voice (oh yes, that velvet voice of his is in this book too, and velvet must be on Meyer's 'favorite adjectives list").  <br /><br />But then Bella finds reason for living again, in the arms of another man, Jacob.  Her basic attraction to him is based on...wait for it..."she's less miserable with him".  Hmmm....the co-dependent latches on again.  She completely leads him on, because the whole time she is with him, she is still thinking about Edward and how she can reunite her crazy messed up head with a precious delusion of him.  <br /><br />In the end, Edward and Jacob are mortal enemies (oh no!) and Bella is left choosing between the man who is the world to her, and the man who is the world to her when the man who really is the world to her is unavailable.  Gee, I wonder who she'll choose in the end.  Apparently Meyer wants us to think it's a toss up and plans to make another book of it.  Yeah right.<br /><br />I can only hope that the third book doesn't contain the following phrases and/or words, because I HATE THEM BY NOW:<br /><br />grimaced<br />smirked<br />topaz<br />velvet voice<br />touseled bronze hair<br />marble slab<br />perfect face<br />singing laughter<br />aching hole<br />russett skin<br />angelic anything<br />it felt like I was dreaming<br />I wasn't sure if it was a dream<br />it had to be a dream<br /><br />

Don't Wind Up as a Victim-eey Love Addict~Go to College Instead!
I just finished this book, granted I am 53 years old.  But, why is a teenaged girl encouraged to spent her life worrying about boys.  Boys come and go, even the vampire and werewolf kind.  A college degree will stay with you.  No one can really save you other than yourself!  I was JUST like this poor fool, Bella in my early 20's.  It has taken me decades to figure out the truth of life, and a girl's salvation ain't in a boy!<br /><br />  Please.....there is more to life than losing yourself for eternity to a boy. <br /> Buy real estate if you want to really be secure. This book is STRICTLY for the pre-teen/young teen crowd. It is not written above a 15 year old reader's level.  I found it trite  alot of the time.    Hope the film is funner......

Chinese Water Torture and Editors
Wow... the first one was at least good to read the first time, but this just sucked. <br /><br />I'm the kind of girl who hated Romeo and Juliet. I hated the way they committed suicide over each other, and how Juliet picked Romeo over actually having a life even though being with Romeo meant suicide. Therefore, it's not to hard to figure out that I wasn't all too fond of this.<br /><br />I actually don't know who I pity more: me, for reading this book when Chinese water torture might have been preferable, the editor for having to fix it from whatever level of absolute hopelessness it was in to the level of suckiness that it became, or Bella whose love left her (a sign to get over them to anyone reading this- don't wallow over some idiot) and was adament about their inexistent future together in the first place. Hm. Real tuffie. I don't know if me or the editor had it worse. <br /><br />What about Bella? Who cares, she was an idiot. <br /><br />And if love makes people fools, then it's not all its cracked up to be and I'm fine being single.

Romeo and Juliet Wannabes
throught 90% of the book I wanted to grab Bella by the sholders, shake her, and scream "Stop complaining!" She's a weak character and such a crybaby. Edward is little better. The few enjoyable characters in this book were Alice and Jake. But how can I like a book when I hate the two main characters? Grr.. I'm just sorry I wasted my time.

What happened to Bella?
I really enjoyed the 1st book. Bella was such a quirky fun character and I'm sure many people could relate to her. I was looking forward to reading more about her adventures with Edward. I was very disappointed by how Bella turned out in New Moon. She spends the entire book a mess. Bella was so strong in Twilight, and in New Moon she is just this shell that can't function without Edward. She resorts to trying to do dangerous sports hoping that she might hear Edward's voice. (Apparently her only reason for living.) She is being continually saved by Jacob. Her entire personality is reduced to a damsel in distress. Bella is a terrible role model.<br />I didn't find it romantic just annoying.

Not worth the hype
Cliched characters, not a very good story, vampires that sparkle in the sunlight, horrible writing...<br />...Man, I thought I was reading the first one all over again, and then I realized it was actually worse.<br /><br /><br />Maybe the author wouldn't be too bad if she stopped writing bad self-insert novels.<br /><br />I have no idea why people like these so much. Maybe they have never read a good book.

Not  Worth Your Time
Written as the sequel to Twilight, New Moon is just as disappointing as its predecessor.   Bella Swan is madly in love with a vampire named Edward.  As in the last book, she discovers that being in love with a vampire puts her life in constant jeopardy. However, she doesn't care and actually endangers her life, and hurts the people that love her, just to hear Edward's imaginary voice.  Most of the book focuses on Bella's obsession with Edward and her inability to live life without him.  If this relationship existed in real life we would label it as dysfunctional and unhealthy-- Bella is in serious need of psychiatric help.  The only character with any depth is Jacob Black, Bella's best friend.  At times, he livens up the story line and makes it a bit more interesting.   <br /><br />I decided to read this book, because I thought Twilight had the potential of becoming a good series.  I wanted to see if the author developed the characters enough to make them interesting, and expanded the story line.  Unfortunately, readers as stuck with a self-centered character involved in a dysfunctional relationship.  Hopefully, teens reading this book won't confuse this with true love.

Mothers: Please, please PLEASE do not buy this book for your daughters!
I am a voracious (but relatively non-critical) reader. I read for the joy of it- so if a book is well written with thoughtfully developed characters then I am satisfied. That being said, it will hardly surprise you that I rarely feel compelled to write a review. This is one exception. I read Ms. Meyer's first book "Twighlight" and enjoyed it. A week or two later I, picked up "New Moon" - and was shocked and dismayed at the stereotypical, self-destructive behavior condoned by this second book. <br /><br />It was so striking, and so distressing that I actually grabbed pen and paper to jot down some specific examples:<br /><br />In the first book, Belle is making adult decisions beyond her years. She decides to relocate to another state to live with her father in order to give her newly re-married mother time alone with the new husband. She copes admirably with the challenges of being "the new kid" at school and is not afraid to speak her mind or build friendships on her own terms. She is well read and excels in her studies at school. So far, so good...<br /><br />In the second book, "New Moon", Bella turns into a completely different character: <br /><br />* Edward (the romantic interest introduced in the first book) doesn't bring his car to school and automatically assumes he has the right to drive Belle's car. Belle makes no real objection. (Is there some unwritten rule that says when men and women go somewhere the man must drive the car? I certainly do not want my teenage daughter to think it's expected that any boy that she is dating has the right to commandeer her car.)<br />* Edward leaves Belle "for her own good". (When will we realize that, as women, we are as qualified as men--if not more so--to recognize what is `good' for us? I certainly do not want my teenage daughter to rely on hormone-driven young men to determine what is good for her.)<br />* After Edward leaves, Belle falls apart. She is alternately semi-hysterical and semi-suicidal. She is depressed, ignoring all other relationships -- clearly identifying girlfriends and friendship as a distant second to `boyfriends'. (First love is always hard --as is the second and third --but how about some perspective? Maybe by promoting a little healthy anger instead normalizing self destructive behavior? I want my daughter to know that if he makes you feel THAT BAD he really, really, REALLY isn't worth it...")<br />* Because Edward has left her, Bella decides to restore a dilapidated motorcycle because she knows her parents and Edward would disapprove of her driving a motorcycle (I will not even make the correlation between the parents' role and Edward's role as I feel this is obvious). However, instead of taking charge of this project- learning how to repair a motorcycle herself - she brings the bike to a young man who is obviously attracted to her. She trades on his interest for his skill as a mechanic. She does not help with any of the repairs, nor does she take any interest in learning these new skills.  (I don't want my daughter to think it's standard operating procedure to rely on male attraction to reach her goals - or that an interest in mechanics is the sole provenance of men)<br /><br />I could (obviously) go on and on and on...but I won't. There are already 592 reviews of this book - I can only hope that this is one that will be read by both mothers, daughters, and the author.<br />

Much ado about nothing
The only people on earth who are allowed to sparkle are as follows...<br /><br />1) Drag Queens. A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug.<br /><br />2) David Bowie. Need I say more?<br /><br />Someone needs to explain the why's and wherefore's of this whole "sparkly vampire" business to me. I really don't understand it at all. Going out in daylight... OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles?<br /><br />Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroghly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick)<br /><br />As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren't any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn't any drama. This is a vampire movie with no caonflict among the main characters. Only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing's really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn't have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment "the new girl." <br /><br />Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella's sheriff dad and the "maulings" (read: vampire attacks) he's investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward's wangsting.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There's one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn't paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I'm sorry, but that's just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don't care if the poor guy is a bit character, I'd rather a small look at any if the bit characters' small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film.<br /><br />Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the "OMG bad vampires." I'll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I'm told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them.<br /><br />As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villain's aren't developed at all. They are clearly "OMG EVOL!!!1!!" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn't terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend Twilight to anyone. No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper.

Is this what love is supposed to be?
This is one of the most frightening displays of romance I've ever seen in my life.  This is NOT a love story.  Edward (male protagonist)is obsessive to the point of restraining order.  He watches her sleep, follows her everywhere and is only interested because this is the one persons mind he cannot read.  Bella (female protagonist) is about intriguing as a candy bar wrapper (an empty one at that).  <br /><br />Since I've read the books (occupational hazards of a librarian) I know this only gets worse.  In a world of quality young adult literature where relationships are often shown as fleeting and impermanent, this story should not have been published let alone made into a movie.<br /><br />After reading/viewing anything I have to ask: what's the point? In this instance I cannot come up with anything.  What is this book/movie trying to say about relationships?  Because this is scary, obsessed love, not fulfilling, lasting love.<br /><br />P.S. Why do recent authors think they have personal license to change vampire lore?

Atrocious in a thoroughly enjoyable way
I can't recall the last time I had this much FUN with a poorly-made movie. I honestly can't decide whether I want to give it 'one star' for how genuinely terrible it is, or 'five stars' for how enjoyable it was to be appalled by.<br /><br />It's a sort of tradition amongst my local friends and I to rent movies we fully expect to be bad and watch them together; often we're just bored and, by the time the ending credits roll, feeling that we just lost two hours of our lives that we shall never get back. This one, though, stands out as one of the greats. <br /><br />If you're new to the series, the premises is this: Bella Swan (yes, 'beautiful swan') moves from her arid Phoenix home to Forks, Washington, where she meets and falls in love with a dour and seemingly perpetually-nauseated boy named Edward Cullen. She soon discovers his secret - that he's a vampire! - by Googling "cold ones," a term she finds in a book of Native American mythology. One would expect that Googling this term would actually yield many pages pertaining to beer. Or maybe that's just me. Anyway, a very clingy and angst-ridden relationship ensues, and after playing baseball in a thunderstorm with Edward's family, Bella meets a nasty vampire named James, who immediately develops his own obsession with her.<br /><br />Unlike Edward, though, James wants to eat Bella. Really badly.<br /><br />Most of this takes place in the latter half of the movie. The first half is comprised mostly of Bella moping around her new town and exchanging silent stares with Edward.<br /><br />Ah, Edward.<br /><br />It gave me pleasure to discover exactly how much the lead actor, Robert Pattinson, despises Edward Cullun.<br /><br />"When I read it I was convinced Stephenie was convinced she was Bella and it was like it was a book that wasn't supposed to be published. It was like reading her sexual fantasy, especially when she said it was based on a dream and it was like, 'Oh I've had this dream about this really sexy guy,' and she just writes this book about it. Like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced, like, 'This woman is mad. She's completely mad and she's in love with her own fictional creation.' And sometimes you would feel uncomfortable reading this thing..." "...the more I read the script, the more I hated this guy."<br /><br />Edward Cullen has a completely inconsistent personality, and Pattinson solved this by playing him as, in his own words, "as a manic-depressive who hates himself."<br /><br />Now, I understand some preteen girls actually find Edward's various advances upon Bella to be romantic - like admitting to sneaking into her room to watch her sleep for months before he even made an attempt to be nice to her. I'm led to wonder how some fathers would feel if they knew their young daughters admired such qualities in future boyfriends. Personally I think Edward is downright creepy, but as Pattinson apparently meant to portray him this way, kudos to Mr. Pattinson!<br /><br />For Bella's part, she's an unabashed Mary Sue, with every male in town falling all over himself to befriend, date, or, in one scene, gang rape her. It's Edward, however, who wins her inexplicable devotion, mainly by following her around and saying things like, "We shouldn't be friends," or, "Stay away from me!" in a low menacing voice. <br /><br />By the end of the movie, after lots of heaving and sighing and rushed special-effects, we're meant to believe that the two are star-crossed lovers, though they seem more like an abusive relationship in the making. With the vampire James dispatched, Edward and Bella slaver over each other's necks at prom, and James' female companion Victoria slinks away in the backdrop, doubtlessly plotting mischief.<br /><br />There's also a sub-plot straight from the underwhelming "Underworld" series regarding a rivalry between werewolves and vampires, but it's barely touched on in this installment. <br /><br />I wonder, given his public slandering of the franchise, whether Mr. Pattinson will reprise his role as Edward in the next film. A part of me is looking forward to it.

The Few Strong Points Are Swallowed by the Overwhelming Campy Badness
I consider myself a Twilight fan. I love the books and since reading the first one have bought the other three the day they came out. I was extremely excited about the movie, and went to see it opening night. My first thought by the halfway point of the movie was: WHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS?!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Twilight: The Movie is a horrible, campy, tacky, CHEAP vampire story that swallows almost all of the power of the novels. The vampire special effects are even WORSE than "Queen of the Damned" (which is hard to achieve), and the "action" scenes were scripted, confusing, and in some cases pointless and lame.<br /><br />The acting was off and it was awful. Kristin Stewart was weak and ineffectual as Bella. She portrays none of Bella's strengths and instead presents her as, essentially, a weakling, a coward and a whiner. Rob Pattinson's Edward is kind of creepy, kind of tacky, and completely unromantic; in fact, he's kind of off-putting. None of the Cullens act like they're supposed to except Rosalie and Alice, so of course they only got about five lines each in the entire movie.<br /><br />The worst acting choice was whoever played Charlie -- he's a dead fish in the entire movie. He never displays ANY emotion. Now, in the books Charlie IS kind of closed-off, but he DOES get upset -- like when Bella says she's running away, for instance. In the movie, he's quiet and unmoved and seems to say nothing but "Oh, my daughter's running away. Don't go, Bella. Please stay, Bella. Wonder what's on TV?"<br /><br />However, first and foremost, the love story element was RUINED by the script. Bella and Edward are awkward as can be together, and at one point Edward makes the cryptic comment "It would be better for you if we weren't friends." Now, at this point in the movie, he's been nothing but a supreme jerk to Bella at every turn. If I were Bella, my response would have been: 'What?! We AREN'T friends! You're a creeper and you need to go before I call the cops! Stranger danger! [Makes sign of the cross]'<br /><br />By the time they're 'together' as a couple it feels so rushed and unnatural that you have to gag at some of Bella's more romantic thoughts, which make perfect sense in the book. One of the worst mistakes they made was combining about five different important scenes and shortening them into one confusing scene: the meadow scene, combined with the first running scene, combined with the skipping class scene, combined with three other minor scenes. It was rushed, confusing, creepy, unromantic, weird, badly acted, badly shot, and badly directed.<br /><br />The dynamic of Bella and Edward was ruined -- Edward is supposed to be so supremely larger than life to Bella; for instance, in the book when he runs (he's supposed to look like a blur, which the movie of course killed off right away) with Bella the first time she's violently ill and can't stand for a moment. In the movie she just hops off his back as if to say 'Alright, I do this all the time.'<br /><br />In the book, James, the villain, is actually rather terrifying. In the movie...okay, the actor is admittedly very attractive. But -- have you ever seen the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (NOT the show, because the show was amazing; the movie was awful)? You know, where Rutger Hauer played the most CAMPY, RIDICULOUS vampire EVER? Well, James almost TOPS his performance in "Buffy" -- again, VERY hard to achieve.<br /><br />Another point of unintended comedy? Bella and Edward spend half the friggin' movie in a TREE. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. He calls her "spider monkey," for the love of GOD. It's SILLY! And then when the Cullens jump at the 'bad vampires'? It looks like they're about to perform the song and dance "fight" in the first scene of "West Side Story!" How utterly absurd!<br /><br />The casting was awful, the acting was awful, the script was awful, the special effects were AWFUL. Possibly the only good points about this movie was the first five minutes, which actually did a very good job for some strange reason, and the last five minutes, which also did a very good job, for some strange reason. Every other minute of the movie was excruciating in its mediocrity.<br /><br />I pray to God every day that people don't watch this D-Grade piece of CRAP movie and go away thinking to themselves, "Well, now I KNOW I'll never read 'Twilight' after watching THAT crap."

Twilight of the Vampire Romance
I have to believe Twilight was the most talked-about film of 2008 in the science-fiction/fantasy community. When it hit DVD, I was anxious to see it. An hour into the film, however, I was fighting the urge to turn it off and toss the disc into the trash. How is it that this unoriginal, glacially-paced, staggeringly emotionless film has such a large fan following? I can only presume that because I'm not a young girl keeping a weepy self-indulgent diary, and therefore fall outside of the target demographic, I just don't "get it."<br /><br />My wife has read all the books five times, and was even more anxious than I to see the film, but she literally walked out of the room halfway through, never to see the end, complaining that the film version had "ruined" every single aspect of the books (though these ideas are so threadbare, I personally don't even see how the books could have been better). Naturally, a movie has to change things  --  it's a different medium from literature - but my wife assures me that the changes were arbitrary and ruinous. She also assured me that the main male character, who we both thought was terrible, was not coming across as the super-mega-hunk everyone says he is. So it's not just because I'm a guy that I thought he was flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />It's a plot point that there's little sunlight in this film, but after an hour of watching this overly blue-toned movie, you just start feeling ill. There are no flesh tones; everyone is blue and sickly-looking. It starts to wear on you. The main character looks like they magic-marker'd his eyebrows in.<br /><br />As to the plot... what plot? Listen, folks... vampire romances have been done to absolute death by now. Everything in this film, we have seen before, either through Near Dark, Forever Knight, Anne Rice novels, or even Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The brooding James-Deanish vampire love interest has passed deeply into cliché (Angel did it better, but I even thought it was getting old ten years ago). About the only thing "new" here is the idea that vampires actually look "beautiful" in their true appearance, yet on my big flat screen, what the main female character was oohing & ahhing about looked more like slimy snakeskin than diamonds, so even at THAT level, I was out of sync.<br /><br />Anyone buying or renting this film has SOME idea of what it's about, even if just from the movie poster. And yet it takes the film a full hour to get us there. We've seen this and seen it... you can hurry along to the big "reveal" and get the actual PLOT moving, please. But even when it starts to move... well... we've seen that too!<br /><br />I really do not understand what magic this film holds for people, but if you haven't seen this yet, you too are probably not among its target audience. So save yourself and give Twilight a pass. It's a tired old derivative idea presented in a stunningly boring package, with a whole cast of young, unlikeable, blue-skinned people.<br />

Sorely disappointed...
While I am not among the core demographic that this movie was targeted for, I am an enormous fan of the Twilight books. So I was more than thrilled to learn that a movie was being adapted out of them. Always one of the mind that "book is always better than the movie," I didn't have huge expectations given the budget and director. Even my lowered expectations were not prepared for the monstrocity that appeared on the screen. For 120 minutes, I watched a wooden cast run through the motions of the script. Kristen Stewart could not have been worse. Bella is a warm and charmingly clumsy young woman. Although in the books, she appears aloof at times, she loves fiercely and with all her heart. Ms. Stewart never even came close to any of those emotions except the aloofness. Her stilted portrayal of Bella was heart-breaking to watch. Even when she was being tortured by James, she barely managed a facial expression.<br /><br />Robert Patterson was a "passable" Edward. He maintains Edward's stoic and agonized behavior after meeting Bella. However, Edward of the novels is a larger-than-life presence with a restrained passion that is always teetering on the brink. Patterson falls short in his portrayal, leaving the viewer with a feeling that Edward is really nothing but a jerk. And the chemistry between Patterson and Stewart is...wait, there was none. I got the impression that they didn't even LIKE each other a majority of the time.<br /><br />As for the other actors, they were fairly true to the novel. Carlisle and Esme gave decent performances as loving and doting "parents." Rosalie's snide and pretentious behavior was right on the mark; Alice's sweetness, Jasper's restraint, even Emmett's teddy bear/jackal persona were all very believable. BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN THE MOVIE FOR TEN MINUTES TOTAL!!!<br /><br />Another disappointment was the holes that the movie left in the story. One of the key pieces in the first novel was the desire the high school boys felt for Bella. In hindsight I understand why the director chose to leave most of it out. NO ONE would believe that these boys would hone in on Ms. Stewart's lethargic and non-effectual Bella. On the plus side, the scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was pretty decent. I can only hope that with the change of director, and the fact that the studio has seen how popular the movies COULD be, they increase the budget and buy a new CGI team and get their lead actors some ACTING lessons. <br /><br />Finally, a note to Stephanie Meyer. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT allow Hollywood to continue to destroy the wonderful world you created.

Horrible
This movie is just plain silly.  Vampires hanging out in high school hitting on less than legal teenage girls?  The vampires all tried to dress semi cool/edgy see also as(homosexually.)  It's a trashy plotless, rehashed love novel with vampires of questionable sexual orientation.  If you like this crap you need to probably get out of the house more often.

HORRIBLE GOT RROD IN A FEW MONTHS!
Well I bought this when it was still new and not refurbished. I was always scared of the red ring of death so i took extra care of my 360. I put it on a box since there was carpeting bought a hand held vacuum to take out all the dust and a cooler that did not take 360 power... It had it's own power cord. A wireless adapter play and charge kits 3 mics ( which broke extremely fast and I take such good care of my things) two controllers also two cod waw discs because my 360 scratched one of my discs. add that up and look at the cost. 20 (cooler)+ 100 (adapter)+ 20 (play n charge kit)+ 120 (3 mics)+ 100 (to cod discs) + 120 (controllers which SUCK!) = 480+ 200 for the console = 680. As for the PS3 which in my opinion is a better system look at the difference in pricing. 300 (console) + 30 (wired headset)= 330. Thats all I've spent on my PS3 only which i got after my 360 broke. Also the PS3 uses 3rd party hard drives. You could upgrade to 500 GB for $50 if I wanted to. It comes with an over sized hard drive so why bother? Now here are the pros and cons of 360 and PS3.<br />   <br /> XBOX 360<br />Pros: <br />Some exclusives<br />Less laggy online<br />Better dashboard<br />Avatars (which is just a copy of wii) <br /><br />Cons:<br />Most games are rubbish<br />Worse graphics<br />No blue ray <br />Red ring of death<br />No built in wifi<br />No third party headsets<br />Most single player games aren't even worth playing<br />Stupid xbox live market place<br />Breaks discs when moved while on<br /> As you can see which has more?<br /><br />PS3<br />Pros: <br />Blu ray<br />free online<br />better graphics<br />no Microsoft points just dollars<br />you can buy games with a psn card instead of a credit card<br />no rrod<br />1% failure rate!<br />controller batteries come rechargeable<br />Dual shock 3<br />easier PlayStation store <br />playstation home :D<br />Better exclusives<br /><br />Cons:<br />YLOD<br />non user friendly dash board<br />PSN is a little laggy<br /> Over all which is better?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />      <br />

Defective
Whatever you do, do not buy the refurbished Xbox Pro from Amazon. You would be much better off buying a new Xbox Arcade. My Xbox arrived with a broken power supply and I had to rebox the entire system and pack it up. Way too much hassle for a broken product when you can buy a functional Xbox for only a few dollars more.

Red Ring
First of all, they sent the XBox to the wrong person. they did fix this, but it took longer to get here. next i opened and was ecstatic, until i saw 3 out of 4 little red lights come on. i hope they will resolve this too, but until this happens i am giving them a bad review.

dont waste your money
I honestly was not really that impressed with this. It will only charge your battery if you actually have the xbox on. Go with the quick charger instead and keep your controller wireless.

Will not work
I cannot get the thing to hold a charge at all.  I have left this plugged into the xbox forever and as soon as I unplug it, the controller dies.  I give up and will continue to just use real batteries.

Beware of compatiblity issues
I have a D-Link DI-524 revision E 5.1 Firmware.  For some reason or another, the wireless adapter refuses to connect to the DI-524 E.  I don't see any entries on the router.  It seems that the Wireless Adapter can easily find the network, but I cannot successfully connect.  I've tried using WPA and WEP, but with no success.  I ended up giving up and returning the adapter.  The DI-524 is on the compatibility list, but only for certain firmwares [which means, certain revision].  The latest revision of the DI-524 doesn't seem to be compatible with the XBOX 360 Wireless Adapter.  I even have a Zonet wireless adapter for my laptop, and it connected to the router fine.  I would suggest reading the fine print carefully about what routers are compatible to the wireless adapter.  Having a newer firmware doesn't necessarily guarantee compatibility.

Overpriced Garbage
Save your Cash! This device is overpriced. I bought it under protest but read so many good reviews about the ease of use and functionality that I went forward with it...Well I should have known better this device does not work bottom line. I have used it for 3 weeks it reads 3 bars every where in my house including my bedroom not ten feet away from the router. Yet still kicks me off of xbox live every other time I go into matchmaking. There are cheaper alternatives, Whats the point of paying 100 dollars for something that doesn't function as well as any of my other wireless adaptors at half the price. I just bought a 100 ft cat5 cable  for 18 dollars just so I wont have to deal with this rip off of a device. Unless you are right next to your router don't waste your money. Actually just buy something else its an inferior product to everything out there...thanks Microsoft. There is just no excuse for such a price on an item that cant work half as good as my laptop adaptors and is intended for gaming, you've been warned.<br />

Not worth the money
Yes, it works. Yes, it's easy to install. But the reality is that Microsoft is charging far too much for the functionality. It works so seamlessly because the hardware itself was already designed for WiFi. You're essentially spending $100 for an antenna--which is inexcusable considering WiFi PC cards cost $20. Even the Nintendo DS comes with WiFi, and that's $129 for the whole game system.<br /><br />In short, this is never worth buying new. If you just have to buy this thing new, get it from online auctions, where it usually costs $60. Otherwise steer clear from this transparent example of Microsoft greed.

there is an AFTERMARKET product for 50 dollars less!
Belkin brand wireless G gaming adapter!  I went to walmart to get the Xbox brand wireless adapter and they were sold out.  I was about to go to Best buy and saw this on the shelf.  Its in a red and silver/grey box and works for the 360, Wii, PS2 and PS3!  hooks right up to the USB ports and I was online and wireless 5 minutes after getting home.  Its bigger than the Xbox brand, but you save $50, which is almost a new game.  I haven't had any problems and its compatible with tons of wireless routers.

If you have Verizon FIOS with an Actiontec MI424WR router, it probably won't work, my didn't. There are hundreds of simmlar experiences on-line. I should have done a Google search prior to buying.

UGH!!!! RECALIBRATION DRIVING US CRAZY!!!!
We bought the Resort Sports (which we love) and apparently the motion plus is a packaged deal.  We got one with the game and bought one separately.  <br /><br />The recalibration on this is driving us crazy.  There are some games (wakeboarding) that we (the adults) have to do it pretty often and others that we don't.  However, for our 5 year old, she has to recalibrate practically every minute.  She gets so frustrated and then doesn't even want to play.<br /><br />So, we just paid lots of extra bucks for a controller that makes our child (and occassionally us) not want to play the game.  Where is the logic in that!!!  With the regular Wii Sports golf game she had so much fun - with the new one she can't even play!<br /><br />We are so frustrated with wii right now!

Loses communication w/ console frequently
My wii remotes work perfectly ... that is until they are connected to motion plus.  The motion plus, while creating a slightly more realistic game playing experience for things like Tiger Woods 2010, causes sporadic loss of communication with the console.  This has the affect of making games unplayable.  I will be calling Nintendo ASAP.

Buggy?
I've had nothing but problems with this upgrade when combined with the Nunchuk.  I'm at a loss here....  The games in the Sports Resort look like they could be fun, if only we could play them.<br /><br />I have four controllers, and four motion plus add-ons, and three nunchuks.  (Obviously this limits us to three people for games that require the Nunchuk, which is fine.)  The problem is that only one of my Nunchuks works with the Motion Plus.  The other two work okay without the Motion Plus, and the Motion Pluses all work okay without the Nunchuks.  Combine them though, and only one works.  No good at all for three kids.  I've tried moving around the Motion Plus and Nunchuks, and it's very consistent.  The only Nunchuk that works correctly with the MotionPlus is the one that came with the game unit.<br />

Wii Remote + Shareware Quality Game = Overpiced Wii Remote
I highly advise against buying this.  Allow me to expalin...<br /><br />Let's lay out the facts: A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IMWK2G">Wii Remote Controller</a> on its own is $39.99.  This Wii Remote + Wii Play game is $49.99.  In essence, you are paying $39.99 for the Wii Remote and the remaining $10 for the game packed in.<br /><br />Since you could just buy the remote separately what you really need to know is: "If I want another Wii Remote, should I pay an extra $10 for the Wii Play game?"<br /><br />The answer is NO.<br /><br />The Wii Play game is a collection of mini games in the vein of Wii Sports.  The catch is that this time the games have far, far less appeal.    <br /><br />While we have logged countless hours on truly fun games like Wii Sports, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GEDN5E">Rayman Raving Rabbids</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LSJKAM">Mario Party 8</a>, it took my wife and I only about 20 minutes to play through the entire Wii Play collection and not a single mini-game left us wanting to play it again.  In fact, each game on Wii Play reminded me of cheesy freeware games you can download or play online at "cure for boredom" sites.<br /><br />If, after reading this, you are still just dying to try it, I say: Borrow it from a friend.  No friends have it?  Ask yourself why.  Then, if you STILL want to play it, go rent it.  Spend $5 on a rental and discover for yourself that Wii Play has no "Rii" Play value.

Game = $10 | Wiimote = $39.99 | Wii Play = $49.99... Why did I expect so much from the game?
At first glance, the Wii Play seems extremely appealing as you get a Wii remote AND a game consisting 9 mini games. However, to my disappoint and to many others, the games are just not worth it. I'd sell back my Wii Play with the remote to just get back my money but it's too much of a hassle. <br /><br />If you want the Wii remote don't buy this. You'll just waste $10 that you can save to buy a good game rather than the 9 mini game junk.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Don't Bother
Go get a controller and save your $10 dollars for something that will provide more than 10 minutes of enjoyment. The games are simplistic and repetitive and, for $10 dollars, you can go buy a used GameCube game to play on the Wii.

Wii is amazing, Wii play is not
Let me start by saying we love the Wii.  It was a Christmas gift and since then my husband, son and I have loved playing the Wii sports, we are hooked.  Which is why I purchased the Wii play.  I wanted an additional controller so we could play each other and I thought 9 other games for $10 was a great deal.  I was wrong.  Just buy the controller by itself.  Save the $10.  The 9 games that come with this pack are not fun and are limited and not worth the money.  We played them all the night we got them (just to try them out) and I doubt we'll play any of them again.  But we love the Wii!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Don't waste your money
As most people pointed out, it seems like a good deal at first.  Why pay just for the controller, when you can pay a little bit extra and get the game. (Un)Luckily, I got this game from a friend for free (who probably bought it for the controller).  Most of the games just don't work right.  If you want a fun game to play when friends come over Mario Kart or Wii Sports are much better options.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Just Buy the Wiimote
This pack of games would not have been impressive in 1980.  The cow racing is amusing for about 5 minutes and the rest are terrible.  Don't get talked into this unless you want to use the game disc as a mini-frisbee;  Just buy the wiimote by itself and buy a pizza with the extra $10 (with some extra toppings.)

What Was Sony Thinking?
Sony's new PSP Go is an update to the venerable PSP handheld gaming device. No doubt that it's a small sexy looking device but after giving it some thought I can't think of a single reason someone should get it.<br /><br />Aside from super sexy aesthetics what really differentiates the PSP Go from it's main competition (the Nintendo DS) is that it's an all digital device.  What does that mean?  Well, you no longer go to a physical store to buy games for the PSP Go because it doesn't have a slot for UMD games.  Like the iPhone it has an online store where you purchase and download all your games.  You'll be able to find PSP Mini games (smaller games that you'd find on the iPhone) as well as regular PSP games such as Gran Turismo.  Pretty cool huh?<br /><br />But think about this.  With a downloaded game, you can't share it with a friend without giving them your system.  Also you loose the ability to sell the game after you've finished it or realized that you actually hate the game and want to get back some of the cash you just wasted on it. So the only real benefit of an all digital system is that you get instant gratification.  See a game on the store you just have to play, pay, download and play.  That would be pretty cool except Sony botched up wireless service for the PSP Go.<br /><br />First off the PSP Go uses an old standard for wireless connectivity, 802.11b instead of the more recent and much faster g and n.  Why create a device that can only function wirelessly then use an outdated, slow standard?  But it doesn't end there.  Sony also designed the PSP Go so that if you are downloading a game and you loose the network connection for some reason (which tends to happen a lot more on the outdated b standard), the next time you connect the system doesn't pick up form where it left off but instead starts downloading all over again.  Insane!  It's not uncommon to hear reports of three hours download times for a single game.  Ouch!  And it's all because of the Sony is using older wi-fi technology.<br /><br />Why did Sony choose to make getting games such a pain in the neck?  Shouldn't this, the big selling point of the device, be quick, simple and painless?  I'd rather spend the three hours driving to a store, buying a game, getting home and playing it than just sitting around waiting for a download.  Oh did, I forget to mention that when the PSP Go is downloading you can't do anything else with the device?<br /><br />Aside from core functionality problems, there are other concerns.  Sony created a new proprietary connection cable for the PSP Go so all you previous PSP owners can't use any of the cables, or devices you have for the original system.  Controls are cramped and the system in uncomfortable to hold.  And of course to enjoy all the agony that the PSP Go offers you have to pay $250.  That's just $50 less than a PS3!  A Nintendo DSi is $170.  An iPod Touch is $199.  Why pay $250 when you can buy a PSP 3000 for $170 and it will do all the PSP Go does and more (like play UMD games and movies).<br /><br />It seems to me that the PSP Go will only appeal to blinded fan boys and gadget freaks.  Who else would want to deal with all the pain of ownership?

No significant new features; previous PSP models are more capable
Bottom line: Spend your money on a PSP-2000 or PSP-3000 plus a 8 or 16 GB memory stick (or just stick with your current PSP if you already have one). Aside from Bluetooth connectivity, the previous PSP models do everything the Go does, plus give you the option of playing UMD games and movies, plus work with the standard Mini USB transfer cable that you probably already have.<br /><br />Sony has put out some misleading advertising suggesting that downloading digital games from the PSN Store is a new feature unique to the Go, but every regular PSP can already do this. I really don't think this can be overstated: Every PSP can get online and download games in exactly the same way the Go can, and has been able to do so for a long time already. The Go does not even speed up transfers or allow downloads to run in the background. The functionality is exactly the same.<br /><br />(Note that while every piece of digital content playable on a PSP Go is also playable on the older PSP models, there are some UMD games that are not yet available on the PSN Store, and may never be. PSP Go owners are simply locked out of playing these games at all, in any form.)<br /><br />The PSP is a very impressive handheld system with a ton of great games already out, and many more promising games on the horizon. Sony's renewed focus on online content means that there has never been a better time to enter the PSP scene. Unfortunately, the Go is a botched release that is inferior to the previous PSP models in nearly every way.

Mission.... fail
I got the chance to play around with this thing without purchasing it, and I am glad I did not spend the $ 250. I am not quite sure what Sony was thinking when releasing this thing, but it was certainly not the customer who they had in mind. The Sony PSP was a great idea. The PSP go adds nothing new, yet gets rid of many of those things that made the PSP great. Here's what's new for the PSP GO:<br /><br />The good (new features)<br />1) Compact slider design (mind it does not come with a touch screen, which means it is unusable unless you slide it out)<br />2) 14GB of internal memory<br />3) Bluetooth<br />The bad<br />1) No support for UMD games and movies you may own. In other words, buy all your games again. You must now purchase all games from Sony for FULL retail price. Even those you already own.<br />2) No support for current PSP accessories. Wouldn't it be too nice to connect to the PC with a regular USB cable, as the PSP did? Sony thought so, inventing yet another proprietary cable.<br />3) New proprietary AC adapter. As if you did not have enough of them already.<br />4) Supports downloaded content ONLY. Yet, for some reason supports only the slow and ancient wireless-B standard. (and cannot do anything while downloading)<br />5) Screen has same resolution as the PSP and is smaller. <br />6) The regular PSP lets you change the battery, so you can replace it or carry a spare for long trips. As a new feature, the PSP Go has a non-replaceable battery, which conveniently turns it into a $ 250 paper weight in about 2-3 years.<br />7) Replaces the proprietary Memory Stick Duo with the even more obscure (and expensive) Memory Stuck Micro M2. <br /><br />All in all, why did Sony bring upon us this atrocity of a gaming system? You get much less for much more. You will pay arm and leg for downloadable games that will likely die when your PSPGo dies, so you can start over another time. Considering this thing works only with stuff directly from Sony, they should be giving it away for free or at a much lower price and make their money on digital downloads. Just buy the good old PSP 3000, which does EVERYTHING the PSP Go does (including playing downloaded content, except bluetooth), does many more things the PSP Go does not do (play UMD's, work with accessories, allow you to replace the battery, play custom content on the memory stick). Taking into consideration that the PSP Go uses pretty much the same hardware as the PSP 3000 (same processor, same wireless adapter), getting the Go for $ 100 more makes no sense at all.<br /><br /><br />

This product only has one demographic, and it's very narrow.  Garbage for everyone else.
The physical product itself is probably a two or three star rating.  I'm rating the entire package: the physical unit itself, Sony's (mis)handling of new products, how it compares to other similar devices (I left the DSi out to keep the focus on the PSP) and its impact on the future (small segment on this).  After play-testing one title from each genre on it, I can say this is a complete waste of Sony's development resources and consumers hard-earned cash.  I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.  A little Googling will allow people to find great deals on the 2000 and 3000 models, which have many more features than this unit and are much more affordable.  Recently, I purchased a new 3000 model for around $[...] with Ratchet and Clank.  Even here on Amazon, the other models are $[...] less expensive.<br /><br />Compared to the older models, let me list the positives:<br /><br />-Sliding screen<br />-Lightweight<br />-DualShock 3 Support for home use  <br /><br />By shooting down comparisons to the older units and other similar devices, everyone suckered into buying this are trying to defend their ridiculously overpriced purchase.  Unfortunately for them, most of the world that uses these devices don't live in a vacuum.  As critical consumers, we must compare this unit to older ones or other all-in-one media devices.  If Sony wants to try and play with the big boys (Apple, etc.), then they need to take the heat.  <br /><br />Here are the things I do not like about the system:<br /><br />For current PSP owners:<br /><br />-Currently, no custom firmware.  As of today, even the 3000 model can run some functions of custom firmware, but only up to an extent.<br />-All new accessories that can't be carried over from the older models.<br />-New card slot, which makes the old cards useless.<br />-In the US, there is no UMD trading program.  At the last minute, Sony shot this idea down.  At least, international customers got something, but it was still far from Sony's initial boasts.   <br /><br />Current PSP owners have no reason to 'upgrade.'  The price is too expensive to own a Go and another model.  If the unit was around $[...], then I would reconsider that stance.<br /><br />Negatives for everyone (including current PSP owners):<br /><br />-16 GB is not enough space to hold a lot of games, especially, the more popular titles.  <br />-Digital-only delivery service, which essentially creates rental licenses.<br />-The controls and playing games is more uncomfortable than ever.<br />-Without heavy-duty eyestrain, the smaller screen makes RPGs and racing games unplayable.<br />-Users must convert all videos to Sony's format, which was a problem on the older units.<br />-Without Media Go, the device cannot properly function with a PC.  I guess if people can live with garbage like Itunes, then this isn't a big deal.<br />-Same battery life as the previous model.<br />-WiFi is still too slow to be useful.<br />-BlueTooth is a novelty and not really useful.  On a specific site, an entire forum thread was posted about how useless the feature is for tethering to a cellphone.    <br />-No background downloads for games.<br />-Proprietary USB cable.  A lot of companies do this.  On the older PSP units, I was happy to plug in generic cables into them.  Now, people will have another device with its own cable.  ANNOYING. <br />***The slider could break.  I've never broken one, but I know a lot of clumsy people.<br /><br />Things that should have been added for the exorbitant price:<br /><br />-Dual analog nubs.  The right one would emulate the buttons.  This issue has been addressed by the custom mod community, which makes the lack of one completely unacceptable.<br />-WiFi 'G' or 'N': the WiFi is just too slow by today's standards. <br />-Touchscreen.  If Sony wanted to compete against other all-in-one products (which is their strategy, even though, it's half-heartedly executed), then this should have been a no brainer.  <br />-A UMD slot with the ability to digitally rip games in an encrypted format to the memory stick, just like, the XBOX 360 installing feature for its system.  <br />***The D-Pad could use a makeover.  I can't complain about this much because the design is Sony's signature.  Unfortunately, the design makes fighting games almost unplayable and plenty of sore thumbs.<br /><br />For this system, only one demographic exists: people who don't already own a PSP, were curiously interested in one before, don't care to actually own games and will not buy anything that is larger than a certain size (even though DSi's are still larger than this but nobody complains about those).  That's it.<br /><br />Sony wanted to create an all-in-one multimedia device that competes with Apple and other similar products.  Unfortunately, it does not have a touchscreen, which makes it fall way behind similar units.  There is no keypad, so internet use is still cumbersome.  The browser is still terrible.  Also, why do people need every device to do everything?  How many more of these devices can clutter our lives?  Sony should have actually increased the PSP's functionality to better play games, instead of, trying to compete with superior devices in the all-in-one market segment.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't recommend this product to anyone.  The last three or four years, Sony has had a terrible run.  They are scrambling to re-capture their lost customer base, but their efforts are placed in all the wrong areas.  Their PR department needs a huge overhaul.  Since the inception of the PS3, Sony canceling the UMD-trading program was the last decision in a long line of poor PR moves.  From the top down, I think the company itself needs GOOD fresh ideas.<br /><br />On a grander scale, Sony's success with this product can only lead to one thing: gradual degradation of game ownership rights, which have been withering away for years.  For those that feel this is inevitable, I feel sad for you all.  Why should we pay companies the same money to give up rights we had before?  What benefit do we receive?  None.  Next time, before purchasing a product like this, please think hard about it.  You are all buying into a "way-of-life" and not just a product.  <br /><br />Thus, I am giving this product and company a one-star rating.  I would give it no stars, but that's not possible.

Scatch my brand new PSP
I bought this item and the inside metal part of the case scratch the casing of my brand new PSP.  Really frustrated with this cheap case.<br /><br />Buy the official PSP case for 14.99 at target, looks nicer and not cheap.<br />
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
A few BIG and unexpected flaws...
Bought this case for my son's PSP 3000. It fits snug and is very durable; a little on the cheap side as quality goes, but I paid cheap. However, there is a metal clasp that is attached to the case, which is fine(although on the cheap side), but it is inexplicably attached directly to the case with a metal grommet that protrudes into the cradle that actually holds the PSP. This metal grommet makes contact witn the PSP every time it is in the case and has begun to leave scratches on the back of my sons PSP. They are small scratches and don't effect the way it operates, but my son was forced to move the PSP to the accessories cradle that is not quite as big and doesn't fit as nicely. Also, there was supposed to be a velcro strap that holds the the PSP in place when you open the case, but one of the straps was completely missing! So this too was useless. To sum up, I recently bought an officially licensed PSP Starter Kit with a (great!) case, car charger, cleaning cloth, USB cable, and extra UMD Cases, it even came with a bonus 'skin' for the PSP for only $15 at Sam's Club. My son loves it and uses the useless case to hold all his new accessories and attached it to the new case with the useless metal ring. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you intend to do the same. Although you could probably find a used or even new travel shaving or toiletry kit that would perform the same function . . . ?

Right side has already failed
I haven't even used these for a combined total of two hours and the right side is already dead. I get either complete silence or pure static. I didnt lay my head down while using them or anything. Even if these HAD worked as expected, they arent very confortable to wear, they mash up against the sides of my ears instead of truly fitting over them.<br /><br />Only buy these if you don't mind driving down to the post office to return them, AND your significant other is attracted to cauliflower ears.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />If one of your sides have failed, try BLASTING the volume for a moment. I normally keep my TV volue at about 50, but jamming it all the way to 99 forces the bad side of these headphones to start working. After it works, then turn volume down to your normal listening level. It still goes bad from time to time, but using this method has brought it back to working condition every time so far.

Uncomfortable; mediocre sound
My main headphones are Sennheiser HD-595's, but I started a job in an office where open headphones aren't acceptable due to the amount of noise they bleed into the room.  I needed to buy a pair of closed headphones, and decided to stick with Sennheiser since I was so happy with my 595's.<br /><br />I was going to buy the HD-280's until I read the reviews for the HD-202's and saw how incredibly positive they were for a pair of $25 headphones.  So I bought them.<br /><br />They arrived today and the first thing I noticed when I put them on was how incredibly tight they were.  I hoped that I was just so used to my 595's being exceptionally comfortable, and that I would get used to it after a few hours.  So I plugged them in and started listening.<br /><br />The sound is not bad, especially for such cheap head phones.  But it definitely isn't great either -- nowhere near what most people here are claiming.  And Sennheiser has made up for the lower sound quality by severely boosting the bass.  The result is a very boomy sound similar to what you get from Sony.  While some people like this sound, it's extremely unnatural, and in my opinion does not "fix" the lack of quality at other frequencies.<br /><br />After a few hours of listening and adjusting to the fit as well as the sound, I still found them incredibly uncomfortable.  They pinched my ears tightly against my glasses and I eventually got a headache.  I have tried supra-aural headphones before without the sort of discomfort I experienced while wearing these.  I never adjusted to the bass either.<br /><br />I'm returning them and buying a pair of HD-280's.

PRODUCT HAS DEFECTS - SHOULD BE RECALLED
Our company bought 8 HD 202 headsets in Sept 2008. After 3 months of use four of the headsets quit working at a rate of one per week. The company is good at honoring replacements but one must pay for the shipment there. If you buy these through Amazon the company will NOT refund the purchase price no matter what. They will just continue sending replacements. For us that means A LOT of down time as we have to wait for the replaced headsets to be shipped back. The problem with all of the headsets is that one side abruptly quits working. It appears to be a defect in the product and probably should be recalled (in my opinion). <br /><br />So...purchase at your own risk. You might not be using them after the one year warranty is up.

Will not last
The headphones sound OK, but mine (and others) fail at the plug--and you get low volume or one-channel or cutting out. Because of the way they are constructed, they cannot be easily repaired. The Sennheiser web site does not sell replacement plugs or cables for these units and in fact offers no guidance or comment on this probem at all---even though it is a common mode of failure. Once this failure happens, your investment is essentially lost.

Doesn't hold up to wear
Sure, the price is great and the sound is good, while they last! I've gone through two of these. One lasted 18 months, the next 6 months. In each case, the right side failed, I assume because of a bad connection. I don't mistreat them, they just don't wear well. I guess you get what you pay for.

Avoid at all Costs -OR- No Tall, Active, Music Enthusiasts Need Apply
I would not call myself an audiophile by any stretch but as life-long musician with a music library of 15,000 eclectic tracks I feel as though I know a thing a two about music.  I bought these for myself as a replacement for a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6G9RI">Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)</a> that unfortunately were damaged in a European backpacking trip a few months ago.  <br /><br />After reading the mostly favorable reviews and noticing the modest price of $30 I went ahead and purchased a pair of J3s earbuds and looked for a much needed improvement from my iPod earbuds that had been holding down the fort.  After about a week of use and nearly 40+ hours of "burn-in" using manufacturers own recommended mp3 files found on their website I am sorry to say that I am writing this review while listening to my tunes using my 6 month old iPhone earphones as my J3s sit uselessly in their very attractive case.<br /><br />Two huge criticisms of these earbuds.  Poor sound quality and the poor design.  First of all, the length of the cord reveals the height-ist nature of the R&D folks who designed it.  If you are active and much over 6' feet read no further and try another pair of earbuds.  You'll be sorry otherwise.  I stand at 6'4'', by no means a giant, and as I keep my iPod in the pocket of my shorts at the gym the cord the cord is barely long enough for the buds to reach my ears as I run on the treadmill or lift weights while standing.  There is no chance that I would ever use these if I was running through the city, jumping rope, or doing anything in the least bit active for fear they I'd spend half of my workout worrying about keeping the buds in my ears.  Also, due to material from which the cord is made, the bouncing of the cord against my chest interferes with the sound quality as the it provides it's own soundtrack over my music that can be likened to an off-beat high school marching band bass drum player or the irregular heartbeat of a large mammal.  I've had noise-reducing earbuds before but noise-INducing?...these are a first.<br /><br />Both of these issues might be tolerable if the sound quality of the actual buds were as good as billed.  However, this is far from the case.  After attempting to warm-up the buds by running them through a regiment of "burning them in" for a few dozen hours over a long weekend they do not sound much better than the first day they arrived.  For those of you who say that earphones should be "burned-in" for 100-200 hours to reach their maximum potential, remember, these are $30 earbuds we're talking about.  They shouldn't have to receive as much attention and care as a cocker spaniel puppy to be fully appreciated.  If you had to walk 100-200 miles for Nike shoes to feel comfortable they'd have been out of business before the first Air Jordans hit stores.<br /><br />In regards to the actual sound quality, and I apologize for my lack of knowledge of the industry terminology ahead of time, they are incredibly tinny as if the treble setting is through the roof.  I have messed with my iPod settings and the "best" (see: most tolerable) EQ setting I was able to find was either "deep" or "treble reducer."  The mid-range noise is muddled as if the singers and musicians were playing inside of a potato sack, and the bass (the lesser of the three evils) feels like someone keeps lightly bumping a q-tip against my eardrum.  You can even hear crackling at times.  Maybe they're starting to burst into flames from all of the "burning in"?<br /><br />All in all, I would not recommend these earbuds to anyone, even at half the price!  I would return them if I could but instead it seems that my iPhone earbuds will have a very cool case for the time being.

Poor performance
Unfortunately, I am returning these earphones.  I read the poor reviews about the sound quality, but I am not an audiophile and thought I probably would not even notice the problem others have compained about.  After receiving this pair, I did as the manufacturer recommended and burned them in for at least 36 hours.  Then I plugged them into my iPod and listened to a favorite Enya song.  It sounded poor.  I unplugged the JBuds and plugged in the (much-maligned) Apple earbuds that came with the iPod.  Wow!  What a difference!  The sound was deeper and fuller and not tinny. It really made me appreciate the Apple earphones!<br /><br />It is disappointing that these earphones are so poor.    <br /><br />

Tinny and noisy
I bought these to replace the uncomfortable earbuds that came with my IPod.  The best thing I can say about them is that they are comfortable in the ear.  Otherwise, they are very tinny (too much treble) and worst of all, the cord makes noise when moved or touched.  When I am listening to my IPod wearing these headphones, whenever I touch or move the cord, the sound is amplified through the earplugs and I hear the movement of the cord.  It is a similar sound to what you might hear if a news reporter who is wearing a clip-in microphone accidentally touches the microphone or something rubs against it. Very weird.  I thought maybe I was imagining it, but asked my husband to try them out and he experienced the same thing.  I am sending them back for a refund.

Good for two weeks
I read the other reviewers comments on these earbuds about the tips coming off, but thought I'd take that as fair warning to be careful and bought them anyway.  Well, after only two weeks I came home from the gym with my ipod and my "new" earbuds, and noticed the plastic tip was gone when I sat them down.  I don't think my ear swallowed it, but never saw it go.  These little guys work just fine if there was a way to replace the buds.  I should've glued them on.

Comparing Five Low-Cost Earbuds
As a regular I-Pod user, I've never been that unhappy with the standard Apple I-Pod earbuds -- they don't sit terribly well in the ear, but I find the sound and design to be adequate.  I've wondered if there is a low-cost alternative, and my wife doesn't like them because they are too big and uncomfortable. <br /><br />Here is a review of five low-priced alternatives bought on Amazon in March 2010. The story in a nutshell -- all the $8-$10 earbuds are a slight step up from the Apple buds, all the $6 earbuds are a big step down.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IG66VS">JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)</a> (paid ten dollars) (Four stars)<br />Positives: Good sound, decent comfort, long cord<br />Negatives: Too long cord, no "slider"<br />A very solid sound -- much like the Apple buds.  These are a great low-cost in-ear alternative to the Apple buds.  The sound balance is similar to the Apple's, but a bit crisper and clearer, perhaps due more to the in-ear design than the actual technology. The JBuds ship with three sizes of silicone ear-inserts for different size ears, though I personally find the fit to be awkward and a bit slippery (see SkullCandy review below).  A 54" cord was the longest of the ones I tested, and arguably too long.  Also, there is no "slider" on the cord to hold the buds together when you are storing them (A very nice feature of the standard Apple buds and others).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014JI7OM">Skullcandy INK'D Earbuds (White)</a> (paid ten dollars) (Four stars) <br />Positives: Great bass, very comfortable, long cord<br />Negatives: Too much bass, line-rustle noise in cord<br />How it is possible to get so much bass into a tiny and cheap earbud I cannot imagine, but there it is.  Really impressive, but it's actually a bit too much bass -- the balance is off.  If you are listening to bass heavy music, it's overwhelming -- I had to try to adjust the EQ on the I-Pod to bring it down, and even then a bit too heavy.  The sound is not mushy or distorted, just like the equalizer is shifted too much.  These in-ears come with three sizes of silicone ear-inserts for different size ears, and I find the fit to be great.  A long 52" cord, with a "slider" to hold the buds together when storing.  A BIG concern -- there's a fair amount of cord-noise that rides in the line -- if the cord is brushing against your shirt or jacket when moving, you hear the rustling right in your ear.  I've had worse cases of this in the past, but it is very noticeable in these, and makes them less ideal for walking or moving situations. (Is this a problem with all in-ear buds that have a snug fit?)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IS53">Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Bud Headphones with Acoustic Twin Turbo Circuit</a> (paid eight dollars) (Three stars)<br />Positives: Good sound<br />Negatives: Even bigger than Apple buds, poor packaging, short cord<br />To my ear, the Sony's had the best sound of the five low-cost buds I tried -- a solid step up from the Apple buds, for people who don't like the in-ear style of bud. But a note of caution -- these are slightly *bigger* than Apple earbuds, even without the foam covering.  In my ear, the foam cover makes them comfortable enough, but they are rather large. At the same time, the Sony Fontopia has an unusually short 40" cord (even shorter than the Apple 45" that bothers some people), but it's plenty long for typical uses (walking, etc.).  There is no "slider" to hold the earbuds together when storing, which is a feature I like on the Apple buds. I have one big beef with these though -- the earbuds have a thin foam cover over the speaker that helps it hold in your ear more firmly and comfortably.  I have no problem with that, but you have to put the foam pads on yourself, and it's very difficult.  I ended up tearing one of them before I could even try them out.  It's very frustrating to buy a new product that breaks before you can even use it. These deserve four start on performance, but gotta ding them on the design and packaging.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGI61S">Panasonic RP-HV21Portable EarDrops Earbud Headphones (Black)</a> (paid six-dollars) (one star)<br />Positives: None<br />Negatives: Huge earbud, terrible sound<br />I liked the look of these when I got them out of the package, but they are a bigger and worse alternative to the standard Apple earbuds.  A very "tinny" and shallow sound compared with others at the same price point.  They're too big for comfort in my ear, though that's always a personal consideration -- these Panasonics are larger than the Apple buds and equally hard surface.These Panasonics are about the same size as the Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia earbuds, but those have a foam pad that helps hold them in and provide a little comfort. the "Clip" feature on these (the two buds can clip together, or clip to clothing or cords when not in use) is nice, but doesn't override all the performance downsides.  I'm tossing them -- way worse than the basic Apple buds.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOYMKU">Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones</a> (paid six dollars) (one-star)<br />Positives: None<br />Negatives: terrible sound<br />These are cheap and I like the packaging (just in a plastic ziplock, not clamshells and fluff), but the performance is simply substandard for the pricerange,  These Coby's have a very muffled sound, and don't come with different size silicone ear inserts (most people know these really aren't one-size-fits-all). I'm tossing them -- way worse than the basic Apple buds.

Never worked!
I paid [...] bucks for these so how can I complain, right?  One ear bud did not work from day one.<br />The sound kept fading in and out (mostly out). So it is to you prospective buyer that I will complain,<br />but only in a friendly effort to warn you.  I learned once again - you get what you pay for!

Beware of Cancer Warning
We purchased these really comfortable earbuds and were very satisfied on day 1.  The problem is, in very very small print on the box Coby warns customers that handling the cord brings you in contact with Lead which can cause cancer.  They warn you to wash your hands after use.  This was a gift for someone who already suffers from this terrible disease, wouldn't it be nice if these were not allowed to be sold in this country?  We returned them.  Shame on Coby.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOYMKU">Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones</a>

Good sound quality, horrible design flaws
While these are comfortable and produce decent sound, they are made of cheap plastics and are not worth the money unless you like hearing squeaking, creaking and cracking noises of the plastic parts every time you move your head. The noise coming from the random parts of these headphones renders them useless. <br /><br />Sony products are usually reliable, but whoever designed these should have been more careful when picking materials. I understand that they needed to lower production cost to make them affordable, but this design flaw is simply unacceptable when it comes to headphones... there are cheap plastics that do not make noise. I mean, you wouldn't buy a TV that randomly flashes lights at you, would you?

Great phones...when they worked.
I bought these studio phones and enjoyed them for a little over a year. They looked great, felt great, and sounded incredible.<br />I'm real easy on my equipment, and these phones still look brand new.<br />That said, imagine my surprise when the Right phone quit working.<br />After a little research I found I was not alone on this.<br />I contacted the service department at Audio Technica, and they said they would fix it...for a price(It came out to $30 more dollars than I originally paid for it!).<br />I understand my warranty was up, but a company not willing to back up their crappy product, and still trying to get more money out of my pocket did not sit well with me.<br />I see this more and more. Extreme prices for sub par products.<br />So I'm in the market for some new headphones, and one thing is for sure. This company will not see any more of my money.

Another naysayer
Sales people in large appliance stores invariably represent Bose equipment as the best, "if you can afford it."  And among computer speaker systems, they say Companion 5 is the one.  Well, at $399, most of us need more than brand recognition and manufacturer hype--the sales person's stock and trade.    We want to know what C5 owners think.  Was the money worth it?  <br /><br />There are plenty of rave reviews on Amazon.  Five star ratings and comments on how much people love their Companion 5's, how superior these are to the competition, and how good music sounds through them.  There are some nay sayers, of course, there always are.  But these are said to be the usual Bose bashers, people who hesitate because of costs, high-end snobs (Bose is not really high-end), or people who can't or simply refuse to appreciate  a qualitative difference.<br /><br />I confess.  I bit on this slim evidence, bought the Companion 5 system, brought it home and began listening.  <br />I was immediately disappointed.  But then I expected to be after decades of hearing music through a high end stereo system.  It would be ridiculous to expect a $399 system to match well in that way.  Still, shouldn't the C5 perform better than this?  <br /><br />I went back and took a closer look at those negative reviews at Amazon.  "Thin, tinny.  Like listening through a phone line."  That was exactly how it sounded to me.  "The highs are extremely sharp, and hurt my ears."   "Strident, blaring." Yes, and because of this I can't take it for more than a few minutes at a time.  "The bass was too powerful" "muddy."  To me, the bass is a thump, thump, thump, and does overwhelm the vocals on some songs.  <br /><br />Now these are puzzling experiences since many reviewers were astonished by the musicality of their own speakers.  Different ears, different expectations, different computers, different music, different music source...?  <br /><br />Back to the store for another speaker system for a comparison.  Now I was able to switch back and forth between a Logitech Z2300 a 2:1 system.  For me at least, the Logitech, which sold at one third the price,  was far superior for listening to my I-tunes music.  It is hard to put musical experiences into words but it seemed to me that the music was warmer, more integrated--not so mechanical and partitioned.  I could hear  distinctive voice qualities from the vocalists.  If I were unfamiliar with the music, I couldn't have reliably identified singers through the Bose speakers.  And there was separation in the bass.  I could hear some detail, not just a murky thump, thump, etc.<br /><br />I called my wife in for a blind test.  She could care less about such things but agreed reluctantly while making it clear that she is against buying ANY new speaker equipment.  LIke me, she heard the differences immediately as I sneakily switched back and forth between the two systems.  She was put-off completely by the Bose system.  This was true for a wide range of music including folk, classical, rock, big band.  It was always the same.<br /><br />So, the question is, how can the Bose system sound so bad for some of us, and so good for others?   Does it really matter?  Those happy with their C5s will continue to be happy.  Others, like me, will return them to the store.  Those about to make a purchase can only listen and draw their own conclusions.    <br /><br /><br /><br />     <br /><br />                        <br /><br />

Very Disappointed
I  just opened my new Soundsticks II system and am so very disappointed. They sound great with deep bass-intense music, like old R&B, but sound terrible for any music with significant sound in the higher end of frequency spectrum (nearly every pop & rock song). Music with a lot of sound in midrange and higher frequencies sounds very tinny - really just terrible. I will probably return them. Such a bummer, because they do look VERY cool.<br /><br />The instructions make it clear that the sound from these speakers is highly directional, so I've tried adjusting the position several times. This is not a positional issue. This is not an equalizer issue. The satellite speakers simply have a very harsh sound in the high frequency range. Almost like they are distorting. I cannot recommend these speakers to anyone.

Poor quality, poor support
This is a bike of very poor quality. To begin with, the bike was received with a pierced tire tube and incorrect seatpost size (the seatpost included was too wide to fit in the hole - this was confirmed by a bike shop). When I contacted Kent Bicycles for support, I received yet another incorrectly-sized seatpost, despite my specific instructions. Eventually, the bike shop had to order the seatpost at a cost of $20. Very quickly, the front gears broke and somehow bent, making the lowest gear unavailable for use. Eventually, once other components started breaking, I contact amazon.com for a replacement, and lo and behold, the incorrect size seatpost was included. Does Kent Bicycles send out this same incorrect seatpost for all Denali bikes?<br /><br />Bottom Line: Stay far far away from this product, and if you absolutely have to have it, buy it in-store, pre-assembled at Walmart.

It's in the trash now
Having just removed my unit and thrown it in the trash, I would like to say that I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who wrote the "most helpful" earlier review. <br /><br />1. The fact that it is a "name brand" is meaningless. Some other company arranged for a license to use the famous Schwinn name. That says nothing about product quality.<br /><br />2. Many of the functions are completely pointless padding, useful only as a marketing gimmick. Such things as calorie count and fat burning make no sense without details about terrain and other conditions. I once coasted down Mt. Haleakala in Maui. Hours of biking; zero calories! There are very sophisticated (and expensive) bike computers that measure pedal rotation and elevation. This is not one of them, and should not pretend to be.<br /><br />3. The installation instructions are not only hard to understand; they are dead wrong. They refer to mounting clamps that don't exist; the unit now relies on plastic cable ties instead.<br /><br />4. Mostly what I want - and I suspect almost everyone wants - from a bike computer is easy display of speed and distance. This unit cannot be set to always show those two vital statistics full-time by default.<br /><br />5. Controlling functions requires arbitrary pushing and holding of one or the other buttons, in combinations that make no logical sense. Changing functions while riding may be dangerous to the rider.<br /><br />6. Despite the earlier reviewer's belief that we should "feel foolish" for not reading the instructions to his satisfaction, the ones who should feel foolish are those who designed the human interface for this monstrosity. A simple device shouldn't require careful study of a user manual, especially one written in 6-point type.<br /><br />I really tried to give this unit every chance, and as a result went beyond Amazon's 30-day return window. So, a ten-buck lesson that I hope others will benefit from. I just bought and installed the Planet Bike Protégé 9.0 9-Function Bike Computer, also on Amazon, and it is terrific. Three times the price, but well worth it in my opinion.

Very Flimsy
Just for reference: I ride my bike everyday.  *Maybe* for an occasional bike rider, this should suit fine.<br /><br />When I received this cage, I was surprised on how flimsy it is: it flexes too much!  I thought it was by design...until one day I crashed my bike sideways...BAM!  the top part snapped off!<br /><br />For somebody who will ride their bike everyday (especially on trails) and need a dependable bottle cage, look somewhere else.<br /><br />I love Topeak products, but I'm afraid this one's a miss.

colored klean kanteen
Save your money on the Klean Kanteens with color.  Buy the stainless steel ones.  The product itself is quite fine, but the colored ones arrive scratched and marred, so I think it will just be a matter of time before they do that anyway.  Amazon did replace the marred ones, but I wish I had purchased the stainless steel ones.

Good Luck Trying to Get This on Your Water Bottle!!!
I have a Klean Kanteen water bottle and could not get this sling on the bottle.  The fabric holder has absolutely no give or flexibility, and no amount of effort was enough to get the water bottle into the sling.  Maybe the sling they sent me was defective (it came unlabeled in a zip-top, sandwich-size bag).  Returned for a refund.  Love the idea of a sling, but... Don't waste your time or money until manufacturer improves this sling.

Not "WORTHEY" at all, in my experience
A few weeks ago , I was going to order five of these slings, from Worthey Read. The price was (is) right. BUT, you were charging me 4.99 for EACH strap (that weighs like 2oz. ea.)That would be 24.95, just for S&H. THAT... IS A RIPOFF !!! AND, VERY POOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS !!!  So I ordered one (1). It took NINE (9) business days. It came in a 9 x 12 size envelope, the postage was 1.56.. I'm sure the wherehouse person was not going to ship each one seperate (bad time management & waste of envelopes). You could have shipped all five (5), aprox. 10 oz. in the same envelope (they take no space at all) for still under 4.99. You would of had me as a customer in the future.  I wanted to order another 5, extra for myself & friends. I'm looking at other avenues to get them from. 5 STARS for the product.. 1/2 STAR for customer relations. If I was able to find a number to call, I would havve asked NICELY, if something could have been worked out on S&H.... But in my review I'm expressing my annoyance.

Please Stay Away!
As you can tell if you read these reviews, the Roomba works great until the day it doesn't. On that day you are completely out of luck with any servicing. Ours quit operating properly shortly after the one year warranty expired. I would expect to pay for shipping and even pay to have my unit serviced. But all Roomba would do is offer to sell me another one. Why would I buy another unit of something that already broke once and that no one on God's green earth can service? It is a complex machine. So about a hundred different things can go wrong. If you are beyond waranty period forget IRobot company helping you. Their phone support is pitiful, and their service department does not exist. Any company that wilfully turns happy customers into unhappy customers everyday will soon be out of business.

Warning: Unreliable, bad product support
Unreliable, bad product support<br /><br /><br />If I could go back in time, I would not have bought the Roomba. I used the I-robot to do light maintenance vacuuming during the week in my house. We have no pets or kids, and we take our shoes off at the door when we come into the house from outside. I read the manual, and treated the I-robot with considerable care. I cleaned and emptied the vacuum after each use, I made sure it would not get tangled or caught on cords, I checked the Brush to make sure that hair (etc..) was not wrapped around it, and so on. A month after the Warrantee period, the Roomba stopped working. I would turn it on, it would go a few feet, appear to catch on something, and stop. Then it would give the "uh oh" beep. I called customer support, they had me bounce and spin the wheels, blow compressed air into the wheels and wheel wells, and do several other useless exercises before telling me I should buy a new I-robot as none of the parts on the Roomba can be replaced, and no service is offered (even if you are willing to pay for service, they do not service these machines...period). <br />Paying 200-300+ dollars for a vacuum that works for only 13 months is a bad deal. It is also suprising that there are no replacement parts and no service available for the Roomba. If anything goes wrong, replacement is the only option (so they told me).. Here is a list of reasons why I would not recommend this product - some are facts, some are opinions:<br /><br />1. Roomba is a light duty vacuum and does not clean well enough to replace your regular vacuum<br />2. Roomba cannot really be left unattended -it needs tobe supervised<br />3. The company is not going to do you any favors if the product goes wrong - they are "by the book" - my warrantee was 1 month past expiration and I-robot offered NOTHING. I was very polite, and spoke to several people. Both my wife and I called - both with the same result. When we were first speaking with them, and could not remember exactly when we purchased our Roomba, The representative from I-robot pushed for a date. When we told them about a year, they were quick to suggest dates that would have placed us outside the warrantee period. we eventually found the receipt.<br />4. No service is available - if something goes wrong, you have to replace the whole system (except brushes and filters - those can be replaced).<br />5. Questionable reliability - dust and hair can work into moving parts through very small spaces. For a self propelled vacuum that is designed to turn off when it hits an obstacle or gets stuck, this is not so good...<br />6. no way to clean the wheels or other internal parts. In fact, if you take the Roomba apart you void the warrantee... <br />7. Many of the positive reviews you read on this product are probably from people who purchased recently - when I first bought it, I liked a lot it as well - I told everyone about it. That is because it is a cool idea. However, I am not so happy with my purchase now... I feel like I was ripped-off.<br />

Brushes fall off
Just a brief review, because these problems are well known.  For the first two months, this thing was the love of our lives.  Truly marvelous.  (And I would have written a five-star review.)<br /><br />Then the side brushes started snapping off.  And then the replacement brush wouldn't stay attached to the brush module.  And now for the past four weeks, I've been waiting to receive a new brush module, which is on backorder, and iRobot has no idea when it will be available ("we do not have an estimated date").  (But when they do get some, they promise to send me one -- hopefully I'm not too far down their list.)  This sounds like they made a serious design mistake that they failed to catch before starting manufacturing of this line of vacuums.

Very poor customer service & warranty support
I had the same problem that everyone else did, the spider brush that sticks out on the side broke immediately. It is "covered" under warranty - and although the guy I spoke to said he would send me replacements, 2 weeks ago, I've received nothing. After 2 weeks I called again and after traveling around in their phone system for an hour, someone else came on and said there was no order for the replacements for me in the system at all. Further the brushes are backordered at least 6 more weeks. Even worse, she said she could not place an order to get me "in line" without the serial number (which is not with me at work) - even though I am registered in their system.  So now I get to go home, locate the serial number that I already registered, call again and spend another 1 hr trying to get through the phone system to a person who may or may not actually place an order for me......and for a technical company their web site is unbelievably poorly done and it is impossible to submit a question successfully on it to customer service.

Needs improvement in multiple areas
I purchased my Roomba 560 on January 9th and returned it 11 days later. Too bad. I really liked it when it worked. Right out of the box, the light on top of the virtual wall lighthouse that indicates it is working, did not work. Initially, I tried calling customer service, but after going through endless menus, I could not determine how to speak to a live person and there did not seem to be a menu option for my problem. Then, I e-mailed customer service. I explained my situation and asked if I needed to exchange everything or if I could just exchange the virtual wall lighthouse and let them know that I had already checked to see that my batteries were good and installed correctly. It took them 6 days to respond and when they did they said to try new batteries. Shortly after, the side brush stopped working and shortly after that, the roomba would only make tight circles in one place, so I returned it. Apparently, the side brush and the tight circles are common, known problems. I wish the product worked well. I really liked it when it worked, but as of now it is too unreliable, time consuming and expensive to have and the customer service really needs to improve. I would be happy to purchase it again in the future if product and customer service improvements are made.

Terrible parts and service
I recently bought a new 500 series Roomba vacuum cleaner and the front brush literally broke into parts within two weeks of owning it - makes me worried about craftsmanship.<br /><br />I ordered replacement parts and over three weeks later, they have still not shipped!  When I contact customer service, they ignore my emails and do not respond.  This has been some of the worst customer service I have ever encountered.  I am stuck with a useless vacuum because they don't keep basic replacement parts in stock and they are not avaiaable from any of the larger chain stores that carry other vacuums.  <br /><br />Overall, a bad experience.  I do not recommend.<br />

Great idea, but JUNK
Got a roomba 560 for Christmas and have used it for three days so far in the last month, due to a variety of things breaking and the long time it takes irobot to ship replacement parts.<br /><br />First the roller brush started clicking, which was fixed by a new brush. <br /><br />Then the entire brush housing unit failed and had to be replaced.<br /><br />Today the side brush fell off and won't stay on due to the cheap plastic sleave that is suppose to hold a spinning brush via a small screw.  What genius design that???????<br /><br />I really looked forward to the roomba and think it is a great idea, but the engineering is terrible and there is no way a product like this will hold up over time.

Lots of Fun, But Very Limited Utility
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUBCNO">iRobot 560 Roomba Vacuuming Robot, Black and Silver</a>  This is fascinating technology, sleek design, and lots of fun to watch (for a while).  However, as a vacuum, even for minor clean up, it was a complete failure and disappointment.  We started with a freshly vacuumed room with both rugs and hardwood flooring.  Within minutes it stopped itself and a red light blinked because dog hair had jammed its brushes.  After cleaning out the brushes, we tried again, and hair wrapped around not only the brushes but the bearings and elsewhere.  Every time it encountered hair it stopped and told me to clean the brushes and/or the filters.  It might be a great help for a home with no dogs or cats, but clearly it could not handle hair, even the residue left in an already- vacuumed rug.

Can no longer recommend
I used to be a strong proponent of Roomba products, and I still have the original model that works well.  However, the newer products have very unpredictable battery life.  It's not clear whether you should leave the batteries on the charger or unplug them.  This confusion caused one of my batteries to no longer hold a charge after only 10 uses.  Customer service, which used to be very user-friendly, refused to replace it for free.  It's a shame.  I always used to recommend Roomba products to all my family and friends, but I can no longer do so with a clear conscience.

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRID
Here's the good news, bad news on this seemingly ingenuous product.  WHEN it works, it's great.  Almost impossible to believe how well it works.  BUT, I've had to replace my robot TWICE in the last two months due to one thing or another.  Not only do you have to spend incredible amounts of time trouble shooting, buying and replacing parts before the company will replace your item, but you must do so at your own inconvenience and expense.  It's a terribly frustrating process.  The Customer Service people are rigid, difficult to understand in some cases because of language barriers.  The company will not replace your robot until they've received yours back, and then it takes WEEKS to see your replacement arrive.  <br /><br />Overall, I'd like my money back.  It's not worth the aggravation, especially when I calculate the number of hours I've spent trying to get my problems resolved.  I'd rather push my upright vacuum.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

Worst tech support ever
I bought the 560 directly from iRobot as a birthday gift for my wife. I received the unit on 8/28/08 and have yet to see it clean anything! Upon initial charging, it gave a "Charging error 5." The owner's manual gives no explanation of what are apparently up to 20 different numbered error codes. The only explanation is "call tech support." <br /><br />So I call tech support, after waiting on hold for about 30 minutes, of course I received someone with barely comprehensible english. After waiting for her to get her own model in front of her and disassemble it, she decided my unit was defective. I was then informed, via email, that I would have to send my unit to iRobot (at my expense) and they would, in turn, send me a replacement. It is now 9/15/08 and I have yet to receive the replacement. <br /><br />This may be the greatest floor cleaning product ever, but I honestly wouldn't know. Their tech support is truly awful and I'm still in disbelief that I have to pay to ship back a product that was defective out of the box. I'm also somewhat amazed that I have to wait until they receive my unit before I receive a replacement. Every other company I've dealt with has sent a return label with their replacement. P*ss poor customer service and, thus far, a worthless product. I did call today and according to their automated system, they have a 10 day delay time upon receipt before they ship another unit. Need I say more?<br /><br />Update:  Received the replacement unit after approximately 1 month. Guess what? It is defective also.  Returning it today for yet another unit. Hint: call during normal business hours and you will get tech support in the U.S. They are much more knowledgeable and helpful.  Still, I would highly recommend staying away from this product. It's junk.

Like many love affairs
Your time with your roomba will start with enthralled fascination. You will gush to your friends- I don't know how I ever lived with out this, I set it and forget it, it is awesome. But then you have to clean it. OK not bad you think to yourself not much worse than my regular vacuum. But soon the dirt on you increases as you have to clean the brushes, then get a can of air and blow out the sensors. You start to think I am spending more time cleaning my roomba than I do on vacuuming. A call to tech support gets you the one great suggestion of "pick it up 3-5 inches off the ground and drop it" (I kid you not that was the only real tech support I got when it started going in circles.) And as the unit's behavior gets more and more sporadic (we won't even mention the batteries that need replaced every 6 months)you start to feel cheated, what happened to the robot I first had?. Finally this love affairs ends as so many others do in a pile of dust and you flinging your roomba across the room. My suggestion is to leave the roomba alone. Maybe in time it will find a way to do the job that it was built for longer than 6 months. Until then save your money.

It broke TWICE within 11 months of use
Worked okay until it broke.  We own ONE dog.  We cleaned it after every run.  We ran it in one room every 3 days (where we and the dog played the most).  It ran in the whole house every 10 days or so.  Not high usage, just average.  The dog hair would get INSIDE the motor housing unit.  I kept getting "please remove and clean roomba's brushes".  It wouldn't run.  It had been 5 months of usage.  I called, got a new motor no problem.  They told me I could take apart the old one since I had a new one on the way.  I did, found all this dog hair inside the gears and inside the motor.  Got out what I could and it ran for another month.  Same thing happened, "please remove and clean...."  Replaced it with the new motor.  Same thing happened, "please remove and clean...."  My husband bought it in November for a Christmas present, so now it is November, warranty is expired.  Paid $500 for it and more for all kinds of parts for it (brushes, filters, etc.).  Now it is useless.  I certainly don't want to buy another, spend $500 for a one year life.  It was great while it worked but to not be able to handle ONE dog?

would be 5 star if it worked for more than a month at a time
This thing is way cool- when it works- which is probably 6 months of the last 13.<br /><br />Like many others here I have had repeated problems with the side brush falling off- I have replaced the module once and have just ordered another one.  <br /><br />I have also replaced the power supply, the virtual wall, the main brush module- which is not working again as I write, the bushingless gear bearing holes having worn themselves too big for their gears to contact each other.  I have just ordered another.<br /><br />Each of these problems has resulted in a 4-12 week wait for new parts.  Routine wear parts such as filters and brushes come with the same delay.<br /><br />My 15 year old Eureka works perfectly.  It has needed a new part every 3-4 years and each time I have found the part I needed in stock at the local vauum store for less than $15.<br /><br />I purchased my Roomba when I constructed a new home instead of installing a central vacuum system.  BIG mistake.  If it worked as well as it did the first week I would have rated this 5 stars.  As it is  would rather have the central vacuum.

Ruined my floor and then had terrible customer support
I had a Roomba 560 for about 5 months  At first I loved it, but then I came home one day to find it dead in the middle of my floor - and on top of a deep circular groove it had carved in my brand new hardwood.  Obviously, I was upset.<br /><br />When I first called iRobot tech support, they said they'd refund it and pay to repair the floor.  That made sense, and although I would have preferred to just not ruin the floor, it seemed fair.<br /><br />Well, two months later - I've paid $450 to repair the groove, submitted all sorts of paperwork (photos, receipts, etc), and emailed and called tech support over a dozen times, and - still no refund or repair payment.  They did offer to send me a new robot.  But of course, I can't risk that it will do the same thing again.  <br /><br />It was great at first, but since then, it not only caused major damage, I've been exposed to iRobot tech support which has to be about the worst customer experience I've had at any company ever.<br />

No support for broken Roombas
I bought one in November,and two weeks later it crapped out! Roomba refused to replace it, and told me repair parts were on back order !!!! For these prices things should work or the company should replace them. I wrote to the head of the company and still no results!!! Stay away from these people who don't care about customers !! Roomba is great idea but when there are problems they don't stand behind the product !!!!

Run from this yellow dawg!
I was so overwhelmed by all the glowing reviews that I purchased the Dirt Dog post haste. When Dirt Dog #1 arrived I charged it up according to directions, pushed the big button on top and stared in amazement as it gave a slight shutter, emitted an electronic death rale, and succumbed before my very eyes. I tried to revive the mutt but no amount of tinkering would raise this puppy from the dead. I called HSN and they were more than willing for me to return it for a full refund. Rationalizing that I must have received that one in a million dud, I requested a replacement. I was overjoyed to get the brand new replacement as I still had faith in all those sunshine pumpers in Amazonland. I charged up DD#2 and set it to work in my large tiled sunroom but it refused to pick up birdseed that had fallen from my birdcage. It did however manage to immobilize itself when a couple of stray dog hairs clogged its front wheel. I removed the dog hair and started it going again. I left the room and returned 15 minutes later to discover to my horror that the beast had attacked a table leg, got hung up and bashed its front sweeper brush to smithereens. I called iRobot and they promply shipped out another brush. I installed the new brush but alas it still wouldn't pick up squat. I finally gave up and shipped it back to HSN for a refund. I am now happy to report that I no longer have a dog in this fight.

Dead Dirt Dog
Purchased dirt dog from Irobot.  Used only one time then it stopped working. Finally talk to Irobot and they tell me, "you pay the shipping to send the broken dirt dog back to us (minus a few parts), and do not use original box (i.e. now buy a new box).  <br /> <br />When I pointed out that by having the customer pay for shipping and handling (approx. $20) to return a defective product that the customer (me) is paying MORE money to own a defective product.  If I choose to send the roomba back for refund - as it's defective - I still have to pay the return postage (but at least I'll save the expense of buying a new box).  <br /><br />Oh, and read their warranty - they reserve the right to replace broken roombas with remanufactured parts/pieces.  So if you bought a new, defective roomba, you may just PAY more money to have Irobot send you used parts.  Sweet.

on second unit and still not working
Purchased this Dirt Dog in June on line at Fryes, never worked, called I-robot, they sent me a new battery, still did not work, they sent me a replacement unit (I paid to ship it to them) second unit does not work, I have been on the phone with them a total of 4 times and have not yet had a chance to use this product. Be sure to keep your original packaging in case you need to return the whole thing to your online place of purchase. Whew, I could have saved so much time sticking to my regular vacuume.

Simply did not work properly
I bought the Dirt Dog to help keep my hardwood floors clean of cat hair, cat litter, and dust. I chose the Dirt Dog over the regular Roombas because it was less expensive and because of all the rave reviews it received on Amazon.com. I was so unhappy with the Dirt Dog's performance that I sent it back the week after I received it.<br /><br />It simply did not do what it was supposed to do. The battery life was relatively short and the charge ran out long before my small living room floor was clean. Despite repeated passes over the area, it picked up only about half of the cat hair, litter, etc. It was not a case of the bin being too full because it didn't work well even when the bin was completely empty. There were other annoyances -- it's really noisy and it crashes into things like wood furniture hard enough to leave a little dent. The main complaint, however, was that at best it picked up half of the dirt and hair. <br /><br />Amazon customer service was very helpful in processing the return. I now have a Roomba 560 and am much happier with it -- the vacuum works great, it's a little quieter, and it has sensors that slow it down a little when it nears a wall or piece of furniture. My advice is to pay a little more and get a real Roomba.

A WARNING ABOUT THEIR WARRANTY REPAIR- BUYER BEWARE
I have nothing but GREAT things to say about the product itself. It does a fantastic job and now my kitchen floor gets cleaned far more often than I'd scrub it on my own. <br /><br />HOWEVER, their Customer Service and Warranty Repair policies leave much to be desired. It's a VERY long and drawn out story. But the short version is this... <br /><br />I received it as a gift for X-mas 07. Early April 08 the battery died. Warranty Repair dept. said they'd ship me a new one. I received an e-mail then saying it was backordered. After lots of phone tag and e-mails back and forth, I finally pointed out that they had them listed on their website as available and ready to ship. <br /><br />I finally got my replacement battery after almost a month. It was refurbished and not the same model as the one I originally had. I had a 100 minute battey, they shipped me a 50 minute battery. I did not find this out because they told me. I found this out by chance. After further research it was confirmed that they sent me a cheaper battery than the one I originally had. When I called, they basically told me too bad. <br /><br />I had to escalate this from a person on their 800 line to a supervisor and finally via a written request to a manager. The manager said that even though they have new 100 minute batteries on their website available, they would not send me one. I was stuck with the 50 minute battery. They made no apologies for sending the wrong one and in fact stated they knew they sent the wrong one. <br /><br />The particular SCOOBA I have was purchased because it came with a 100 minute battery. A less expensive model could have been purchased with a 50 minute battery, but that's not what I wanted. But it's now what I am stuck with. <br /><br />I also asked to have my entire SCOOBA replaced if that was the only way I could get my 100 minute battery replaced. I was told if I were to do that under warranty, they would replace it with a re-furbished SCOOBA and a 50 minute battery. <br /><br />I have since called my local news. They are investigating what happened and hopefully, I will get my 100 minute battery. That's all I want. <br /><br />After telling my Mom about my ordeal, she said she also had to have her battery replaced under warranty. When she looked, sure enough... they sent her a 50 minute battery too. <br /><br />The product is great. But if it breaks down... you will be downgraded to a lesser model.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed that a company with such a great product will not stand behind their name.<br /><br />As for me, I will not be buying the Roomba I so badly wanted and my husband will not be buying the Dirt Dog or the one the cleans gutters.  It's really a shame.<br /><br />Buyer Beware.

Roomba Battery is worthless, It only last about a year or more
The battery is horriable on the Roomba.  I have a hard time believing that they can't fix this problem.  I bought my Roomba at Hammacher.   I wish that everybody that is looking at this message bought their's at Hammacher.   Hammacher has a life time guarantee.  Everytime my battery goes dead, I send my Roomba back to Hammacher and get a new Roomba.  In the past 4 or 5 years, I have send four Roomba back and had them replaced.   I've actually upgraded my Roomba everytime to the last and greatest Roomba that they have.   I currently own the Roomba Scheduler. And despite the problems with the battery,I love my Roomba, but do hate the battery.  It beginning to appear that my battery is dead again, time for another Roomba upgrade.

junk, not worth the money
After the original Roomba battery died just after the 1 year warranty expired I decided I'd go ahead and get my beloved Roomba working again by buying this battery.<br /><br />Less than 3 months later I'm once again in the same boat with a dead Roomba battery. Apparently these things are junk and there is plenty found online to back that up. When the robot worked it worked well however instead of throwing $50 in batteries at it every few months I'd have been better off buying an actual vacuum.

IRobot 400 series battery.
After the original battery could not be recharged I ordered a new one from Amazon. It lasted less then three months and I can not recharge it. I have gone through all of the discharging / recharging steps recommended by IRobot without success. Further inspection indicates the pack was remanufactured and probably has a bad cell. Stick with new from IRobot.

Returned! it wouldn't charge
The re-chargeable iRobot battery would not re-charge- after leaving on the charger more than 24hours! I have returned it.  I would like to know if this was a reconditioned battery or a new one! Very frustrated as I had waited a long time without my iRobot working since the original battery it came with stopped re-charging after a year of use - and I really hated to pay $50 for a new battery. I read that you should not leave the battery in the charger plugged in.  I'm not sure if that is the reason the original battery quit working. Now, I'm really frustrated that I still can't use the iRobot.  I guess I'll order another one and try again when I get my credit from Amazon.

Buyer Beward
Be wary when buying anything from Amazon.com I would suggest, and be sure to read the fine print. Ultimately, this item claims to be sold by Amazon.com. However, if you have a defect, you are instructed by Amazon to direct your returns to the seller/manufacturer. I spent an hour trying to find a way to break through this loophole, even looked for a way to contact Amazon directly; there isn't one. When you phone iRobot (the party listed as the manufacturer of the battery/Roomba) you are informed by their customer service department that they are not responsible for returns, as the item you bought from Amazon was not actually SOLD to Amazon by them. In fact, they let their products be sold to 3rd party sellers, who THEN sell them to Amazon, who then sell them to you. Nice.<br />So, if this item is defective, who takes the responsibility for it? Apparently, you the consumer, since you won't be getting a refund from either the seller OR the manufacturer.

Warning - I got a generic and not the manufacturer product pictured
I purchased on May 2, 2010, and at that time the product was being fulfilled by Alfaoutlet.<br /><br />I received a generic product and not the manufacturer product pictured.  It came with the comment, "Generic product.  Higher capacity (3300 mAH).  Better performance than original Roomba battery.  Satisfaction Guaranteed. [...]  Warranty: 6 months."  It very much looks like the cheapest possible generic - screw heads aren't perfectly level, some of the philips heads are slightly stripped, the plastic feels cheaper/less sturdy, and feels lighter than the original manufacturer battery.<br /><br />If I had wanted the generic one, I would have either bought from the many here that are advertised as such, either from a reputable generic, or paid less for a true cheapie.<br /><br />I have no idea how well the generic will perform, but I bought this one here because I did not want to play generic roulette.<br /><br />Possibly, since it looks like this is now being fulfilled by Amazon, they will give the real battery.  I have no idea.  Beware.<br /><br />

Robot Not Working Properly
I purchased an iRobot 4905 Battery from Amazon.  My robot is not working properly.

Doesn't work (at least not with the scheduler)
I bought this battery to replace my other one because even though I had tried to reset it my Roomba would only run for about five minutes before returning to dock.  I plugged this battery into my Roomba, let it charge for the requisite 16 hours, and then reprogrammed the scheduler.  Unfortunately, when the Roomba came off the dock and began to run, it again only ran for five minutes before running out of power.  So now that this supposedly new battery doesn't work I am at a loss to explain what I have to fix.  I did bypass the dock and plugged the Roomba into the charger directly, but I haven't run it several times having done that to see if the problem is with the charging prongs on the dock or not.  I would definitely recommend that anyone that buys this battery beware.

Doesn't Work w/ Roomba 400
This product does not fully work with the Roomba 400 base model.  It merely acts as a charging station that you manually have to set the Roomba 400 on.  The Roomba 400 does not have the technology or cabability to find and return to the Home Base, nor does it have a button to direct it to do so.  Do not buy this product to go along with a Roomba 400. Use the plug-in charger that comes with it instead.

Vacuum OK -As long as its working -Hoover service dismal
Let me first say that, while it was working, this vacuum met my expectations and performed well.  With extended use it consistently over-heated and ceased to work until it had time to cool down. After about 11 months of average use, the power nozzel stopped working and, since this is not user servicable (can't replace the belt), I took it in for warranty service.  The first time I got it back after a month and the problem was not fixed (it was as if no one even touched it). I immediately took it back (that was 45 days ago) -Hoover still has it and the estimate is about 2 more weeks.

A great first impression, but.....
I bought the Flair because there were so many positive reviews here.  What a mistake!!  It works great the first time - lots of power for its category and the power head is nice, but try opening the dirt compartment to empty it!  The little tab that you slide with your thumb (commmon on many stick vacuums) moves part of the latch, but the other part of the latch (2 little "buttons" inside) does not move so you pretty much have to pry the dirt compartment off, risking breakage.  I contacted Hoover, asking them to send a replacement for the part since it seems to be a design flaw, but they just sent me a part number so I could order the part myself.  <br /><br />Another problem is that the motor does not have a filter so the dirt just sucks up into the motor compartment.  This was semi-ok when most of the debris was pet hair - I took a shop-vac and sucked the debris out of the motor compartment and it somewhat came back to life.  I then fashioned a filter by cutting a circle of air conditioner filter, but it blocks a lot of the sucking power.   I finally gave up and ran it again without the filter and, after a couple of minutes of vacuuming small-grain dust, it just made a funny sound and turned into a barely functioning, whimpering mess.  So, I got three uses out of it and it's trash!!<br /><br />Finally, when  a large clump of hair got caught in the power head, as happens with vacuums, I could just barely reach my skinny finger up there to pull some of the dirt/hair out.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very unhappy that a little vacuum with such great potential turned out to be such a big disappointment.

Excellent product for those who are happy with a 6 month life expectancy
This product is as sneaky as many other Hoover products. Great specifications, neat appearance, fine performance and then complete failure in 6 months. If the product is relatively inexpensive, it isn't practical to get Hoover to honor the warranty because the shipping is always on the customer. I am clearly not a fast learner insofar as vacuums are concerned because this the 3rd Hoover that has failed me.<br /><br />Fortunately for me I purchased from Amazon and was quite fairly treated by their customer service dept.

I've had it for a year...it didn't last...it's in the trash now.
I bought it exactly one year ago and it's been giving me problems for the last 4 months. The suction has gradually gotten weaker since 6 month after purchase. I have a small apartment and vacuum 1 or 2 times a week. <br /><br />I actually loved it the first 6 months. It worked awesome. But for $50 what can you expect? Now it doesn't work at all. I had Amazon overnight me the Dyson DC-15. It's bulkier but works has MUCH stronger suction that the Hoover EVER did.  <br />If you have kids or pets, don't waste your money on this.

EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED
I bought this stick 14 months ago to clean hardwood floors of a new townhouse.  Guess what?  It just stopped working (just out of it's 1-year warranty).  The head brush no longer moves, and in looking at the Hoover manual that it came with, they don't give belt replacement info.  The manual says to "...take it to a Hoover Dealer for service".  What a joke-- I'd spend more on service than I spent on the vacuum.  My advice-- spend the money and buy a more reliable vacuum.  I loved the lightweight system originally, now I'm using the vacuum I've had-- a Panasonic upright for 17 year, and no service ( and I laughed at myself for buying a Panasonic vacuum... hmmm).  It's not the greatest for hardwoods, but at least it works.  What's happened to America that we manufacture things that break in a year?!  I will NEVER buy another Hoover EVER-- Hoover should be ashamed to manufacture such an inferior product.

Stopped working in fewer than 30 days
Like others I am disappointed with this purchase.  It worked great and I loved it for the first three weeks, then out of the blue it stopped working.  I was vacuuming some hardwood floors and the machine suddenly became kind of quiet.  I turned it over and noticed that although the suction was still working, the roller was no longer turning. Without the roller it doesn't pick up much of anything.  This may be caused by a problem with the belt or it may be something more serious.  The owner's manual says that owners cannot change the belt so either way I would have to take it to a Hoover repair center.  I can only imagine that costs more than I paid for it, plus the time and hassle involved makes it not worthwhile to me. I liked this vacuum, but it's not worth $60 for less than one month's use.

What a bummer!
I bought this vacuum on May 17,and it has already quit working.  I loved it, while it worked.  I was completely bummed out.  I had the old Hoover Quick Broom that my husband purchased in 1986.  It worked until April 2007.  I was sure that this new updated version would be even better.  No such luck.  I only used it on hardwood floors to clean up crumbs left behind by my kids, no pet hair, no carpet.  Still, it died after just two months use.  I'm hoping Hoover will live up to the warranty.

Put your money toward a better vacuum
I had the same problem "Broke after only a few months of mild use. Junk. Save your money!" this is the LAST HOOVER I ever buy!<br /><br />

Was great at first, but...
I, too, loved this vacuum.  It worked well on my hardwood floors and area rugs.  But just a few months after purchasing it, the belt broke, and I had to special order a belt since those types of issues are not covered under Hoover's warranty.  Last week it broke again and I replaced at again.  Then, once again, it broke again today.  I am done with this vacuum!

Leaves a wet floor, worked with a homemade pad
This is my first steam mop. I bought this steam mop based on its positive reviews. It took minutes to dry instead of seconds. My neighbor has a Shark Steam mop and that dried in seconds, I decided against that one because it required more physical strength to push. Maybe if they improve the pad, the result would be different. I actually tested my theory and made a pad from a bath floor towel, the mop worked great, my floor dried in seconds. I suggest when they improve the pad, they also improve the pad clip mechanism. The side clips do not hold the pad in place when the mop is being used in the forward and back motion. Instead of returning the mop, I'm going to improve my homemade pad and live with it.

A waste of money
I read all the reviews and had high expectations. It might work great on stone, tiles and wood, but it is worthless on linoleum.  This unit does the same thing as a hot sponge. That's basically all the steamer does. It keeps the rag hot and wet. It doesn't remove ground in dirt or scuff marks from linoleum. I regret my purchase.

The steam mop SHOWDOWN: a first-hand comparison of top steamers and studying of comps
(update: This review was updated on 11-2-09 after I got to compare the Bissell as well as add notes about the Ladybugg steamer at the bottom)<br /><br />I live in a neighborhood where EVERY home is "green built certified" this means that, to have that certification, the builder built no homes with carpet. All the main floors are polished concrete and the upper floors wood. The bathrooms all have tile and/or slate in every home.<br /><br />Because of this, as you could imagine, steam mops are quite the neccessity...not only because they get the hard surfaces better than anything else, but because they are also "green" and clean chemical free. I'll be honest, for us...that's a bonus but we weren't cleaning chemical free before. We like chemical free for our pet's paws but I'll confess I was mopping with chemicals before I got my steamer and just kept the pets out of the room while doing it because, up until then, I couldn't get it clean any other way.<br /><br />Okay, so that said...we decided to have a steamer show down to compare 5 different steamers because my friends and I knew as long as we are in these homes we are gonna have to have a steamer to get all these hard floors clean...we may as well figure out which one to buy next go round. Because my own home is graced with 2 cats, 3 dogs, and two gregarious cooks, my kitchen floor (which had not ever been cleaned by a steamer since my steamer had just arrived) was the testing spot.<br /><br />Mind you, I vaccuum twice per week and do a mega mop twice a week. I THOUGHT I had pretty clean floors in spite of my pet capacity.<br /><br />I thought wrong. These picked up dirt so well it's scary<br /><br />So here's the results:<br /><br />1. steam mops are the mac daddys of clean floors. What these things picked up was tremendous and no comparison to my vigorous prior constant major mopping.<br /><br />2. So now I'll break down the elements of each mop we used and then go into more detail about each at the end. <br /><br />We tried out:<br />"S": The shark by Europro<br />"E" The Envirosteamer by Eureka<br />"H" the haan steamer<br />"M" the Monster<br />"B" The Bissell Green Tea<br /><br />CORD LENGTH: so you don't have to stop and unplug and replug in somewhere else:<br />Shark ( will be referred to as S):20 feet<br />Envirosteamer (will be referred to as E): 25 feet<br />Haan: (will be referred to as H)19'8"<br />Monster (will be referred to as M): 25 feet<br />Bissell (will be referred to as B) 17 feet<br /><br />STEAM TEMPERATURE: this is a primary element. The hotter the steam, the more dirt picked up and hot steam will also kill parasites, mold and mildew and loosen more dirt:<br />S 110 degrees. lame<br />E 220 degrees. very hot<br />H 212 degrees. very hot<br />M 266 degrees. hottest...although the envirosteamer and haan seemed plenty hot enough. The shark didn't clean nearly as well and this was one reason. 110 degrees just isn't going to melt off stuck on grime.<br />B 125 degrees. Note that, because of this low steam temperature the manual said that if I wanted to sanitize the floor or pick up caked on spills, I had to "hold the steamer on the spot for 15 seconds but no more than 20 because that could damage some floors". Now I don't know about you, but if I can sanitize with one swipe of the other steamers because of their sanitizing temps my floor will be done WAY faster...and I also don't have to carry a timer to worry about the extra 5 seconds where my wood floors could get damaged when I have to hold the Bissell for 15 seconds on my wood but no more than 20! My sink water is hotter than the Bissell so it would take less time to use a regular mop if I have to hold the steamer on every spot of my floor for 15 seconds to sanitize. Just sayin<br /><br />BUILD:<br />We found how it was made corresponded with issues with the steamer. The Shark, for example, was quite flimsy and they actually sell replacement handle kits because so many people have issues with the handle breaking! We know this because my neighbor's shark broke and the store had a replacement handle kit on the shelf because he said "it happens often". That's an extra cost.<br />Envirosteamer: Was 5.4 lbs which made it lightweight but strong enough that you didn't have to press down to clean. Very well made and strong parts<br />Haan: not made as well as the envirosteamer but it's more expensive so this was a surprise. A bit flimsy and you need to press down on it more to clean at 3.15 lbs.<br />Monster: hefty and well made at 9 lbs but a bit too heavy unless you want a good workout. (Note: They have changed the Monster handles on the mops now and they are all plastic and people are having breakage issues)<br />Bissell: It's 8.4 pounds but that includes a water filter that you have to get for this one (see notes below)<br /><br />WATER CAPACITY: Very important because having to stop and add more water just adds on to the time you have to spend cleaning, especially if you are cleaning a hallway or livingroom or some other area that has no sink:<br />S: only holds 10 oz of water. Lasted for 10 miinutes of cleaning<br />E: holds 20 oz. of water. Lasted for  over 20 minutes of cleaning (we stopped at 20 and it was still going)<br />H: holds 11.83 oz of water. Lasted for 13 minutes of cleaning<br />M: holds 17 oz. of water. Lasted for 15 minutes of cleaning<br />B: holds 13 oz of water, lasted for 12.5 minutes of cleaning AND you have to undo and remove the tank from the machine every time you fill it up then hook it back on and the steam tank is on the handle rather than the base so the steam doesn't flow directly out after heating up which may explain why it's not as hot once it leaves the machine. The way this mop is made the water flows past heating elements which can, according to Bissell, develop calcium deposits on it so this is the only mop where, because of this, you also have to use a water filter with it and replace the water filter when there is build up which means an extra 12 bucks every few months. The better mops are made to heat the water in a metal tank so this is not an issue and you pour the water directly into the tank.<br /><br />STEAM HOLES: We found a difference although you'd think they'd all be the same. The shark and Bissell only had one hole that the steam came out of so it wasn't cleaning things on the edges, just in one spot. All the others had steam coming from bottom and sides.<br /><br />SIZE: The taller it is the less stooping, the wider the mop head, the more it covers<br />S: 40"Hx12"Wx7"D. Apparently built only for the height of a small child to push unless you want to bend over and push.<br />E: 50"Hx13.25"Wx6.75"D  (the fact that this depth was smaller made it reach under applicances better...it fit better under things)<br />H: 50.5x11.5x7.5<br />M: 48x12.7.5<br />B: 45.25H (this was uncomfortably short as well) x11 x8.4 (even though this didn't fit under cabinets because of the depth it did swivel the best)<br /><br />Conclusion of comparison: First it must be pointed out that, in order to use the shark and the Bissell, you had to keep pumping the water. This was the most annoying feature of anything...the others just steamed on their own and didn't wear out your fingers. Hated this feature of the shark and Bissell. We liked that the Monster and the Shark and Envirosteamer and the Bissell came with 2 cleaning pads rather than one. The Haan only came with one at the time of the review (I double checked since when she bought hers it was also only one and as of today, that hasn't changed) so that ups the price even more because I can't imagine only wanting one to clean. All worked well on sanitizing mattresses and showers. too.<br /><br />But the winner picked by all of us unanimously as the mop we want to have for our next steam mop order?<br />The Eureka Envirosteamer. It picked up the most dirt, was made as well as the Monster but was less expensive, held the most water, emitted the most very hot steam so it sanitized as well and quickly wiped up caked on spills, lasted 3 times as long with one water resevoir fill-up as the others, and had a cord as long as the monster. BUT if you have carpets than I might recommend the Monster because it has a carpet attachment that allows you to steam clean your carpets and it picked up pretty close to the same amount of dirt as the Eureka Envirosteamer, and had close to the same features...a bit heavier though but that may make it last even longer. It is costlier, but to clean 2 surfaces I would think that might make it worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE: The Haan just started including 2 pads with the mop according to the product description page. Not that this changes our opinion since it didn't work as well and the parts were flimsier, but it should be noted that this issue of not having enough cleaning pads has now been resolved and is equal to the other mops.<br /><br />ANOTHER UPDATE: 1. The Shark came out with a new machine that holds more water and has a longer cord BUT it still only heats the water to 110 degrees so it won't sanitize or get rid of trapped grime at this "bathwater" temperature.<br /><br />Another update: I haven't tried it yet but was told about an even better mop than the Eureka Envirosteamer but I can't personally afford it...still, it's worth mentioning in case you can. It's called the Ladybug XL2300 and is a canister steam mop. It heats the water to 298 degrees (woah!) so it's a super sanitizer but it's over a thousand bucks. It also comes with 6 towels. I didn't include it in my review because I haven't ever tried it and I wanted to only include mops I personally tried but it's got great enough stats that, even though it's out of my price range, I thought I'd pass it on as a super sanitizer when I read about it.<br /><br />Also: Don't spend money buying extra pads for the Eureka. I was in a pinch and used a kitchen dish towel...the rectangular kind...just clip on both ends. It worked just as good or better...because they are thinner so the steam penetrates faster and therefore reaches the floor hotter. However, I would recommend still only using the thick pads that come with it for your wood floors just to be safe. But the super hot steam penetrating the dish towel worked excellent on tile and hard floors. Also, you can flip both the towel and the pads that come with it on the Eureka to double the usage...when it gets dirty, just flip it over and use the other side.  I use several old dish towels with this but I like best the kind that just have a bit of texture but no squares sewn on them...but they all work great. So do the pads.

You've got to be kidding me....
I'm going to make the assumption that the positive reviews on this steamer are from folks who have never used a good high-pressure canister steamer, because no way no how does this Bissell contraption come close to doing what a good steamer should do.  I have an EnviroSteamer canister steamer, and I also used to have an EnviroSteamer floor mop steamer.  I wanted a new floor steamer mop (the old one finally broke after many years of service), as admittedly it is more convenient than the big canister, but EnviroSteamer is no longer made.  Enter the Bissell.<br /><br />First off, who is the idiot that designed a trigger finger-style mechanism?  In order for steam cleaning to work well, steam should be released constantly, not an on-and-off type of maneuver.  If there is a trigger mechanism, there should be a way to keep it on constantly without having to manually depress the trigger (i.e. a lock button).  My hand was fatigued after using the Bissell on just two small bathrooms.  Plus, its a little on the heavy side, so keeping the steam button engaged while pushing is not easy on the hand.  <br /><br />That would have been overlookable if the unit would have actually cleaned well.  Like I said, I really think the folks who posted positive reviews never had a good steamer, but this thing is laughable in terms of getting things "clean"; it also isn't efficient.  The steam doesn't seem hot enough, and isn't under much pressure.  I had to hold the unit over very lightly soiled spots on the tile, and even then had to push back and forth to get very light grease spots out (you know those light grease spots that spatter around the stove and such).  My other steamer zaps stuff out like that on the first pass effortlessly and quickly moves right onto the next.  <br /><br />After a few minutes, the pad on the Bissell gets absolutely sopping wet; hence, the floor is sopping wet and takes a long time to dry - not convenient in the least when you want to clean the floor and get on with the day.  Again - a good steamer dries the floor on the reverse pass, there is very, very little, if any, wetness left on the floor when I use the other model, and only towards the end of a long steaming session when the pad is ultra-saturated with moisture. <br /><br />Essentially, this Bissell performs as a wet mop, not a steam mop.  It doesn't have the steaming power (temp. or pressure) that a good steamer should, and the pad gets so saturated it like mopping the floor with water only - my floors are not getting cleaned as they should.  <br /><br />All in all, good concept, poor machine.  I'm boxing mine up and returning it.  I'll stick with the canister - yea, it's bulky, but it truly CLEANS the floor at a high steam temp. on the first pass, it DRIES the floor,  and its easy to push and not fatiguing on the hands.  Save your money on the Bissell - piece of junk as far as I'm concerned.

Disappointed but I should have known better
This is the third floor steamer I have purchased over the years.  I gave to wanting something that looked easier to use so I went with this and it IS easy to use.  But it does not work the way a steamer should.  You have to have holding tank that can heat to boiling in order to get true steam cleaning. You need to see steam come out.  This just seams to heat the pad with hot water which you then wipe over your floor.  It leaves water that has to dry.  My prior steam cleaners would pratically be dry seconds after you stopped.  I could do a section of a floor and then put the furniture back right away.  This one, I had to actually wait for 10 minutes or more before I could replace the furniture.  I do not dare use this again on my sealed wood floor due to how much moisture it leaves behind.  If you want something what works correctly, you need to wait the 10 minutes for it to heat up before you use it a second time.  That is well worth the wait, rather than waiting for it to dry after you have used it.  If I had only had vinyl floors I might be okay with this, especially if I was going from a mop to this.  Having used other steamers that really used steam, this is a joke and a total waste of money.  I should have known better than to go for convenience over getting the job done right.

BISSELL DISAPPOINTMENT
I have 6 dogs.  I have a Bissell carpet cleaning machine which I love so I thought I would try this.  It left the floor wet and it took forever for it to dry.  I had been using microfiber mops which were okay, but I thought a steam cleaner would be better and faster.  Not so.  At least not for me.  I figured my floors were drier when I finished with my microfiber mop so I went back to it and returned the Bissell.

Do not buy!!!
If you buy it, save your packaging--you will probably be returning it!  The concept is great, the product produces immediate steam and is light weight.  I used it on a 10x10 area of my whole house ceramic tile.  While it did a good job cleaning (about equal with a clean mop and water), it totally stripped my grout sealer off. It did not do a good job on the grout--other than stripping the sealer!  I returned it (Thank you Amazon) and returned to cleaning my floor the old fashioned way.

What you can expect will break:
My new Monster Floor Cleaner was delivered just 9 months ago.  It has been used once a week to clean 500 sq ft of textured ceramic tile floor laid on concrete slab since. It did a very good job cleaning.  I used distilled water exclusively and purchased additional pads.  It frequently required repairs during those 35-40 uses and I longer consider it repairable.  Here is what went wrong:<br /><br />The jets in the front of the Cleaner seem like a great idea but cause more trouble than they are worth.  They blow straight out so nothing is loosened.  Instead, loose dirt is blown around out of control.  The jet trigger is in the handle and opens the steam valve via a wire that gets off track and jammed from time to time.  The jets tend to clog when the cleaner bangs into things.  One could simply forget about keeping the jets running, but the control wire is the reason the handle breaks. The two sections of the handle are joined by a plastic connector that passes the trigger wire and isn't as robust as it should be.  Mine broke twice.  I carefully repaired it once and gave up when it broke again six months later.<br /><br />The flaw I consider a show stopper is the floor steam valve.  It turns the steam off when the handle is raised and controls the amount of steam.  Mine was a little temperamental at the start but then worked dependably for several months.  A few months ago it began sticking again, getting worse and worse.  Steam flow is through plastic tubing which softens and kinks.  Between the valve and the tubing it finally became impossible to finish the floor before the steam cut out.  <br /><br />I love cleaning the floor with steam.  The Monster isn't tough enough for my floor though.  It isn't quite hot enough for tile laid on a concrete slab.  The handle is weak.  The valves and tubing are not robust and not dependably over time.  The steam control and the jets seem nice but lend additional weaknesses to the design.

It impressed me for a little while....then went kapoot!
Well it broke after about 1.5 years of use.  I'm not happy at all with the fact that it only shoots steam out of the front jets but doesn't seem to get hot at all under the pad anymore.  I perhaps will make a project out of taking it apart to see what the problem is with it (not that I can fix it) but my husband is a plumber maybe he can figure it out (since I figure it works the same way a water heater would).  A big disappointment.  I guess simple is the best way to go....back to the mop and bucket for me!<br />

Handle is extremely flimsy
I ordered this mop and spent an hour trying to put together the handle.  It is so flimsy, it is difficult to even get it together.  I'm sending it back because there is no way this will last even a year.  Ken's charges for shipping and is making me pay for the return shipping plus insurance.  I won't be ordering from them again.

Steam vs. Scrub
After trying other steam mops hastily purchased for my mom at Target, Sears, etc...I've decided I love MY steam mop - this steam mop.  Whether its called the Euroflex or Monster Steam Mop, it produces a lot of steam and actually sanitizes.  Others like the H2O mop need up to 15 seconds in a spot to actually sanitize.  After trying other steam mops, this one works extremely well and does what's promised.<br /><br />I also want to give my opinion about HOW these products clean, because I have both the FLOORMATE and this EUROFLEX.  If you are trying to decide to go steam vs. scrub, here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide steam versus floor scrubber, consider the pro's and con's.<br /><br />EuroFlex or Monster Steam Mop<br />- Steam comes out from top & bottom<br />- Sterilizes floors which is great for kids<br />- Gentle on tile<br />- Lightweight and Easy to use<br />- Environmentally friendly; BUT...<br />- Pushes around dust & debris; sweep EVERYTHING up first<br />- Takes at least 5 minutes to warm up<br />- Handle is a bit flimsy<br /><br />FLOORMATE or other scrubber<br />- Scrubs floors using chemicals & water<br />- Vacuums up debris & scrub water into canister<br />- Very thoroughly cleans even tough stains; BUT...<br />- You have to "clean the cleaner" after each use<br />- You need to assemble and disassemble major parts after each use<br /><br />I use my Floormate once every two weeks and the steamer in between times.

Warning; Do Not Buy!
Within 3 months of buying this product, it stopped working. The red light that is supposed to turn green when reaching the right temperature to steam, stopped turning green as it should when heating the water and the steamer never even got warm ever again. Customer support for this product was of no help what so ever. When I reached them they said that the warranty had already expired (which was ONLY a 2 month warranty from purchase) and on top of that couldn't even offer any help on how to fix it on my own. Just wanted to warn you before you go and buy this steamer and are left in the same situation I was.

Avoid it if you can
I will make this as short as I can.  I am a long time user (~10yrs) of MS Office, many versions of both Word and Excel.  When I started having some compatibility issues with my old version, I decided to upgrade.  My advice to you is, at all costs, avoid upgrading if you can.  If you can choose a different product (non-Office), do it.<br />In Word especially, all the old interfaces have been completely redone, from the menus available right to the way help is (dis)organized.  Many of the old usability features, such as templates (for letters), how you interact with colors/fonts/etc., and how you print, preview, and perform simple functions, are gone or changed.<br />Microsoft apparently believes that manuals are a thing of the past, so finding out where my old options are, if they still exist, has been a chore of figuring out which of the dozens of help topics are actually relevant, and if they will help me (which they typically haven't).<br />Even in Excel there have been interface and usability changes that have made it difficult for me to work with it, given my long history with previous versions.  <br />My only caveat is that brand new users may find it easier to work with than old ones, but again, the poor help system would hinder even that, I would think.<br />Best of luck.

Stay Away as long as you can!
They changed everything!  In an effort to make it more user friendly, they've rearranged most of the controls.  Menus are replaced by headings.  It is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before.  Some of this will likely improve with use.<br /><br />WORD 2007 is constantly trying to think for you, auto formatting as you type.  However, it often isn't thinking what you are, and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings.  Particularly frustrating, when I "right-click" on a list to restart numbering at "A" (ie. after roman numeral II on an outline), WORD 2007 flatly refuses.  My research paper is now formated:<br />I.   Heading<br />  A. subpoint<br />  B. subpoint<br />  C. subpoin<br />II.  Heading<br />  D. subpoint<br />  E. subpoint<br />  F. subpoint<br />III.  Heading<br />  G. subpoint etc....etc...<br />This is ridiculous and inexcusable!  I also had to individually superscript 130+ footnotes.  Somehow, in changing the font from the Widows default "Calibri" back to "Time New Roman," the footnote setting was altered and I have yet to determine how to restore it.  However, if I open a new document it is fine, but I really don't want to retype a 30+ page research paper.<br /><br />POWERPOINT 2007 works well enough, compared to the older version.  They have added a few bell and whistles, but nothing that gets in the way.<br /><br />If you have to buy a new computer you're likely stuck with the new MS Office 2007.  But don't buy it until you have to.  It is NOT an upgrade from the previous two versions.

DO NOT BUY> Excel crashes, Word interface is a horrible mess
Where to start....????  SO many things are messed up in Office 2007.<br />Here are my top 3:<br />#1: Word/Excel/PPt: The ribbon interface changes things around so drastically that doing what was once simple things in Office XP/2003 is now a frustrating exercise in lost time and productivity.  <br />#2: Excel:  First, MS has a hotfix (a 32 MB download) for a math error (yes a math error).  Very few users will ever be likely to hit that value range on a calculated result, but still unacceptable for a mainstream number crunching program. But if you are one of those unfortunates, and the error ocurrs in a very large, complex spreadsheet, then the error could cost a business a fortune if it's not caught.<br />#3: Excel crashes if you try to specify a custom value range for chart error bars by selecting the appropriate row/columns from the worksheet (like you can in previous versions)... you have to enter them manually by typing the arcane "=Sheet1!$A$1:$Z$1".  Even if you try to click over to the worksheet while the entry box is open Excel will crash and you lose everything since the last Save.  This bug is probably lurking in other areas as many functions make the same calls to a common software modules where the bug really is located.<br /><br />There are many other bugs in this product too numerous to list here (goto the MS Discussion Groups on Office 2007 for more).<br /><br />Do not buy MS Office 2007 unless you like PAIN!!<br />

Finding really hard to relearn
The new look of the software is really confusing. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am knowledgeable enough that my family and friends call me to help them fix their computers and software problems, so I'm not a newbie either. I understand the basic idea that some things are on the screen for you to see, the things they consider to be the most important; but the things I use the most, like frame or underlining are now several click away and you can't customize the menus to what you like. They've put up what they think is important and that's it. If you use other features, you're out of luck... it's hunt and peck every time. You also have to learn to think the way they think. If you want to find a feature, it might not be in the menu set of screens you think. They may consider it a different type of feature than you think of it being, so you have start searching all the different sets of menus to find the feature you're looking for. Also, I like to copy and paste from boxes like this, when writing on the internet, for spell checking... well you can't do that anymore because when you paste back your text it appears in HTML format with all the weird stuff that goes along with it. It might be that I'm just too set in my ways and don't feel I have the time to learn a completely new software to do a simple letter. Maybe if I had the time to relearn everything I might find it easier, but I just don't have the weeks it would take to devote to the study of each product (Word, Excel mainly). I got the software and tried it for several months and went back to my old Word and Excel.

Microsoft Word 7
I am a basic user of word processing and had been using word 2003.  After<br />buying 2007 I bit the bullet and figured it would take a while to learn the new layout.  I have been at it 8 months now and I would rate the new version very poor.  It is difficult to find the most basic things like the margin ruler and basic features.  I still cannot number my pages on documents.  It automatically pops up old documents I do not want.  If you have the student version (still expensive) you cannot email your document directly (I spent two hours with customer support before realizing you couldn't do it).  I bought two of the books published by Microsoft but<br />had trouble finding the most basic things, like how to prevent this problem <br />of leaving a word by itself when formating the text and having to go back, back space insert etc<br /><br />In long lists the right and left spacing drifts causing multiple  but<br />maddening corrections.   It looks to me that it was just a rearrangement<br />of the 2003 program in order to sell  the "latest"  "update".  I consider the new .docx extension to be an example of dishonesty in business again trying to sell more product.  If you accidentally send<br />your "new 2007" .docx file to someone with older versions of Word (most of the world) they will not be able to open the file.  I think it is dishonesty in business to take out a basic feature of emailing a document<br />for the "student version"  to try to force the customer to buy the<br />full version.  I am going to call India and see if I can restore my<br />Word 2003 - of course I will have to pay.<br /><br />Thomas F. Kline MD.

Power users: don't buy this software!
Sure, this release has lots of "improvements".  I'll focus on Excel.  The biggest potential improvement is that the row and column maximums have been opened up.<br /><br />Beyond that, I've encountered nothing but problems.  <br />*  Once a document is saved in the new .xlsx format, Excel would not save back to the older .xls format.  Instead, it just hung.  <br />*  The software refused to change the limits on a date x-axis of my charts.  Instead it blithly reset the values back to the original values.<br />*  It is SLOW.  Clicking on a curve in a chart could take 10-20 seconds to respond.<br />*  Occasionally, Excel would just crash for no obvious reason.  The up side is that it would restart with opening the same workbooks.<br /><br />Also, as usual, I have been unable to find a place on the Microsoft web site to report such troubles.  All I've been able to find are FAQs that answer queries unrelated to the problems I've had.<br /><br />Maybe you can work with that.  I gave up and am just hoping that my new laptop is still functioning by the time that Microsoft gets around to noticing such glitches and releasing a service pack.  Maybe next year?

hideous software
This is the worst thing since the Office Assistant animated paper clip.  Forcing the "ribbon" on the user assumes that the user likes icons (I don't -- what's wrong with words??), and fills too much of the screen real estate.  Nothing is where it should be.  And what arrogance on the part of Microsoft to provide no alternate views, no "classic" view, just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons.  Another oppressive, giant waste of my time and money at the hands of Microsoft.

beware of ridiculous window titles
Before you buy this edition, be aware that the title of every document you open with it will include the phrase "non-commercial use". Apparently, the bean-counters at Microsoft decided that we need this daily reminder that we bought the cheapskate edition.

Incompatible with previous editions
Word documents created in Office 2007 now have the .docx extension which is incompatible with previous editions of Office and all 3rd party office applications such as Word Perfect, etc.<br /><br />If you load this on a couple work computers, you will have to go to every machine in the company and install a large "office compatibility pack" in order to read .docx files.  I have not been able to get the compatibility pack to download for Macintosh and the word on the street has been that Microsoft is ending support of Apple products.<br /><br />So if you want a whole lot of frustration and angry end-users, purchase Office 2007.  Otherwise stay with what you have or get OpenOffice (or NeoOffice for Macintosh).

Looks like Microsoft hired a Disney Cartoonist for this one ...
I was looking forward to this newest version. As soon as it finished loading, I started in to get some work done in Word and Excel. Little did I know there was a nasty shock waiting for me! What was this cartoon-like gibberish all over the screen? Where were the menu bars? Icons! Icons! Everywhere icons! All I could think was I had accidentally received the Student Edition for Pre-schoolers.<br /><br />It is a nightmare to navigate. If you scroll over one of the cartoon icons; you get a pull-down menu that makes a Rubik's Cube look easy. I think MS forgot the most important rule of all - K.I.S.S.<br /><br />I have used Excel and Word almost every day for the last ten years. Like others who have commented on this new version, I make my own menu/tool bars and can navigate through the programs with no problems. There are always a few adjustments when a newer version arrives which is fine. But this? Forget it! <br /><br />I have removed 2007 and reloaded 2003. Back to the drawing board on this one Microsoft! Dump the cutesy and give us streamlined, neat, usable programs.<br />

You will be lost for weeks or maybe longer
I installed and tried to use this new version.  The user interface is completely different.  I went online at Microsoft to see what this was all about.  They call it a "Ribbon".  What a mess.  I can't find anything.<br />It seems like it takes me so much extra time to do the most basic operations.  If you have an older version of Office and it is working well for you, I highly recommend just sticking with it until Microsoft fixes it somehow.  After reading reviews at other sites, I can't believe it actually had 4 stars on Amazon.  On CNET, it was 5 out of 10.  I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it.  I felt like I was driving a car with square wheels.  If it isn't broken, don't break it.  The file conversion thing is also a lot of trouble to deal with.

User friendly? My A**
Wow, I've never felt the need to write a review before, but Microsoft 2007 is horrible. I bought it for my laptop because I need it for school, but I really regret it. I wish I had bought 2003 instead; it's so much easier to use than 2007. This edition I use mainly for Word, but I've also used Powerpoint. At first I thought it was going to take a little time to get used to, but then it would be an upgrade from the old version. How wrong I was. I've had it installed for over 2 months and it's gotten no better. One thing I've noticed is that it keeps trying to change things without me telling to, such as when I'm trying to format my document, create an outline, tab correctly to type an MLA bibliography, everything - it's trying to help by assuming I meant to do something (and thus doing it for me) when I REALLY don't want to! It's horrible! And forget the help button too - it doesn't exist in this version. All I'm trying to do is get my work done for school, but it takes me FOREVER just trying to get it the way it has to be formatted becase that's not how Word 2007 wants it to look. This is a pain in my a**, and my friends who have this and are used to 2003 all agree with me - why is it so difficult? It really shouldn't be. So I urge you all - look at 2003 if you have the option, it's much easier to use even if it doesn't have the spiffy new appearance of 2007.

Data courption and other problems
I recently purchased Windows Vista and Office 2007 Home. When dealing with files saved under Word 2003 I had several instances of 2007 being unable to reconvert the temporary file word uses while editing a document back into a word file, corrupting the file and causing word to crash. Word did not allow me to recover the document and continued to do this to a number of other important files, without a chance for recovery. My documents are to important to trust to Microsoft's blunders. I dumped Office and I now use the free Openoffice suite. Thanks for nothing Microsoft. <br />

No Class - and Overpriced.
This magazine is okay. There are things about it, however, which are downright awful. As an example, they often put "racy" pictures in the magazine - not nudity, but this magazine is NOT appropriate for young people. I have kids, and so I can't leave this lying around. It's really too bad. It's just low-class lazy graphics work (not college degree print-design quality). <br />Also, I don't want the CD. It's worthless. For example - they put a DEMO for "Ghost Recon" - a 5-year old game on the disc once! Hahah. It's not worth ten cents. Give us a discount for a subscription WITHOUT the stupid CD. Nobody wants the CD - drop the price, and stop shipping the stupid coaster.

Warning! Always a month delay!
I got a 1 year subscription through Amazon with a great half price discount. <br />The magazine is good. <br />However, I always get the magazine a month after it has been released on the street.<br />May be, this is why I got it cheap. <br />Anyway, people need to aware they may possible to get it late (a month later).<br />

Don't do it! -- Pick one of these magazines instead
Maxim rode the men's magazine gold rush in the late 1990s, leading Stuff, FHM and a host of other PG-13 fare that filled the convenience store racks as Playboy, Penthouse and the hard cores were either dropped completely or were tucked behind the clerk hidden behind individual black plastic wrappers.<br /><br />Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today. If you were unfortunate enough to receive a gift subscription to Maxim or, worse yet, bought one for yourself, you can no doubt bear witness to the decay. The magazine simply isn't interesting or compelling to read. You could find more of everything - women, entertainment, food and fashion - in a 10-minute Google search.<br /><br />Ask yourself, why are you buying a men's magazine?<br /><br />Want to admire beautiful women? Choose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HWY1PG">Playboy</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1R2G8">Penthouse</a>.<br /><br />Want to stay healthy and fit? Choose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N7RD">Men's Health</a> (preferred) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023J4FW">Men's Fitness</a> (for younger audiences).<br /><br />Want to peruse fashion and lifestyle? Choose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M06NP4">Esquire</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N7QI">GQ</a> (beware the cologne samples though).<br /><br />Want a little of everything?

Maxim has gone downhill big time
I've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine. Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription.

Cover to cover advertising, virtually zero content
Once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover.  Unfortunately they've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising.  As the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual "content" in about an hour.  The rest is advertising and BS.  This magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago.  Just let it die already like it's supposed to.

maxim: for people who want to pay for advertisements
i've bought a few copies of this magazine, but none in over a year.  maxim is chock full of repetitive sex stories and media-savvy "babes" that conveniently pose at the same time their new CDs or movies are about to come out.  a typical issue is 175 pages of advertising (counting those airbrushed pictorials) and maybe 25 pages of actual content, most of which is either recycled from previous maxims or adapted from other magazines.<p>i find it hilarious that the same "manly man" guys who make fun of oprah-watching females buy this magazine and claim it the greatest thing on the newsstand, when it's really just the same shallow junk as any housewife-friendly talk show.  it's not that i hate this magazine, i just think it's really really lame.

I would have given it zero stars, but...
...1) I can't; <br />2) on second thought, it deserves at least one star for having some silly, funny stuff that you don't find in other magazines.<br /><br />That said, it is grossly overrated. How is it consistently in the top sellers list? Well, there are as many millions of folks with a below average IQ as there are above average. It's too bad they can't play up the silly humor a bit more while leaving the abhorrent juvenileness out. The images are generally trashy and sometimes airbrushed to the point that it looks fake and ridiculous--they could improve the quality of the photos a LOT. <br /><br />Admit it, you would probably hide an issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected. Doesn't that say it all? Reconsider the standards you are setting for yourself, and respect your own brain, too.

Nothing but fluff
This magazine is nothing more than Cosmo for men.  How to make your sex life better, how to bag the hottest chick, blah blah blah.  Face it, if you're looking for a magazine to make your sex life better, it won't work.  If you're looking for soft porn, you can download more off the Internet than you'd ever dream about getting in hard print.

Get this ... mag off the shelves please!
Maxim started out as a great British mix of babes and guy reading style mag, with nice covers, interesting women featured, with nice photography and humorous articles.  Since it split into two versions (US & UK), the US one went completely downhill.  Less of a mag (but bigger than the UK because of so many ads) the photography of this magazine has to be just about the worst of any of the men's magazines on the shelf.  Just look closely at any cover on the shelf.    The women do not look human, they look like animation.  WAY TOO MUCH AIRBRUSHING IN PHOTOSHOP guys.  I love looking at women, but real photos please, not digital nightmares.  An awful looking mag.

Maxim is trash.
I don't know what I was thinking.  I thought Maxim was more like a "Men's issues/health/style/etc." type magazine.  It's soft porn, mostly.  The articles are uninteresting and poorly written.  In fact, it feels a lot like reading a 15 year old boy's school homework, if he could write with no inhibitions nor worry of getting in trouble for honesty.  I would know, I'm a teacher, and this magazine has the sophistication level of just that, a 15 year old boy.

Great magazine, HORRIBLE subscription service!
My rating is for the overall package of magazine and subscription service.<br /><br />The subscriptions are handled by BuySub and they appear to be totally incompetent. I ordered Popular Mechanics and several other magazine subscriptions.  I have an Amazon account, my address is totally correct, I was charged for the subscriptions, and all were fine except the one handled by BuySub ... somehow the goons at BuySub  screwed up my address so badly that the USPS refused to deliver the magazine.  BuySub/Hearst offers no phone call and their "Contact Us" page doesn't always work, so I had to resort to sending queries via email.  I corrected my address and explaind that I was missing 2 issues according to their record of when my subscription started.  They responded telling me that they would send only 1 of the 2 issues.  They never sent that issue, nor did my subscription resume after I corrected the address.  I contacted them again and told them I was now missing 3 issues and told them they needed to send the issues or extend my subscription. They responded with "Your request to cancel your subscription has been received".<br /><br />TOTAL INCOMPETENCE!  I did not request to cancel my subscription, I requested the missing issues or an extension.  If they're going to be idiots and cancel my subscription, could they tell me if I'm being reimbursed?  I had to respond again, and now I'm going to contact my credit card company and see if they can do anything for me. <br /><br />NEVER AGAIN will I subscribe to any magazine handled by BuySub.  I have wasted a huge amount of time trying to correct the mistakes that THEY made.  They took my money right away and didn't deliver. Totally shabby.<br />

Subscription fulfillment on this is very poor.  I ordered in July and still haven't received the 1st issue as of the end of October.

2 months- still waiting for my order
There's nothing wrong with Popular Mechanics, but the company that handles the subscriptions is apparently completely incompetent.

It's now the middle of January and I have sent 2 emails to that company and still have not received a single issue. Buyer beware.

I ****ing hate Wired
Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter.<br />Generally, Wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory. This attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and IT industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst, desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying, know-it-all glory. Any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths, shoddy reasoning, and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss, Yuppie/GenXer-targeted corporate mind-poison (advertising).<br />Isn't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin, double-talk, and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent, absurd bravado of Battle Bot pre-match trash talk? People know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can, quite plausibly, save it. This magazine could evangelize for technology's promise and educate about its current and future potential. Instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for "hip" that forwards an attitude rather than a message, with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy, having more in common with advertising than edification.

Jumped the shark.
This magazine used to be a playground for billionaire boys and their extravagant toys.  Once they began venturing into eco-politics (Inconvenient Truths: Get Ready to Rethink What It Means to Be Green) they entered an arena that is ill suited for jock humor and contrarian jibes.  Telling folks to keep their SUV's and embrace the nukes while snarkilly saying "Screw the Spotted Owl" is poor taste at the very best, and in these times of economic crisis, really just point to the "consume more" mentality that got us into our present situation of global recession.  <br /><br />I do like this magazine for the reviews they print on the latest gadgets and computer equipment, but they often present a few subjects to review with big pictures and tight three sentence blurbs with a few pros and cons about the device.  I find that other publications can do a much better job reviewing technology far better and don't push a bunch of pre-processed Kulture on you.<br /><br />I had hoped that Wired would fill the gap that Omni magazine had left when it folded up in 1996, but that would require the editors to get over how cool they think they are.  They seem to be more interested in catering to the cynical, high-fiving, light beer drinking crowd, as they sense that the "geek" social movement is going more mainstream and frat-boy approved.  <br /><br />With that in mind, I'll pass on renewing my subscription. <br /><br />

I found this magazine to be mostly ads, and the articles were not at all what I expected. Seems more like opinions then researched articles. I guess I missed the true point of this magazine, not at all what I expected. I'm 50 and not really a geek, just love techno stuff, but didn't find this very helpful to me. I have never cancelled a subscription to a magazine before this, but in this case I had to.

Can not read it - literally - They use a tiny size 6 font everywhere to make room for more ads
While they have occasional good articles, the science and technology details are low and not what I expected.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that I can not read the magazine - literally!  In order to make more room for more pages of glossy paid advertisemets they print their articles using the most tiny print font I have ever seen in any printed magazine.  My eyes are fine; I read many magazines and all others with no trouble.  They must be using a size 6 font or smaller! <br /><br />-Ed

More than half ads
When I received my first issue, I was impressed at just how large the magazine was.  At some 230 page long, it dwarfs every other magazine I receive.<br /><br />But when I actually sat down to read the thing, I realized it was a total waste of money.  I've never seen a magazine with this many advertisements.  More than half the pages are ads.  The few articles there are have so little meat to them, it's not worth the effort of flipping through all the ads.  I'm very disappointed.

Beware of the billing agencies!
Popular Science is among many of the magazines currently engaging in the practice of contracting out billing...which then gets subcontracted and sometimes sub-subcontracted out. This means you may have to contact three or four different companies via half a dozen (or more) phone numbers with subscription-related issues. <br /><br />In fact, one subagency, Magazine Billing Services, has closed down their call center, so cancelation requests must be sent by snail mail only. (We've also seen notices from and numbers for Publishers Billing Agency and Publishers Unlimited, in addition to Popular Science's direct numbers.) <br /><br />Additionally, renewal notices are sent out regardless of the actual expiration date. If subscribers aren't vigilant, they'll find themselves paying for 20 year's worth of subscriptions. And then, due to the entanglement of companies described above, it will take days of calling, holding and letter writing to get the problem of the deceptive renewal notices straightened out. <br /><br />If that particular agency wasn't involved in that particular renewal notice that was responded to (and we've received "renewal" notices from all of them simultaneously), then the subscriber gets continually redirected. Get used to hearing the phrase, "I can't help you with that." Also get used to requests taking months or more to be processed (if they get processed at all) and get used to getting no responses from emailed queries, requests or complaints.<br /><br />This is becoming an increasingly common practice, but that doesn't mean consumers have to put up with it. If Popular Science believes it's good customer service to subcontract out billing and relentlessly pepper subscribers with intentionally deceptive "renewal" notices, they can keep their rag of a magazine.

where's my magazine dudes?
5 months and numerous phone calls to the subscription peddler and still not one single magazine has been delivered! i strongly urge the readers to not buy the subscription here and go directly to the Popular Science site, that is, if you actually want to read the magazine.

Just Okay
I just received my screen protector and it's not all that great.  It says it's matte finish and adds no glare, but it's almost reflective enough to use as a mirror.  The little installation tool left little scratches all over the protector and the cleaning cloth doesn't remove them, and there's still a few bubbles.  I don't recommend peeling it off and reinstalling - the bubbles and scratches got worse.  Good luck - I really hope they make another one - Preferably MADE IN AMERICA instead of CHINA.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Too much glare, don't buy it
The installation was fairly easy.  I started at the top and slowly worked my way down.  There was a sticker on each side to make peeling the back off easier.  However removing the front sticker proved very difficult and I had to use WD-40 to remove the gunk left behind.  And it turns out there are not two layers like I thought, there are THREE layers.  A back that you peel off, a front that you peel off after applying, then the middle "protective" layer.<br /><br />In the end, this product lasted barely a day on my Kindle DX.  The glare was horrible.  And like other have said, you can pretty much see yourself well enough to shave or comb your hair.  Which meant I had to carefully position the Kindle to read without seeing every light source in the room.<br /><br />This product is now in my trash can.  Stick with the default non-glare screen on the Kindle and just be careful not to scratch it.

As much as I wanted a protective sheet for my new Kindle, this one would not apply without bubbles.  I threw it in the trash.<br />

Don't Buy
Just received my screen protector and tried to install it. First of all it is <br />not straight so no matter what I do, it overlaps the screen on one end or the other. Very frustrating. Maybe I can trim it, but I feel I shouldn't have <br />to after spending $7.95 plus shipping for a small piece of plastic. <br />The glare is horrible.

Too shiny!
It was a real hassle to apply this screen protector without leaving huge air bubbles, and was actually a bit too large to fit the screen.  When I started reading with it in place, I discovered that the highly reflective surface made reading difficult.  I pulled it off and threw it away.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
A Piece of Crap!
I bought this product , thinking it would be the similar to the Invisible Shield I put on my cell phone screen - NOT!  It was hard to put on - It came with a sticker that you are suppose to use to remove it from the sticker backer that will not come off after - left a sticky mess in the corner. I tried to remove it with stick remover and it made the film all smudgy. I had bubbles too and it created a glare on the screen.  I took it off and put it in the trash.  DON'T BUY !!!
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
$7.52 + shipping wasted ...
It could be just my clumsy fingers, but I found the screen protector difficult to apply correctly. Never did get it on right, and by the time I had it positioned reasonably straight, I had fingerprints on the sticky side that, of course, don't come off.  I resigned myself to a few smudges but then encountered a million bubbles that I couldn't press out. Out of frustration, I threw it in the trash. In theory, it's a good idea, but I can't imagine it being reusable. If you get scratches on it, the reading experience isn't as enjoyable - you wouldn't reuse your cell phone protector, would you? That's just my experience - others may have better luck with it.

Kindle DX Premium Screen Protector
The screen protector was difficult to place squarely on the screen. The air bubbles were difficult to remove. To correct the placement of the screen protector it was difficult to remove.

Screen protector is worthless.  Not a good value.
This device was not a good value.  It did not last 2 weeks until it started peeling off of the Kindle.  I finally took it off because of the loose edges. Also, when I used the tabs for placement they remained sticky on the front side consequently dirt and lent adhered to the sticky place and it was hard to read the first word of the page on the screen. I would like my money back.  I have been trying to get my credit card to cancel payment.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Horrible!
This screen protector is far below the quality that you typically see for devices like iPods and iPhones. It is definitely NOT matte and in fact is so reflective it makes it almost impossible to read with a book light in reduced light environments without continually having to shift the angle of the light as you read on the page. I could never get all the bubbles out and it arrived already scratched.<br /><br />Strongly recommend AGAINST.

worst thing that I bought for my kindle
I have purchased a few products for my kindle dx and this was the worst.  I threw it away the same day that I got it.  It seemed strong and that it wouldn't interfere with reading, but there was no way to get rid of the air bubbles no matter how many times I tried.  I was worried about damaging my screen by trying to get rid of the air bubbles.  <br /><br />If you want to be angry and yell at your spouse for no reason, or if you are trying to drive someone insane then I would recommend buying it.  Otherwise save your money, your marriage, and your sanity.

Product failed and seller offers minimal support
I purchased this product in February and it arrived without instructions.  Since this isn't rocket science I played with it and was able to get it to work fairly well.  Because I am not in my car too often I initially accepted the abundance of static and the need to frequently change stations so that the static would not overwhelm what was playing on my iPod Classic.  After taking some time and scanning the entire FM dial I finally found a couple of stations where the static was minimal and I could reasonably enjoy the device.  Of note, the frequency buttons on the transmitter and remote worked backwards.  Push the Up button and the frequency went down.  Push the Down button and the frequency went up.  Again, I tolerated this since it was at least consistent and I didn't use it often.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago (April) the display would not light and the device stopped working.  I called the seller (BargainCell) and their response was that since it was over 30 days from the date of purchase, the "best" they could do was to sell me another one at half price.  In my opinion, the "best" they could do was replace the defective product.  The customer service rep. also offered to send me instructions to get it to work again.  What I got from the representative was nine steps written in broken English that are absolutely useless.<br /><br />I will be looking for another transmitter and it will not be coming from BargainCell.<br />
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Do not buy, terrible quality.
I got this product for 15 dollars and it wasn't even worth that. The FM transmitter worked very well at first and it charged my iPod but after one use, IT BROKE! It's very cheaply made and is terrible quality. If your looking for an FM radio transmitter and is hesitating between this one and another FM transmitter, let me help you out, DON'T BUY THIS ONE! Your probably better off buying brand name products like Belkin, etc.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
NOT COMPATIBLE FOR TOUCH
This product does not charge IPOD TOUCH 2G as I found too late after I received it. The FM transmission quality is also poor with lot of hissing noise, more so when in traffic with other vehicles in close proximity.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Transmission - fine, socket plug and cradle - miserable piece of garbage
The FM Transmission for the unit is fairly decent.  I found that there is usually at least one station that works with minimal hiss.  If you listen very carefully, however, you do hear hiss.  May or may not be a problem for you depending on your auto's sound proofing; i.e. if you are traveling down the freeway, the hiss "disappears" (masked by the freeway noise).<br /><br />The interface for this product however, is miserable and shameful.  Where to begin. . .<br /><br />First, the base/cradle only has two ranges of motion:  circular, by rotating the plug in the cigarette lighter socket; vertical, by angling the base up and down on the plug.  The missing key here is the horizontal axis.  (Think yaw, pitch, and roll in aeronautical terminology.)  I am unable to position it so that it is convenient to reach/see and doesn't get in the way of the gear shift, temperature controls, the car stereo, etc.<br /><br />Second, the whole think should have the option of window-mounting; i.e. like this product for my iPaq:<br /><br />http://www.gomadic.com/hp-ipaq-hw6965---hw-6965-car-windshield-holder-charger.html<br /><br />So, buy this thing if you have nothing surrounding the 12v socket in your car.  Otherwise, feel free to purchase this and then kick yourself in the pants.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
DO NOT BUY
This is NOT made by Apple as the title makes it sound.  It does not automatically find the best channel and it needs constant attention to ensure a static free experience, making it a hazard for driving.  If you have limited space at your lighter area, this is not a good choice.<br /><br />It does hold the Classic iPod firmly in place and does fairly well with the squarish nano.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Buyer Beware: Do Not Buy This, Very Poor Quality
It is poorly built. The FM transmitter worked for the first ten minutes and stopped working after that, then we could never get it to work again. I was very disappointed. The remote does not work and never did. We opened it and from the time we opened it, the only thing that worked was the charger. Also, it is very difficult to turn it off and on, the power button barely works and sometimes doesn't work at all. This was a Christmas gift and I felt cautious about buying it. I should have listened to the other people who reviewed this before. I  got ripped off. This product should be removed from Amazon. It looks good, but trust me, that's the only good thing about it.

Lasted Two Whole Weeks!
This unit worked great...for two weeks. Also, it could only be used off of the hard wired Aux outlet. Would not work in the ignition Aux outlet. The electrical contact button on the bottom is either too sensitive or the side contacts don't project enough, because the unit continually needed pushed back in the outlet due to popping out. In the end, the display went out and it would not change channels. I just found out that Apple makes a cradle and will try it next.

Major problems, which Netgear has acknowledged - AVOID
Do NOT purchase this router.  I have been a happy Netgear customer in the past, and am technical enough to keep both home and small office wireless networks running fine, but this model has a hardware problem that Netgear tech support has finally acknowledged, but for which they are not providing an adequate fix.  As others have mentioned, the router will often drop connectivity, and rebooting is the only solution.  I bought one, had these problems start (luckily within the 90 day tech support window), and returned the router to Netgear (at my expense) in exchange for another one, which demonstrated the SAME problem less than 24 hours after installation.  After yet another long call to India the latest tech support rep acknowledged that lots of these models are having the same problem, and upgrading to the latest firmware (which I did immediately upon installing both of these routers) won't fix it, so her solution was... send this one back (AGAIN at my expense) and they would send me yet another one of the SAME model, which she (for no defensible reason) assures me will work.  For more background please see the Netgear tech support forums, where you will see scores of people experiencing the same problem and the same non-solution from Netgear.  Save yourself the trouble and buy a different wireless router.

Easy to install, hopeless for heavy use
I bought one of these to replace an SMC7004AWBR which stopped allowing admin logins and wouldn't reset to factory defaults.<br /><br />It installed like a dream, was really easy to set up, and worked fine--at first. Unfortunately, I work from home as a software engineer and system admin, and really need a reliable router--and this isn't it. Once I open too many simultaneous TCP connections, it'll crash--the lights blink as if it's still working, but it stops actually routing packets.<br /><br />I've tried a firmware upgrade, I've tried changing the MTU size, and next I think I'm going to try another brand of router...  If you use BitTorrent, RSS aggregators, or other software that opens lots of TCP connections, avoid this router. Similarly, if you have several computers in simultaneous use, this device will only frustrate you.

Do not buy this router.
I bought a Netgear WGR614 (version 6) router to front-end a pair<br />of networks connecting to Comcast cable.  The network was<br />already up and running, I simply wanted to swap out an Airport<br />Extreme that was working fine in that location.<br /><br />The Netgear WGR614 was easy to configure.<br /><br />The problem is the Netgear WGR614 can't handle any reasonable<br />DNS load.  If I connected my laptop directly to the Comcast<br />network, I could get DNS answers from Comcast's servers as fast<br />as I could send them.  If I put the Netgear WGR614 between my <br />laptop and Comcast, 1 or 2 out of each 10-15 DNS requests would     <br />time out.  If I connected the mail servers to the Netgear<br />WGR614, 5 out of 10 DNS requests would time out, and I would <br />often see strings of 10-20 DNS requests time out in a row.  This<br />was severely damaging to the network: browser URL lookups would<br />fail, host lookups for spam filtering would fail, and so on.<br /><br />Netgear support was easy to get in touch with, and initially<br />responsive.  However, once we got through the basics (is the<br />power on?) all they could suggest was manually configuring all<br />of the computers behind the router to use static routes to the<br />name servers (which I wasn't willing to do, and, in a simple<br />test failed to fix the problem), or upgrade the firmware to a<br />beta release, version 1.0.7.  I did upgrade the firmware, but<br />it had no effect at all on the problem.<br /><br />Netgear support told me twice they would escalate my support<br />case to "level 2", but after each escalation, I never heard<br />from them again.<br /><br />Remember the Airport Extreme had no problem working in this<br />location?  After Netgear support failed to fix the problem, I<br />bought a Linksys WRT54G, it handles the DSN request load just<br />fine!

it's an excellent paperweight
Wow.  This thing is a piece of junk.  I can sometimes get service for days on end, but then it'll drop me and there's no way to get reconnected.  I mean, I can unplug the unit, and it will, in fact, connect me, but it's short lived.  I've spent many an afternoon walking in between the living room and office (where the router is stored), unplugging and plugging the unit back in, checking my computer, ad nauseum.  It'll connect me for literally seconds before I'm dropped again.  I usually give up and go use my hardwired desktop.  When I save the money up to get another brand I can't wait to take this one out to the backyard with a baseball bat.  <br /><br />I implore you, do NOT buy one of these if you value your sanity. It will push you over the edge.  <br /><br />By the way, i'm writing this review at work.  I've tried many times at home on the laptop, but I lose the connection before I can finish.  <br /><br />Oh, and customer service is an utter joke.<br /><br />*****update*****<br /><br />i finally pulled the plug on this dog and took it to the woodshed.  beat it to little bits with a baseball bat.  i feel so much better.

Lot of great features...hardware issues....
I bought this for the faster 54Mb rate...it is fast. BUT a few problems or differences in expectations were encountered...<p>I have used D-link, linksys, netgear, cisco, USR and belkin wireless  products. The transmit strength on this compact WGR614 is pretty strong. maybe it's a factor of the 802.11G...it seemed to be as strong as the cisco gear which is phenomenal in itself. The wireless card from netgear for 54G is pretty strong also. I think belkin was the worst, followed up by USRobotics which was also pretty weak, then linksys, then d-link.<p>Connection was extremely easy. I just unplugged the D-link wireless and put in the Netgear. It found the internet automatically, configured itself for access and spoofed the mac address automatically. Something that is great for newbies.<p>MAJOR PROBLEM: I use my cable (comcast-which blows chow most of the time...) to access internet to use stock trading software and as such, is a streaming data stream through a VPN. This router claims VPN pass through...but unless you know which ports to open up..it makes it somewhat difficult to use &quot;real&quot; VPN because all you're doing is opening raw ports to the internet to IP addresses behind the router. This is a pretty big security concern IMO. I just moved all my data from the trading computer to another server that doesn't have ports open...but a pain nonetheless...<p>anyhow, back to the main problem. This netgear router tends to just stop routing...no joke. the connection lights with the internet remain ok, but the router just freezes, stops working and then works again in a few minutes...I've contacted tech support but the Netgear technical support is a complete joke. You wait on hold for 30 minutes (an eternity it felt like) EACH time and then get connected with India..yes, they outsource, and some of the tech folks in India speak faster english with major accents than some spitfire hispanics speaking spanish...needless to say, I had to remind them to slow down and enunciate so I could hear what they were saying..<p>Bottom line, tech support is a joke, if you have a problem. you're on your own...Ive upgraded the firmware TWICE now, even to the new unsupported &quot;beta&quot; to try and stop this freezing...to no avail. I've gone back to my old D-link and it works wonders...go figure...<p>I'm going to order one more netgear router and if that freezes too..then i think there is a hardware/firmware issue...<p>i'm jinxed folks :-)

The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced
Constantly had to reboot due to lost signal. Other technical problems which are constantly mentioned in other reviews. Indian tech support while done well by other companies is extremely painful to use. If you need help ninety days after you purchase the product it would be less expensive to buy another router.Three days and two tech support emails (which were replied to at 3:00 am 17 hours after they were sent)later problem unresolved due to generic information sent from company. Case number given was useless. Netgear does not stand by their product and their customer service is the absolute worst and I can not stress this enough THE ABSOLUTE WORST I have experienced. I am not without computer and technical skills and god help anyone who encounters this company who is void of computer and technical skills. If you see this product turn around and run do not walk away.

Wireless connection randomly drops
Many other reviewers here have said it, and they're all right: the wireless connection on this device randomly drops. Sometimes I will start my laptop up, and it will connect to this router, but when I try to browse the internet, nothing happens. My browser just says "Waiting on amazon.com," and nothing happens. On other occasions I will be surfing the Web just fine, then all of a sudden the connection stops working.<br /><br />When the connection randomly drops, it's not like it's my ISP's fault because the hard-wired connection still works fine. It's just the wireless that stops working. Rebooting the router (which is poorly designed because it lacks a power switch--the only way to reboot is by unplugging it) does solve the problem...until the next time. Typically the connection goes out at least once a day.<br /><br />I have tried moving the router to a different physical location, changing the wireless communication channel, and upgrading the firmware from the Netgear website. Still the router continues to randomly drop the connection.<br /><br />This is a piece of junk. Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />[edit] Tried the Dlink DGL-4300 router. It's expensive, but worth it. No connection drops at all. Looking forward to smashing this Netgear garbage.

Bad wireless router that replaced worse wireless router
This replaced a Netgear BEFW11S4 router, which was hideously inept at keeping its wireless signal up or doing port-forwarding.  After buying the Netgear, which I thought was a better brand, I'm not sure I'm much better off.<br /><br />As I work, I can see the wireless signal drop from full strength to nothing for a few seconds, then come back.  At other times, I've turned on a computer to find the signal gone and unwilling to come back - this can be fixed by plugging into an ethernet port, visiting the configuration page and simply "OK"ing the wireless settings, without changing anything.  Of course, if ethernet were convenient to me, I wouldn't need the wireless.  As it is, a device that fails every few days and needs to be reset is wholly unacceptable.  It is better than the Linksys only because resetting the Linksys didn't always work, and on the Netgear, resetting does always work.<br /><br />Nevertheless, home users shouldn't have to baby their network devices, particularly if you need wireless because your computer is physically nowhere near your DSL terminal or cable modem.  This class of devices cannot fail, and even with the latest firmware this one does, a lot.  One star.<br /><br />Update: 8/04.  The internet port, which connects the router to the DSL modem, died this week.  I put in a report on the tech support page, detailing what had happened and what I'd done to isolate the problem, and I got a response three days later (24 hours, my butt).  The response was a typically patronizing walkthrough of the most basic setup and testing that you can get to the configuration page.  Well, of course, I can get to the configuration page - it's getting from the router to the internet (specifically, to the DSL modem) that's busted.  Oh, and the e-mail was barely in English - more offshored support from a company that sees customers as nothing more than expense.  Thank goodness these things are getting reasonably inexpensive, because you have to assume at this point that once a router dies, it's dead forever, and the warranty is worthless if you can't get an RMA.

Works well, for a while. . .
I bought this router when I came to college.  Very easy to set up, it automatically detects most of the settings and does most of the work for you.  I get good speed and reception.<br /><br />When it works at all.<br /><br />Every hour to two hours, the router will stop working.  And I don't mean slow down, or make your multiplayer Halo game start lagging. I mean the router will stop functioning alltogether, drop all wireless clients, and refuse to give internet access until I unplug it and plug it back in.  After arguing with Netgear's tech support (five different agents, four of them in India, none of whom knew how to do anything but read off a checklist, and one of whom tried to convince me that this is actually normal operation), I finally got a replacement, and that one works even worse than the original.  I'm scrapping the new one and getting a Linksys, which I had at home and which worked for 5 years straight with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />Ironically, as I was attempting to post this review, the router died on me.

What Cheap Can Buy
I won't beat around the bush, this is a terrible product.  I was looking for something to allow Mic level recordings on my computer (Macbook Pro) and I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money on an iMic.  I found this remarkably cheaper device, and decided to try it instead.  When I got it, the first thing I thought upon seeing the packaging was how un-professional it looked.  The box looks like something someone printed off their computer, and it even had spelling errors on it.  When I popped the device out of the box it came apart in my hand.  Right then I knew I had made a mistake.  It comes with a minidisc that 1. doesn't fit in a mac, and 2. only had PC software on it.  Of course the box and the product page don't say what platform this device is for, and indeed my Mac did recognize it when plugged in.  However, when I switched over to USB audio out, my ears were nearly blown out.  There was absolutely no way to control the volume.  Upon plugging in a Mic, I found the device didn't even respond  The audio in channel lights up half way as though it's picking up some signal, but it doesn't make a sound (tested with Line In and Garage Band and no response).  This is a shoddy, unprofessional product that should be avoided at all cost.  Don't be cheap, I'm sure the iMic is loads better.

Good Output - Terrible Input
For speakers or headset this produces an acceptable sound. However, the speaker input produces low volume fuzzy and crackly noise. I tried in two PC's running XP and Vista with the same results.  Plug the same mike into the rear input jacks and the mike works fine.  If you need to use just the speaker output on this it works fine.  I bought it to use for Skype, but it is useless for that.

product not as described
The description of this product implies that it has a condenser microphone.  This is incorrect - all it has is a microphone jack.  No built-in microphone.  Other than that, it is a nifty little device, although I have to agree the sound quality is poor.  It was instantly recognized however and worked with no driver installation (good thing too since it comes with no disc).  All in all I wish I had not bothered with it since what I really wanted was a microphone.  I sent email to the seller and they did not even respond ... not even an auto generated email.

Pretty much worthless
Bought this to replace the broken headphone jack on my computer; product came without any drivers, and the driver automatically installed by Windows didn't even allow me to control the volume, rendering the product useless with headphones.<br /><br />Also, the sound quality was HORRIBLE. I'm not just being dramatic. It was really sincerely awful. Sounded something like an mp3 compressed at 64 kbps.<br /><br />Not worth what I paid for shipping. I'm not exactly sure what this product is even manufactured for... but it certainly doesn't have any functionality in my life.

All around awful
The headphone jack in my computer broke, so I needed an alternative to be able to plug in my speakers. I would have been better off just buying new USB speakers instead of trying this.  WOW the audio is bad.  Just really, really, really bad.  When playing video, the audio is tolerable, but playing any music is out of the question unless you like garbled, fuzzy, crackling sounds.  Ugh.  I guess you get what you pay for.

Horrible
As others have mentioned, there really isn't a volume setting for this device--it's either on REALLY LOUD or off. This product produces a hideous, loud buzz when hooked up to a Y cable or my Xenyx 502 mixer. I wasn't expecting much in audio fidelity from this device, but this is simply unusable. DO NOT BUY.

Pro: Cheap<br />Con: Sounds like audio from a super cheap usb sound card. <br /><br />I've used usb sound devices in the past that weren't too much more expensive than this one, and they actually sounded good.  I listened to 3 songs on this bad boy and pulled it out of my computer.  I'll keep it around just in case my mic jack ever goes out, but most likely it will sit in my closet and collect dust until I throw it away. <br /><br />

Waste of money
I ordered two of these (since they're so small they would be easy to lose). With a MacBook, I got an unacceptable amount of hum and distortion on both of them. Not just a "little" bit bad but REALLY bad sound. Absolutely useless. I didn't even bother to try the microphone.

Just don't bump it.
So I hooked this bad boy up to my computer 1/15/10. I come home the night of 1/17, bump it as I sit down at my PC, and it stops working. For the short time I used it, it was exactly what I wanted it to be. But now, it is nothing but landfill. I do not recommend anyone buy this item.

Poor sound quality
The sound quality is terrible.  I wanted to use this to make Skype calls, but it didn't work well.  Unfortunately, I had to use a more expensive USB headset in the end.

Don't buy it!
The idea was a good one. However, the execution is terrible. The adapter didn't even make it out of the box before it broke in half. The entire shell split in two and fell off the inner card.  You can almost see that in the picture of the item in the desciption. Sorry I missed it. The adapter has been returned.

UltraSuck
I'd give these a zero rating if I could. I thought they would be a good value, but they only have about 25% (or less) the power of a good name brand battery. I tried these in my pager and they only last about a week vs. 4-6 weeks for a good battery. I used them in a label maker and I could only print 4 labels before they died. I'm half way done with a 100 pack and they all have the same short life.

The bad reviews don't do these justice.....
Bought some of these at Micro Center. Absolute worst batteries I've ever purchased. More than half were dead out of the box. Not even good for remotes. Had to cycle through batteries in search of two good ones just to get a channel change. In no way is the price worth the stress or the number of batteries that actually worked. Winning combinations usually lasted a week anyway. An 8 pack of Duracell would beat these. Awful experience.

Fraud
There should be some kind of law against selling items this poor in quality. Shame on Amazon for peddling these batteries.<br /><br />These<br />1) Leak - and damage to the electronics far exceed the cost of these batteries.<br />2) Have short life<br />3) High self discharge - so they are no good after a year on the shelf.<br /><br />I hope FTC or some other body takes a good look at this "stuff" and penalizes both the seller and the manufacturer.<br /><br />

Not the same as store brands!
I bought these thinking they are the same as the Sam's/Walmart store brand bulk pack. They are not. About half the batteries are bad out of the pack.<br /><br />They foreshadow their lack of quality control with an insert that says if any of these batteries are bad, please send them to ____ for a replacement. I really do not want to send a 20¢ (or any number of them) back for a replacement. I just want the battery to work.<br /><br />BTW, I have not check the expected life. As I am only putting them in electronics that get infrequent use (kid's pencil sharpener) or have minimal power demands (remote controls).

You Need a Battery Meter if You Buy This Bundle
This would be a good value if all the batteries in the bundle held a proper charge. Unfortunately, many of the batteries do not have a sufficient charge to be useful. In the package I bought, about 30 of the 100 had a full charge. The rest were below 50%. Also, a number of the batteries leaked, which is a potential cause of damage. Those batteries that had a full charge and did not leak performed well, but it is too much risk, in my opinion. Fortunately, no device I have received damage from these batteries, but I came close with a wireless keyboard where a couple of batteries leaked. I will not be purchasing another package of this brand again. Oddly enough, though, the AAA Ultralast batteries do not seem to have the leakage problem, but I still have about 3/4 package left. I will be keeping a watchful eye on them too.

ITEM DOES NOT WORK!
This item arrived Friday 6/12/09 and as soon as it arrived I tried it on my Inspiron 1505 and my son's 1501 and it did not charge either. I contacted these people on Friday and got one response that said they would gladly exchange or fully refund the product, but they need more information to make sure it wasn't a technical issue. I responded back and gave them all of the information they requested and here it is 2 days later and I have not gotten any response at all. At first I was willing to exchange, but now I don't want to deal with people that take your money and leave you hanging. I needed to get this issue resolved as soon as possible as my son is leaving out of town and will need to take our only working adapter. <br />So please beware if you buy this product it may not work and they will take their time responding to you!!!

Buyer Beware - This fried my laptop!!!!!  No help yet to Fix!!!!
Within seconds of using for the first time, it caused the Dell 1525 laptop to smoke and pop.  Technician said the adapter had wrong polarity.  The refund does not cover the damages...not by a long shot.  Everyone is pointing fingers so far.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY EVER!!!  My daughters brand new graduation gift is ruined.

Hazardous
Bought this 3 months ago. It fit loosely to the connector in the laptop. Now my screen is flickering and I can hear crackling noises coming from the adapter.

DANGEROUS
I totally understand the favorable reviews...I agreed when I first used two of these Dell laptop power adapters...they are almost identical to the power adpaters we got when we bought our Dell laptops (so, no--they're not lightweight or built for ultra heavy use nor do they span great distances...they're basically the same weight, size and length of the Dell adapters). But there's a reason they're $80 less than any other adapter--the product quality is awful. It's now been two months of moderate use. The first one died a month ago, and in a disturbing way...I plugged it into the wall and the cord that leads from the wall to the adapter actually shorted and started a fire. No lie...an actual fire. I blew it out right away, but after that I didn't trust the other one to be out of my sight while in use. But it worked, so I stuck with it. Then last night, I pulled the wall plug out and one of the two flat prongs stayed in my wall socket. Seriously? I didn't even notice it at first. Can you say electrocution hazard? I knew you could. Maybe these are rare cases of failed quality, but that's enough for me to say you're taking a chance probably not worth taking if you buy this product. All those who gave this product such a great review should provide a followup rating after six months of use--I'm guessing many of those 4-star and 5-star reviews would vanish.

Beware
I bought this charger for my inspiron 1501 after mine quit working and I couldn't afford a new one from Dell.  When I got this one, I was so excited because I wasn't able to use my computer for a few days and could finally use it.  The huge problem with this charger though is that it will not charge the battery!  It always says "plugged in, not charging," and when I restart my computer it says that the ac adapter is not compatible with this computer.  I never had this problem before with the original Dell charger.  All in all, I will probably be saving up to buy one from Dell, and while my computer works when it's plugged in, the whole purpose of a laptop is so that I don't have to have it tethered all the time.  If you do buy this, be advised, you may have the same problem.

You've Been Warned
Own a Dell 1520. Left my cord at my relative's house over Christmas and needed a new one. Didn't want to spend $75 on the Dell cord so ordered this. Worked fine for about a month. Charged the battery and the powered the laptop. Came home one day and laptop was dead despite being plugged in. Battery would not charge at all. Then, computer stopped recognizing battery altogether. Right now I'm using a cord I got from Radio Shack, but spent $200 on new battery and cord from Dell. I can't prove this cord did my battery in, but I believe it did. Dell's stuff is overpriced, but what can you do? Stay away from this cord and save yourself some headaches . . . and money.

Does NOT Charge!
I have an Inspiron 1501 laptop, and let me just say again clearly: this adapter does NOT charge my battery.<br /><br />I purchased it as a hopeful alternative to Dell's much pricier replacement adapter when my original one suffered an unfortunate death by puppy teeth. I was delighted to see it actually worked despite the negative reviews, but then I realized my battery was still at 0% an hour later. I plan to keep it - I'll be getting a new laptop soon so it won't be that much trouble to keep it plugged in - but this is definitely something I would not purchase again, or recommend to anyone else.

Stay away
Around September, I first purchased the charger. After about a month of use, the charger started to not work as well, it flickered on and off, and eventually it shorted out (which effectively shorted my battery life). The seller then contacted me to replace my charger, which I thought was great of them. However, a little more than a month into using this new charger, I am once again having issues with the charger flickering on and off. I assume it will only be a matter of time before it stops working all together. Stay away from this product! I realize it's cheap and therefore appealing, but I definitely recommend spending the extra cash to get the real charger from Dell- it's cheaper than replacing a ruined battery.

Don't buy it
I never write reviews for anything (this is the first one), but I feel it's necessary to warn potential buyers that this battery is worthless. I've had it for just over 3 months now and it has lost half of it's charging capacity. That's after only 44 charging cycles. I've let it run down and then charged it fully to try to restore the original capacity, to no avail. Another problem is that when it runs down to 20 minutes charge left it will erratically lose charge, usually shutting down my macbook without warning. I feel like this battery is not compatible with the 15" macbook pro. I just installed snow leopard last week, which has a battery detection feature. It's giving me the "Service Battery: The battery isn't functioning normally, and you may or may not notice a change in its behavior or the amount of charge it holds" message. Amazon should not allow this seller to sell these faulty batteries.

Shouldn't a battery charge?
My wife purchased this for me as a gift. I had it on my wish list, despite some negative reviews. I received the battery and it had about 93% charge. Though I suspect this wasn't quite accurate as it seemed to drain rather fast down to 85%. I was prepared for some inaccuracy. As far as I've read 3rd party batteries can have some conflicts with the accuracy of the percent shown. The battery seemed to hold up okay, I was doing a lot of video editing to run the battery down quickly so I could put a charge to it and properly cycle the battery.<br /><br />The Macbook Pro gave me the reserve power warning. Though at the 24 minute mark, vs the usual 9minutes on my old Apple battery. The computer still ran for at least 15 minutes before going to sleep due to low power. I plugged in the magsafe power adapter. "NOT CHARGING" says the indicator in my menu bar. The light on the power adapter is green, indicating a fully charged battery. I removed the charger and the computer went back to sleep, logically. Plugged it back in and still "NOT CHARGING" I reset the PRAM, the SMC. No effect. I put in my old battery and it will charge.<br /><br />After taking this battery out I noticed it was warped on the ends. Slightly more than a fit and finish issue if you ask me. I wonder if the battery was improperly handled or charged improperly at the factory.<br /><br />I am returning this item and will just fork out the dough for the Apple battery.

After 8 months of use, won't hold a charge
I bought this thinking there had to be a reasonable battery that was less than the apple replacement. I wish I'd just gone ahead and purchased the true replacement battery. After using this about 8 months, it won't hold a charge longer than a minute or two. It also runs very hot, too hot to touch. Seems like that can't be good for the computer. Not worth the bargain for this one.

Battery appears to have killed my PowerBook.
I'm an experienced Mac user, this is my 5th MacBook, and I'm a computer geek for a living, but this is a first. My old battery was nearly gone, but I seldom use this MacBook off power, so didn't want to spring for a new Apple battery. I've bought several 3rd party MacBook batteries before, most were at least acceptable.<br /><br />I flipped my Mac, put in the new battery, the Mac still told me the battery was missing. Odd, but maybe a shutdown/restart will do. Shut the Mac down, try to restart. Nothing. LED lights up, disk spins, but screen doesn't come on, and the machine doesn't boot (I can't see it on my network).<br /><br />Remove the new battery, put in the old battery, nope. The MacBook won't boot. Reset the SMC, still nothing. Disk is spinning, but the machine won't boot. Now, this could just be a wild coincidence, that my 4 year old MacBook, which has given me no problems, suddenly had an issue simultaneously with inserting a new battery, but that seems a bit far-fetched. <br /><br />Dropping the Mac off for service now, since I was unable to get it to boot. Looks like I'll be buying a Apple replacement as part of my service visit. So, this battery really ended up not being a bargain for me, I'm certainly not going to try putting it in my Mac again, after I get it back from service.

We thought we were getting a deal...
...I read the reviews of this product and was slightly concerned, but decided to go ahead and make the purchase. If there were an option for zero stars, I would choose that. I purchased the battery for my husband. It arrived partially charged (which is normally a good thing). My husband let it run down and attempted to give it a full charge and went through all the typical setup procedures to reset his charging system, but it didn't do a bit of good. The battery was also slightly warped. Needless to say, said product is currently on its way back to the seller and we are expecting a full refund. I do not recommend this particular battery. If you have a Mac, spend the full amount and buy directly from Apple. Giving 4 stars for Customer Service for shipping promptly and making the assumption that they will process our refund in a timely manner.

Don't buy this battery--it's a cheap knock-off with a fraudulent name
Do NOT buy this battery.  It is a fake and damaged my laptop.  It has all the markings of an Apple but it only looks like an Apple product.  It wouldn't fit flush, it scratched any furniture it went on, it did not hold a charge at all (even after multiple attempts, including several multi-hour overnight attempts).  This is an awful product that could damage your computer.  If you have it, get rid of it as soon as you can, at least remove it and put your old low-charge battery back in until you get a new 'authentic' Apple battery.  As one other reviewer mentioned his mother board fried/died.  I have heard one other person I know say the same.  When the battery was in my mac it actually started to burn my leg it runs so hot.  I have used the laptop "on my lap" for 2 years and never had this sensation before.  Also, like others have said, the charge indicator lights on the battery do not work correctly and give you no real indication of what the battery has done or its current status.  My laptop would turn off without notice, without warning.  I nearly lost several documents doing this.  I also can't imagine that could be good for the operating system of the computer.<br />When I took my laptop to the genius bar at an Apple store, the technician immediately noticed the off-color aluminum covering on the battery, including the fact that the battery didn't even sit flush in the computer.  The technician showed me the battery was one of the best Apple battery knock-offs/fakes he had seen so far, with the exception of the non-matching aluminum, a slightly different font, a missing hologram "recycle" sticker, an excess bar-code sticker (which apple does not place) and the fact the battery does not even fully fit my computer.  Because of the bad fit, the battery does not even make good contacts with the body of the PC and could be leading to unnecessary power surges and sudden power failure (which DID occur to me many times).  The technicians said there are several companies in China making unofficial, fraudulent Apple-branded products and making billions off of unsuspecting consumers.<br />Do not waste your money or harm your computer.  Send the battery back asking for a refund.  Consider buying an official Apple product from an official Apple retailer, with the slightly higher pricetag as "insurance" on your Apple investment.  I am not a big corporate fan.  I believe in cheaper pricing and competition but it is not worth sacrificing the products I DO have and the investing I have made thus far in my Apple products.  In this transaction I LOST $80 trying to save $40 for my battery--what did I gain--nothing, except a more cautious awareness of the wild west of internet marketing and sales, even through Amazon.  Amazon is just the conduit for mixing some of these fraudulent companies along with the good trustworthy vendors.  Only you can weed the bad ones out.<br />-fredandaniela

Didn't work with my D90 and didn't look like the advertised battery
Like several other folks that purchased this battery for their D90, it didn't work for me either. I am guessing that it is either the camera firmware that is preventing it from being recognized, or the battery is somehow different than advertised. The actual color of my arriving battery was plain grey, not gold like show in the product picture via Amazon.   Also please note that  these non-Nikon batteries don't have the little golden microchip that communicates with the Nikon camera on battery information.  Perhaps that is why it doesn't work on mine????  I am returning for a refund and sticking with Nikon branded batteries from now on.

Does not hold charge
This item works on my D80. When I received it, I had to do a full charge. Although after the full charge, the D80 did not show full charge, it did work. I took a few photos (about 10-12) on that day and kept the camera back. About a month later, today, I took the camera out and tried to switch it on - but it was dead. I had to switch to the original Nikon battery and only then it worked. <br /><br /> I want a reliable product and seems like there is not much worth in trying a replacement battery. I am going for the original. Luckily Amazon is taking it back for a full refund, and so it is going back. Great customer service from Amazon.

Simply doesn't work with my D90
Although it looks and feels not bad, it simply doesn't work with my D90.  So I'm returning it.  A little disappointed because the Opteka D90 grip got very good review.

Would not work in D90
Nikon's charger would show this battery as fully charged, but my D90 would show it as a dead battery. I have returned this battery and will be buying the OEM from Nikon. Don't waste your time with this 3rd party battery, go for the OEM. I received this as a gift, and Amazon was amazing in helping me return this item for a refund.

it's not working on my new D90
I bought this battery for my brand-new Nikon D90 because of these wonderful reviews.  To my disappointment, maybe just my bad luck, this battery was not recognized by my camera even after charging enough time.  I don't think my camera has a problem since I just bought it two days earlier and it works perfectly fine with the Nikon battery.  I'm going to give it another shot by asking for an exchange instead of refund.  For now, I can only give a one star to this battery, if the exchange works out, I will upgrade it in future.  I still have faith on this product  because of other people's experiences.  However people should be aware that it's possible that it may not work on your camera.<br /><br />Follow-up.  I tried to exchange, but since it was sold by the third party, amazon only offers refund.  Therefore I won't have a chance to re-evaluate it.  Case close!

Does not work with Nikon D90
I bought two of these Opteka EN-EL3e batteries, charged them up, and they both failed to work with my Nov 09 Nikon D90. Amazon should warn people about this battery's lack of comaptiblity with a new Nikon D90. Maybe the Opteka baterries were manufactured wrongly or has no quality control to check if thier batteries work in a D90 before it is shipped to the USA. Buy the original Nikon instead.

A total waste of money!!!!!
I bought this battery in November, charged it and put it in my camera bag. A week later (early December) I went to use it, and it showed that the battery needed charging. Strange, I thought, and re-charged it. Same scenario. I never even got to use the thing. It is worthless.

Don't waste your time
Save yourself some trouble and buy the real Nikon battery. The new EN-EL3e is an improved battery from it's predecessor. I purchased this Opteka for my D90 and it DID NOT recognize it. If I were you I would not risk it. It was cheap enough for me to try, but not worth the money or RISK of you do try it on your Nikon and something goes wrong so I am returning it to Amazon. From now on, I play no games an only buy Nikon original stuff. Amazon has a very good price on the Nikon branded battery. You pay for what you get, in this case I got nothing though ;-)

This battery cannot be charged for D90
After purchasing this spare replacement battery (Opteka EN-EL3e)for my D90, I found that it could not be charged by Nikon Charger.<br />When I asked Nikon custom service, they said D90 does not support 3rd party battery. I am still waiting for the firm reply from the vendor after 2 weeks time of purchase.  The reply from the vendor seems a little bit slow. May be I need to return it for refund later?

Not reliable
I have been using this product for 3 months. First couple days of use camera began to display low battery indicator earlier than expected. I installed another spare and continued. This went on a few times before I recieved a low battery indicator after fully charging it. I removed the battery and reinstalled and this went away. Now every time I use it and recieve a premature low battery indicator I just remove the battery and reinsert it and it clears. This hasn't hurt me yet but I know a disappointment will be lingering in the future when I miss a shot because of an invalid low battery indicator. Sometimes it happens after 5 shots sometimes after 50 but never has it actually been low. I suppose for some reason the contacts aren't making up completely. I am using original nikon batteries from now on.

Useless
Doesn't work for me at all.  After charging, I stuck it in my D90.  The camera went haywire.  It wouldn't recognize the battery and blinked on and off until I removed the thing.  Tried recharging it, but still doesn't work.  Buy cheap and weep.

Blurry, unusable pics
Before purchasing electronics, I usually research the product extensively.  My daughter needed a camera quick, so we purchased this camera and trusted the Nikon name.  My daughter (18 years old and taking photos her whole life) took about 250 photos.  I downloaded them to the computer and about 1/2 of them were blurry!    I thought it was "user error."  So many good pictures were unusable because of a focus isssue.  A multitude of excuses as to why she took such blurry pictures, so I took over.  I usually take pics with my Canon S5 IS (which I love).  I took a picture of a still subject while the camera was sitting on the table and it was still blurry!<br /><br />Bottom line- We returned the camera and will purchase something better.  I've read the other reviews and apparently this is not a problem in every L20.  It seems to be a quality control issue on the assembly line.

Even an inexpensive camera should take a clear picture!!
We bought this camera without any research, a friend had recommended Nikon, so we just trusted the brand and went for it.  We liked the price since we have three little ones who get their hands on things and tend to break them before they've run their life expectancy.  We knew we weren't getting a deluxe model, but assumed that we'd at least be able to take a decent, clear picture.  Nope.  Not on any setting.  And the time between shooting the picture and when the camera actually takes it is ridiculously long...its hard enough to get kids to look at the camera as it is...I can't tell you how many of our pics with this camera have been of my kids walking away from the shot (and to top it off, it's blurry!!).  Even the videos we've taken have been broken up and halted.  We'll probably go back to the Canon PowerShot!

blurry pictures
I just purchased this camera on the fly for my husband to take it on a business trip.  To check it out, I was playing with it a little bit and was unable to produce even one clear picture.  I thought it was me and tried different settings and more pictures.  I cannot make it work.  After checking here on Amazon, I see that this is a common problem with this camera.  It is going back to were I bought it, and I'll be looking for a different brand, something more reliable (this time after some extensive research).

Fuzzy Pictures
I really wanted to like this camera.  I thought the Nikon name would ensure a quality product.  I was wrong.  This Chinese made camera seems to have real quality control issues, especially around the area of picture focusing.  When I took pictures from one to eight foot distances, usually the pictures were superb.  However, my camera seems to have problems focusing at longer distances. If you read the reviews here, many people love the clarity of the pictures and a number of others find that the camera takes fuzzy pictures.  I think this is a quality control issue coming out of the factory.  Some of the cameras are manufactured properly, some are not.  I got one of the not manufactured properly cameras.  Some of the reviews here tell you how to take a good picture by doing this or that and that all the bad reviews are simply due to not reading the manual.  Not true.  If you get a bad one like I did, you can do any of the tricks mentioned but they won't fix a camera that has focusing issues.  Bad Nikon!

Loved it, Hate it ! DON'T BUMP IT. .
I am not a photo bug, but I know what I like in cameras. We actually own 3 assorted digital cameras, including my favorite, my Canon Rebel XT EOS. However, I wanted something for keeping on my body when out with my kids or to keep in my purse. The fact that the Nikon L20 took mini videos was a BIG bonus with me... I could leave my Blackberry in my pocket and get better little videos to email with the Nikon L20. And I could leave the Handycam in the house when not shooting major events. I found that I used the Nikon more outdoors than indoors since the shots were VERY slow indoors and photo quality dropped as natural light was replaced by our indoor light. I didn't care, it was a little camera for "casual" photos. Fast forward, first week of January 2010. I had the Nikon L20 in my hand, took a picture, left the camera on until it went to "sleep" waiting for my child to stop moving long enough for me to get a picture, pushed the button to take it out of "sleep" mode. The lens did not adjust and just took a really blurry/ fuzzy picture. I was puzzled and pushed the button again. The result was "LENS ERROR" in big red letters. Fast forward again, after getting the approval from Nikon to send the L20 back, the resounding and ridiculous email response amounted to they were NOT going to fix it and too bad. But I could pay them 106 dollars and change to fix it (more than what the camera is currently selling for). And no, they wouldn't send it back unless I paid them.  (I won't be having it fixed. I WORK FOR MY MONEY THANK YOU!) No longer is customer service part of what you are buying with a product. I didn't break it. However, from what I was told after the fact, it would NOT have taken more than a bump on the lens  or front of the camera without knowing to cause a multitude of "LENS ERRORS" on this camera. YEAH! Nikon got our money on this one, but never again. I am sure since SO MANY of these camera were sold "On Special" at various retailers during and after Christmas more and more reviews are going to show that this is a fatal flaw.

Can't make lemonade out of this lemon
I own a Nikon DSLR and with that in mind I turned to the Nikon name again when choosing a point and shoot to carry in my purse.  I bought this several months ago for $109.00.  I really should have sent it back but thought-perhaps it was a learning curve.  Not the case---over half of the pics where blurry-just not a good quality camera.  Certainly, not what i would expect out of Nikon.  Recently bought a  Canon P&S for my daughter and picture<br />quality is way better.  I will buy Canon for my next P & S camera. Save yourself the time and trouble-avoid this particular camera.

PIECE OF JUNK
Look out folks, this camera will not last more than a few months.  Bought it and within a few uses, the camera lens jammed.  contacted Nikon customer service, sent camera back with receipt, and their response was, "we'll fix the camera for $100".  Seriously?????  They were unwilling to do anything for us.  Given that the camera can be bought for around that price, obviously we did not pay them $100 to fix a defective camera.<br /><br />We bought a Sony instead, and have been VERY satisfied.  Will NEVER buy Nikon again!!!

Purchased two cameras - maybe got 100 pictures
Purchased a Coolpix L20 for my daughter in September of 09. I am not a camera professional by any means but knew that Nikon was 'supposed' to be good. In a sideline story, another person who lives with me had the same camera purchased for her 5 months earlier. <br />After my daughter had the camera for 2 months she came to me in tears because her screen was black with what appeared to be shattered glass. She had not dropped it or been rough with it in any way and was kept in a padded case. Then the other person, also afraid to mention it, said her camera had done the same thing after 3 months but her dad had not purchased the warranty so she did't say antying. Both of these young women have had cell phones and ipods that have lasted 2+ years. I had purchased the warranty for my daughters camera so I started pursuing that. I paid $129 for the camera, paid $24 to have it shipped correctly to Nikon only to be told the warranty did not cover the repairs. Nikon wanted $107 to repair the camera. I couldn't believe it. I asked to to have a supervisor call me and what I got was an email with pictures of the camera screen. That same week I saw the exact same camera, brand new, in a store for $79.00. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY NIKON AGAIN AND WILL ADVISE THE SAME TO OTHER PEOPLE. Nothing like having $350 'worth' of cameras that only lasted for 3 months. I want to add that buying a camera for me is not an spur of the moment purchase being a single mom with 4 kids and one income. Thank-you very much NIKON!

Beware - Not Backward Compatible
(NOTE: see my update on NeatWorks ver 5 below)<br /><br />I have been using NeatReceipts for a couple of years now.  I generally like the product, but I am now using BOTH the 'Classic ver 1.5.9" and the new Ver 4.0 software because NeatWorks broke a covenant with its' early adopters.  They broke two of the cardinal rules of product development (1) never, ever, under any circumstances forget your early customers and their data and (2) never remove vital features from the product.<br /><br />First, they "forgot" their "Classic ver 1.5.9" users.  Versions of the software from 2.0 up thru the current ver 4.1 cannot recognize or import any of the receipts or documents scanned into the earlier version.  I have personally talked to them about this for almost 2 years.  At first, in early 2007, they repeatedly stated that they were hard at work on a migration solution.  We depended on that statement, telling them how important it was for us to be able to access our archived data - for inventories, insurance and tax records.  <br /><br />But they finally just abandoned this effort and offered everyone a discount to upgrade to a later version.  How is that going to help with restoring archived data?  The data and file formats for their .elrec and .eldoc seem fairly simple - a scanned image and some recognized text fields.  Why can't they import those formats like they allow for jpeg and tiff images?<br /><br />They offered no acceptable reasons beyond that we are no longer working on that feature and "would you like to upgrade?".  They seem oblivious to the frustrations they have caused a large number of their early customers.  We even communicated with Rafi Spero, one of the companies owners.  If he couldn't make it happen, you know they don't care about you as a customer.  BEWARE THIS COMPANY.<br /><br />Secondly:  The "Classic" version allowed users to create folders and subfolders, etc.  This was a fantastic way to organize receipts for cash, various credit cards, checks and debits, by year and then by month.  Or to organize a copy of receipts for an inventory by broad categories and then further by store, year or vendor.  So the initial features of both subfolders and the ability to copy receipts from yearly tax records to inventory folders was extremely useful and helpful in elimnating paperwork clutter.<br /><br />The new ver 4 software does not support nested folders or copying receipts to other folders.  Every time you scan a receipt, it goes into a folder.  But all folders are on the same level.  You can show and hide folders, but this is an extremely clumsy process and causes users a lot of extra work in trying to organize their invoices and receipts.  If you want to copy a receipt, you have to scan it AGAIN.  How brain-dead is that?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This company has proven that, at their convenience, they will ignore or abandon prior versions of the software and remove vital features.  <br /><br />To fix some of their current short-coming, as mentioned above, it would not surprise me to see them create a new version of their software that is incompatible with what they are selling today.<br /><br />DO NOT TRUST them with any vital data that you may need in the future.<br /><br />UPDATE:  2-11-2010 - I have been given a preview of the new NeatWorks ver5 software.  I don't know when it will be released but it seems to have (finally) added back in some of the features that went missing with ver 2 and onward.  Now they also have a chance to allow for importing old receipts (".elrec" files) from their "Classic" users.  If they do Import ".elrec" files many Classic users will be happy that their data is no longer "orphaned".  I will then change my opinion and rating of NeatWorks and their products because they did admit to these past mistakes, listen and respond to their customers and "the true test of your character is how you respond to those mistakes."

Neat Receipts / Neat Works = Junk
There is no way of disabling the ANNOYING system notification process (Neat Works has finished processing yadda....)  IT"S 2008!!!!!<br /><br />Using the Neat Desk scanner:  You must hold/guide certain receipts, that are not the exact width of one of the feeder, to make sure it goes through straight, or it will scan at a crooked angle, and you cannot fix with the software.  (You can only rotate in 90 degree increments.)<br /><br />Which means you can forget scanning multiple receipts...  (which also means you get the annoying system notification message every time...)<br /><br />You cannot edit receipt images (especially cropping) once you have filed it.  (You must delete and re-scan.  Hopefully you kept the receipt...)<br /><br />Does not remember (or have) default sort orders.  You may set your receipts to sort by date (descending) and then by vendor, but if you split a transaction it goes away and you have to redefine it again.<br /><br />Cannot split transactions duing review & filing process.  Very problematic when scanning in multiple receipts as you have to note each one and where it is filed so you can go find and THEN split.<br /><br />Cannot enter negative amounts when splitting.  (required if you return/exchange something from 1 folder but purchased other things from other folders.)  You have to generate a 'fake' 0 amont split and then enter negative numbers in that one.<br /><br />BUT, you must be careful as there is NO way (NONE) to audit split receipts.  There is no view, report or anything to show all splits for 1 particular receipt to make sure totlas were correct.  (or even to audit sometime down the road.)<br /><br />When working with split transactions you will need an EXTERNAL calculator (or spreadsheet) to calculate amounts - especially tax amounts as the software does not provide a calculator - or ways of enetering the tax amounts (while splitting - you can afterwards - just not during...)<br /><br />All reports are designed for business purporses (all based on spending) and there are no reports for personal use - AND - there is no way to design or run reports other than the few that are built in.  No way to audit folders or receipts, etc.  For instance: a report showing all receipts by folder, or all recipts by date, etc.<br /><br />I cannot even run a report without the software locking up and having to use task manager to end app.  And then when I restart I LOSE ALL DATA FROM THE LAST TIME ENTERED. (Which just happened - and I lost 1.5 hours of work entering2 (yes TWO) receipts.<br /><br />And, of course, their website has no place for customer feedback... (at least publicly...)

Beware of upgrade issues
Beware... I used this product happily for years.. I recently upgraded the software -- after being assured by customer support that the upgrade would work with my version -- and have not been able to migrate over 10 years of receipts.  The company had the nerve to recommend I reinstall the last version -- print the receipts -- and scan them each in... I estimate that would take me about 60 hours of work.  so I'm stuck now -- and have lost a lot of data I spent hours scanning in... I would not trust this company to support you over the long run.  And of course, with tax records, that is vital.  Let the buyer beware....

Vista 32 incompatibility
I purchased the NeatReceipts scanner.  What a fantastic product I thought.  Until I tried to install it on my Vista 32-bit computer.  Impossible, even though it is supposed to be compatible.

it turned a mountain into the Himalaya's
I was in desperate need for a scanner to help with my receipts that had piled up for the past 12 months.  I purchased this scanner in the hopes that it would take a mountain and make it a mole hill.  Unfortunately, it turned a mountain into the Himalaya's.  The first 15 scans had 12 of them filed in the wrong colums.  Then, after moving them to the right spot, I had to manually fix 5 of them and fill in the blanks on 7.  I called up tech support and they just told me to continue to recalibrate, that the machine would eventually learn what I was scanning and to be patient with the software as it worked the bugs out.  While this may be the right answer, I expected the machine to come with somesort of pre-built education.  I thought it was my fault but there were no instructions in the box and no details on how to get started.    It is now in a box on its way back to the company as I am better off manually imputting the numbers into a xls spreadsheet.  <br /><br />

It's Going Back to Costco Tonight!
Neatco tech support keeps you on hold for longer than 10 minutes.  Their online support is worse - now my operating system is having issues. I've given up on your product. I've had to call twice regarding error messages when I attempt to open the software that came with the scanner.  Obviously, the 'out of box' experience hasn't been great for me.<br /><br />I bought the mini/travel scanner with carrying case from Costco for [...].  It was an impulse purchase that I thought would help me organize my receipts.  From the moment I loaded the software, it has been a hassle. <br /><br />I went to Neatco's website for suggestions.  After messing with my SQL Dumper, as the website instructs, my OS is now giving me error messages.<br /><br />I called Neatco's tech support two days ago.  "Jeff" told me he'd email my "simple soluton" to complete on my own.  I did.  Still no success.<br /><br />After having spent so many hours fighting with the software installation, I needed a break from it.  So I left it alone yesterday.  Today, I cleared everything out so I could start from scratch.  STILL NO LUCK!<br /><br />I am done!  Mitra

Don't waste your money
Neat has done a good job of packaging and marketing their products but poor product performance and lack of software support make them a poor choice for a scanner solution.<br /><br />The hardware is reasonably well designed but their software, specifically the capabilities and accuracy of their OCR is very weak.  Compounding the problem is a business model that requires you to keep buying new versions of their software, they do not release updates to fix the problems they call each fix a new release and require you to buy it.<br /><br />My recommendation is to look elsewhere or wait for version 10.0 (they are on 4.0 now) perhaps by then it will be a good product.

Please Do Not buy If you have Quickbooks
This scanner will NOT work with quickbooks and they do not give support for this item. If you wish to just scan into you PC then this is a good choice for a portable scanner. I should have listened to the other people who had already purchased this item.

Mine is going back -- what a peice of junk
The scanner can only scan a few items before it is necessary to disconnect and reconnect the USB.  It also makes the whole computer a bit unstable.  <br /><br />Even immediately after calibration, OCR is pretty worthless.<br /><br />During installation, it puts in an entire installation of SQL Server 2005 that is solely for its own use.  Even then, the data is not usable outside of its application.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this product is that the uninstall utility works properly.  Once removed, my computer works fine again.<br />

Frustrating
I bought an older version of this a year ago in the hopes of going paperless. I found the software to be really buggy, crashing a LOT (anytime I tried to scan more than a page). The scanning itself is slow and the automatic recognition feature is so time-consuming and then just plain wrong, it is practically useless. When they finally came out with a Mac version of the software I figured I'd switch it over from my PC to my Mac, and it doesn't crash as much, but I'm now trying to convert the old receipts to Mac as well and it's so painful and time-consuming...keeps crashing when I try to back up the old scans...have to download a new version of the software for the PC so that I can transfer the old scans...My husband bought the new software for his PC laptop and it was crashing his machine so much he gave up and uninstalled it...I've really just had it with this whole situation. I went ahead and bought a Snapscan and am so pleased with how quickly and efficiently that one works. Too bad to have wasted so much money and time on this annoying scanner.

Great Scanner, but Worst proprietary software ever!
I love this scanner, but I hate the software.  I have the latest version of the software version 4 SP3.  The help function is useless.  For example if you want to delete a folder you created, the help tells you to select the folder and then use a "delete" option that doesn't exist.  <br />- All I wanted to do was organize my scanned receipts and paperwork in folders I would create on my computer... VERY IMPORTANT to know that this software DOES NOT let you do that; but rather, requires that you use their proprietary records management system which is unfriendly, unintuitive, and non-responsive.  If there was a way to use this wonderful, easy to set up scanner without their stupid, frustrating, lying sack of crap software it would be great.  I'm still trying - but I'm getting the sinking feeling that I've WASTED MY MONEY.   Really too bad because it's a beautiful piece of equipment.... Also when you try to get help through their chat system during their advertised hours - there's nobody home.  Sincerely, John Graham

Bad Software!!!!!!!!!!!
Good Scanner with bad software! You can not adjust the image. It is preset to 300 dpi.When you scan it comes with gray background.When you save the document it takes 30 times more space that if you scan with PaperPort.When you scan more than one pages together it does not combine them.You have to do that manually. The export of the docs is very,very slow!It is not compatible with PaperPort!Very nice and cool design but that is the worst scanning software.

I called the next day and for (3) consecutive days and they have discontinued live tech support.  They said to e-mail which I did and coming on a week now, no response.  They want you to figure it out yourself on their very mediocre website.  I spent a couple hours to no avail.  I think I just have a faulty scanner, but cannot determine that with no technical support.  I have never heard of a company just deciding to cancel their tech support department.  I am assuming they are about to close their doors.<br />I am sending mine back asap.  Just wanted to get the word out.

Disappointing and slow
I just bought the desktop scanner a few days ago and am very disappointed with this machine. It's very slow to scan in color and it takes a while for the .pdf to process. The individual paper slots are very cool but only if you're scanning very few pieces of paper. <br /><br />So I'm back using ScanSnap which is far superior. (I thought for sure the Neat Scanner would be equally good or better.) If you're in the market for a scanner, I recommend buying ScanSnap especially if you're scanning  volumes and volumes of documents. It's more intuitive and easy to use.

Good Scanner, REALLY REALLY BAD SOFTWARE!
The hardware in this package is very good.  The scanner is fast and reliable.<br />The software is junk, and lacks support and consistency from the vendor.<br />A number of features from the older version were dropped, such as the ability to create sub folders.<br />Twice now, they have released new versions of the software which are not compatible with the old versions (latest version is 4.7.7 on their website which is incompatible with version 4.3).<br />In their support forum, they say that they will have an upgrade available from 4.3 when 5.0 comes out, but with their history of leaving their customers hanging out to dry, I'm less than optimistic about it.<br />Integration with quickbooks, which is why I bought the thing in the first place, is sparse.  It requires several steps and proofing along the way and is anything but elegant. <br />Also, there is no link between the record in quickbooks and the receipt.<br />The software may be adequate for home use, but it is completely inadequate for even a small business such as mine.

The proprietary software from NeatCo simply does not work with Windows 7. Their support forums have a number of people that are trying with mixed results.<br /><br />On January 19th, I opened a help desk ticket with NeatCo support. Support is available via email ONLY. After duplicating my error over the course of several days, it has now been ten days with no response, and 15 days since I opened the original ticket.<br /><br />There is a much better way: Get the fujitsu SnapScan and [...]'s software.<br /><br />NeatCo uses a proprietary SQL engine, proprietary database format, and proprietary software. They will essentially hold your data hostage. Not good. Evernote works with more platforms and is simply a better solution.<br /><br />Unless they fix this, I strongly recommend you take a look at the Fujitsu/Evernote combo.<br /><br />Update 2/9/10: I opened a ticket with them on 1/19 with their Tech "Matt Toth". Duplicated the error over the course of six days. Since everything goes via email, and each email is a "new" six hour response, only one troubleshooting step is completed each day. Miserable.<br /><br />Then, after duplicating the error, I have not heard from them at ALL since the 25th of January. I have sent several emails asking for a status update, and reminding them how long this has been open. NO response for 15 days, and the ticket has been opened for 21 days.

If you have Vista, I do NOT recommend getting this scanner!
I've been using a Canon CanoScan N650U since about Sept/Oct of 2000 for all of my scanning and it's always performed beautifully: however, in it's old age and in preparation for going to that great scanner heaven in the sky it's started leaving a faded stripe down all the images that I scan, from color photos to black and white sketches...it was time for a new scanner.<br /><br />I researched the Canon 8800F quite a bit and had my mind set on it when I went to buy a new scanner at B&H Photo in Manhattan, but I changed my mind while talking to the sales person.  He said that the HP G4050 and the 8800F were comparable (the HP being about $40 cheaper) - and both boxes claimed to be Vista Certified.  The reason that I went with the G4050 came down to one thing: it can scan 4x5 transparencies (negatives) which is extremely important to me as I photograph with a 4x5 view camera.  Also, due to the fact that it has a larger transparency/negative scanning area you can scan roughly twice the amount of slides or 35mm negatives at a time as you can with the 8800F.  I took my new scanner in hand and hopped on the A train as I headed back to Brooklyn, anxious to finally scan some old negatives that I'd never even had a chance to print...but I never got that chance.  <br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the G4050 is a very large scanner - long, wide, thick.  That really didn't bother me even though I'm used to the very slim profile of my CanoScan N650U, but what did bother me immediately was this...<br /><br />When I opened up the instructions to get the scanner set to go, there was this discouraging note on an insert that had been printed in 9 languages - it read: "The HP Photosmart Software for HP Scanjet Scanners Windows Vista CD supports Windows Vista.  With Windows Vista, some features may not be available."  So, I just bought a brand new scanner, whose box claims to be Vista Certified, and now there's a note basically explaining that actually, not everything's going to work.  Like buying a new car and finding out that oh, the steering wheel doesn't quite work.  <br /><br />I downloaded the software anyway, wanting desperately to be one of the people who say "there are a lot of negative reviews, but this sucker is beautiful!" but my chance did not come.  All the software did was produce errors and have Vista try to find "a solution" online: it found nothing.  I had had my fill of the G4050.  I'm sure that if I had downloaded this and that, and called 27 different HP customer service reps that it would have finally "worked" but it's just not worth the effort.  I love HP printers, but this HP scanner is back at B&H.  And my brand new Canon 8800F is on the way.  <br />

Did not work for me
Very cool concept, so I bought it regardless of bad reviews -- maybe I would be one of the lucky ones.  I am a very experienced computer user and engineer, and have always been able to get things to work.  The scanner is mechanically impressive and I really liked the six color idea.  But it just didn't work.  Software installation took a long time on my XP machine, and, as written in other reviews, things take a very long time and use lots and lots of system resources.  I got a very nice scan of an 8x10 print, but I could not get slide scans to work with digital ICE; the software crashed consistently.  I am known for my patience, but it quickly became clear that this product was released before it was ready.  I almost never return tech products, but this one went back to be replaced by an Epson photo scanner in the same general price/feature range, which is working fine.  Now I am finding it very hard to get the HP software to even uninstall.

HP Disappointment
Color of scans was too saturated and unrealistic when compared with comparable scans and original slides. Software is quite user unfriendly. Scan speed unacceptably slow for adequate resolution of medium format positives. Did not live up to specifications and fell far short of expectations, so it was returned immediately. I am very disappointed in this product and it does not seem to live up to usual HP standards.

WARNING!
This scanner is NOT compatible with the current Macintosh operating system - OS 10.6.<br /><br />HP insisted a new driver would be available in October, but nothing has been released as of 20 November.

Mac 10.6 Snow Leopard
After talking with HP to see if this product works with 10.6 they informed me that YES, it would. I purchased this scanner and had it overnighted to me to find out that it will NOT work with 10.6. ALL documentation states that it will even this site but don't be fooled. Do MAJOR research before dumping money into something that will not work for you. I've been waiting 3 months for the software to be released that was to be released late October. No one at HP can tell me anything on the release date other than 2 more weeks.

Does NOT work with Windows 7 as of Jan 1, 2010
Hp has failed to provide Windows 7 drivers for the G4050 Scanner as of the beginning of 2010.  This would be sort of bad if the G4050 was an older product not found on stores shelves, but it is HP's current model being sold at my local Staples today!<br /><br />Also, the other issue I had with it, when I was still using Vista, was the area on the scanner where the scanner glass meets the plastic bevel.  It isn't flat. The plastic is a good 1/8 of an inch higher than the glass.  So when I scan a book page with a large photo that comes close to the edge, the plastic bevel lifts the rest of the book page off the glass, causing a noticeable shadow and distortion in the scan.<br /><br />If the surface was completely flat, then the book page would lay flat.<br /><br />Included software seems dated. Like shareware from 1997.<br /><br />Good Luck!!

Neat Receipts for Mac Stinks
Neat Receipts is a great idea and concept.  But the moment you start to really use it disappointment will set in.  <br /><br />The portable scanner works fine.  You have to feed the receipt in with a loving delicate touch.  I can live with this.  Here is the problem.  Initially when you do not have much in the library, you can scan and process receipts as fast as you can feed them.  Great.  BUT, once your library starts to build up, it can take up to two minutes for the program to open and I average about one receipt scan per 1.5 minutes.  No kidding.<br /><br />When you read the Neat Receipts' response to the army of pissed off Mac users they simply acknowledge it doesn't work well when you get more than 900 items scanned and it is our responsibility to not have more than 900 items in our library.  Come on Neat Receipts.  Any average consumer or average business person makes more than 900 purchases in a year.  They expect you to split off your library and create a multitude of sessions.  This is a lame diversion from their software engineers fixing the problem.<br /><br />So, what is their solution, just like the PC vs. Mac ads where PC spends more money on promoting/advertising the product instead of fixing it in R&D.<br /><br />Mac users, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Stay away from this sinkhole of a money pit.<br /><br />I am now looking at Mariner's Paperless software.  Their features and compatible scanners are listed below.  Most scanners are already compatible with this software.<br /><br />[...]

NetRecieipts for Mac
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CQDOMM">NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System for Mac (White)</a><br />Was not satisfied with this product.  I had very high expectations for it.  I had to return it a day after I received it.<br /><br />Cons- <br />-Too slow.  It took way too long to scan a 8x10 receipt (2min) and about a minute for a Standard receipt<br />-Did not sort my items or information correctly<br />-Did not capture all of the necessary information, like Merchant's Name<br /><br />Pros-<br />-Great packaging<br />-Small and compact<br />-Makes a PDF of paper receipt and can directly import digital receipts from online purchases<br /><br />Overview-<br />If you do not have a lot of receipts to record and you have lots of time to wait..  This is for you.  If you are part of the busy fast paced world with 10 things happening at once, you are better off manually entering your receipts in Quickbooks or other database..

Doesn't read business cards accurately
I purchased neat receipts for the sole purpose of scanning business cards.  I used to use card scan with a PC years ago and it saved me a lot of time manually entering data.  I thought neat receipts would do the same thing. I considered card scan for mac but could not justify paying almost $100 more.  Well, neat receipts just is not the ticket.  It makes so many mistakes in the OCR process that I spend an equal amount of time correcting them as I would if I just entered the data manually.

Never Worked - Neat did NOT Respond!
I really wanted to love this product. I have been seeing the ads in magazines for a while - the little white machine with orange advertising. I was sold. I finally ordered it one day and followed the instructions. Calibrated and then ran a test scan with a form I needed to scan. All I got was weird spots. Tried to calibrate and trouble shoot. <br />But gave up. I am a Mac user and I am used to being able to troubleshoot things after 2-3 tries. <br /><br />I emailed customer support and I got no response. <br /><br />Was really hoping for it to be awesome. <br />I have to say I am really sad. <br />Worst - I don't even want to bother putting it back in the box and returning it to Amazon. <br /><br />Am I alone?

Not so Neat....
I purchased my Neat Receipts for Mac on July 2009.  A few weeks ago it stopped working completely, but it is still under warranty.  The support service of The Neat Company only contacts customers via a message board on their Website, which is slow moving.  When I finally got my replacement scanner it looked used.  I called the sales division after writing several messages that went unanswered.  The sales rep said that they only replace scanners under warranty with refurbished ones, and that it is stated in their warranty disclaimer.  I read it and there was nothing of the sort.  So I requested they send me a new one...still waiting after a week for that...<br /><br />I DO NOT recommend that you buy this product, the software is also VERY slow.  The other scanner recommended in these reviews is better.

NO SUPPORT AND DOES NOT SCAN
So I get this little scanner and I am so excited about it.  I follow the directions, install the software and go to scan... Nothing.  I try a black and white receipt from Wendy's - it picks up a few spots.  I try a receipt from getting gas yesterday.  Streaks.  I try to scan a business card from a woman I sat next to on my last flight - streaks.  I try it in color.  Still streaks.  <br /><br />Then I try to call support.  I get a phone hell saying there is no live customer support.  I sent a message, like that is going to do any good.  I called sales and got a lady named Giulia who claims to be the "director of sales" but has no idea how to help a customer.  I tell her it doesn't work.  She tells me to send an email.  I tell her that I will return it rather than send an email because I need to talk to a person.  She says (again) we don't have live support.  I ask her who will answer the email.  She says technical support.  I ask to talk to them.  She says they do not have incoming phones (which is BS - what if one of the support techs' kids get sick or hurt at school?).  I tell her that I will give her my number and they can call me back.She says (again) that they have no live support.  I then tell her that I need to return this brick as it does not work.  She asks me who I bought it from.  I told her that I bought it from them..... this goes on and on.  <br /><br />Needless to say, it is now my mission in life to assure that nobody I know, personally or professionally, ever buys anything from this company unless they want a piece of junk that does not work and for which there is no support.  If people want to throw their money away, buying this product is one sure way to do do so, based on my experience.   This might be the best little scanner in the world but since I cannot get support, and I have followed their directions and it does not work, I guess I will never know.

Innovative Technology 35mm Negative and Slide Converter to PC
Do NOT waste your money!  I bought it to view and save 35mm negatives to CD disks.  The colors are not true and there are many small white dots on the images.  Called their 800 number for tech support and e-mailed them, too.  No response either way.  I don't know if the converter is junk or the software.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
You get what you pay for!
I would not recommend anyone buying this 35mm Negative and Slide Converter. I could not get it to work on either of my two computers. The software would not load with Windows or Vista. When I tried to get help from Technical Service their web page and telephone was no longer in service. I could not find any address to return it. I gave up and bought a HP Scanjet G4050 which worked perfectly scanning over 1,000 35mm Slides. My experience was a learning one. You get what you pay for!

Slow, don't buy it.
I bought this Innovative Technology to save money. "You get what you pay for" was never truer.<br /><br /> The first review was 5 stars and evidently the father was a senior like me so I thought. Ok. I just think the the father was too kind to tell his child this is a piece of junk.<br /><br />Do like the other review said and buy another one.<br /><br />It is so slow. I did not think any techie thing today could be that slow. It is slow to respond to any click of the mouse for anything. Each slide takes more than a minute to do, probably 1.5 minutes and it is very frustrating. Almost anyone who has slide has hundreds or thousands of them and this is not the device to purchase.<br /><br />I'm sending it back.

Terrible image quality
I had no problems installing the drivers, that worked fine. My problem is with the image quality. It's downright terrible. The colors are nowhere near correct, and the gamma is off such that each image comes out extremely bright and washed out.  EVERY image needs editing. The scanner only returns JPEG images, and they're super compressed and full of artifacts. It works nicely, but who cares about that when the image quality is sub par. If you just want images you can share via facebook, it's more than adequate for that. But if you want archival quality scans that you can make prints from in the future, don't waste your money.

incompaitible with 35MM and Vista OS.
The driver for this item is NOT compatible with Windows Vista.  The slide trays are of a size too large to fit the holes in my 35MM negative films.  The picture openings are too large for the 35mm photo negative films.  Attempted two different Innovative Technology slide converters <br />neither driver would install in my Vista OS computer.  I don't believe these IT converters are<br />made for 35MM negatives.

Color reproduction of 35mm slides is poor.
I received the device for Christmas because members of my family knew I wanted to convert my 35mm slides into digital.I had over 2K slides to convert. The device uses white LEDs and thses overdrive the color. There is no true color correction circuit, or LED brightness control. Blue skys are sometimes given an "extra sun" a bright smear effect, at times people's faces become washed out--extra bright in this case.There's more that's not good. The device does allow you to save your pictures in a folder--when it doesn't hang up on you that is. In that case you'll need to reboot the pc and redo the 12 pictures--again. It processes 12 at a time. After the 12th picture you must save the "strip of 12". Using software such as Elements or whatever to correct the picture color, etc... after they are processed by this device is a hit-or miss job depending upon how bad the device converted the picture. In most cases you are not close to the colors of the original slide. To give you an idea how bad this device does the processing take your slide before conversion and compare it to what was processed. You may not like the results unless you like color pictures that look like they aged 200 years. Good luck. (My OS is WinXP Pro SP3)

lack of support
After 4 phone calls and 3 e-mails I have not heard from the technical people to help make this unit work.<br />I have not given up on the scanner yet, but I am highly disapointed at the lack of support.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Bad image quality
I was able to easily set up this device and software. However there was way too much contrast in the scanned images (beyond what could be addressed even in photoshop), and no control for the brightness or contrast on the unit. The device did not live up to its promise.

I want my slides
I have a 2 phase complaint.  <br />1. The instructions and manual say to calibrate the slide scanner before first use.  When I perform this step, Windows XP restarts.  So I cannot really rate the product because it will not load.  The customer support (e-mail only) ARCSOFT Said the problem is the Scanner Driver they cannot help with hardware. There is No support available from ION manufacture listed.<br /><br />2. I received the scanner from the seller (GIZMOS FOR LIFE) on 12/23/08<br />Tried to use it that day and it failed. Reported the problem that day 12/23/08 and got a automated email reply that response would be 1 to 3 buisnes days.  According to the return policy listed here on Amazon.com<br />the Seller (GISMOS FOR LIFE) the buyer has to pay for shipping to return<br />a faulty item. THIS IS WRONG just Wrong.  If the item is defective the buyer should not have to pay to return it.  I will revise my review if and when I hear from the seller (GISMOS FOR LIFE).  PS I have bought a lot of items from Amazon.com and have never had a problem before.<br />

"30 IMAGES PER MINUTE" MISLEADING
I purchased the Ion Slides 2 Pc to digitize a large family collection of slides from over the years. For its small cost, I thought I could save a lot by doing it myself and not sending it to a lab to do it professionally. Once you install the software (scanner driver, and Photo Impression 6), you reboot and then start up Impression 6. Click on "get Photos" and the quick scanner calibration starts. Now its time to scan. The program gives a live view what the scanner sees so you can align everything up(the trays click into place for each slide, but it is just to make sure everything is aligned), and then you can take a "snapshot" (using the button scanner, or the button on the program) of the slide, and continue onto the next one. Unfortunately, the scanner can only store 12 slide snapshots in its memory before it has to transfer them to the computer. When you copy over to the computer, the transfer rates are VERY slow. About 1 and a half minutes per each snapshot. The labeled "30 images per minute" is pure crap. If you can do up to 12, and then have to transfer, how could that be under a minute? On top of that, the file sizes were only 300kb(using normal quality). What took so long? I believe that you may as well just get a flatbed scanner with the slide attachment for it, because they both will take the same time and have the need for the flimsy slide/negative tray. Unless this product can be used with the driver and another program, I think it is a complete waste. The system it was running off of had:<br />RAM: 2.00 GB<br />CPU: Dual Core 1.7 GHz <br />Windows Vista Home Premium

Fun little scanner ruined by bad customer service.
It has the potential to be a useful, though not professional quality scanner. The big downfall is support from Ion I tried 5 times to get an email response from them to no avail. I've called them twice and was told there would be a 20 minute wait. After twenty minutes I was switched to another line and told there would be another 20 minute wait. I would not recommend this or any other Ion products because of the total lack of regard they have for their customers.

Won't Work With other Scanners
Despite the negative reviews below I thought I'd give it a try since it has a nice price and I have lots of slides to digitize. Too bad, it doesn't work on my Dell XPS XP system. Unfortunately, the Ion Slide 2PC depends on the old TWAIN scanner drivers.  Since it is a camera why couldn't they connect as a camera instead of a flaky, slow scanner? Although it installs easily I found that I cannot calibrate it on my Dell XPS XP system even though I tried to cleanse my system of any other TWAIN remnants.  Also, their support does not exist. Weeks have gone by and I can't get a response.  I did install it on my sons old XP system and it did work!  No scanners.  However, it is limited in RAM and the Slide 2 PC is really, really slow there.  Don't bother to buy this if you ever had a scanner on your system.

Ion slide converter not up to par
I got the highly recommended Ion slide converter for Christmas.   I have used it to convert several slides to digital.. well there is no adjustment for the automatic white level.  pics look good if you have no projector to see them.. but they are really washed out images because they are to intense.  the detail is washed away..  if I could turn down the auto white level I could have a resonable output.    I sent an email to the company to ask if there was anyway to adjust and no reponse after three weeks..  software does not help since the image comes into the computer that way.. no way to fix it.  just lighten and darken the no detail pic.<br /><br />In almost every case the image I took with my digital camera of the slide projected on a white board is better than the ION.<br /><br />I have not tried the negative converter yet.  hopefully that will be better than scanning the picture.. but so far picture scans are very good with my HP scanner.

Multiple people have had installation problems!
Multiple attempts to install on Win XP without success. Scanner causes a 'runtime' error when used with PhotoImage 6 (supplied with scanner). Scanner will work with other software (e.g. Photoshop), but doing so makes coloring correcting scanned negatives a major headached. The ArcSoft forum has multiple entries regarding the 'runtime' error problem with PhotoImage 6 and have failed to address them over the last several weeks.<br />A definite 'DO NOT RECOMMEND' on this product.

Do not waste your time or money on this product
This product would be better classified as a toy, instead of being described as a device to help customers convert usable slides to quality digital formats.  I had no problem with setup or using the device, just the quality of the digital format was so poor, it was useless.<br /><br />Then I returned it, paying the shipping, and was refunded only 85% of the purchase price, totalling $22.59 out of pocket costs.

Absolute garbage
This product comes with out of date software. My computer could not recognize the product after it was connected even after using multiple USB ports and reinstalling the software 3 times. Product support informed me that the software that came with the product was out of date and that an upgrade was available online, but that required a lot of detailed steps. After each step you needed to check if the product now worked and if it didn't you went on to the next step. I gave up after step 4 and sent the product back.

unit really does not even deserve one star.  the resolution of scanned image is not even worthy of $25.00 let alone the asking price.  Image is never in focus once scanned and is not correctable even in Photoshop.  I have wasted my money and warn everyone to not purchase this product.

Software Drivers Truly Terrible
I have an extensive I.T. background, working helpdesk and tech support for various organizations over the last 5 years. I have installed and uninstalled hundreds of printers, mostly because it is usually so easy to do. In fact, I've *always* recommended HP products to all my clients because they are so simple, reliable, and essentially ubiquitous. <p>Not so for this printer! I have spent, and this is no exaggeration, the better part of 5 work days on the phone with tech support *just trying to install the printer*. Whereas some people can install with no problem, when there is a problem, it is catastrophic. Installation issues include:<p> * Having to install the drivers (all 450 MB of them) multiple times; according to their support site, HP tells you some machines require multiple installations before they work. WHAT?<p> * An installation program that crashes with no error or warning. Suddenly, it's just gone, and nothing's actually been installed. Or, of course, there's my favorite: An error message that's simply a blank pop up window. Pretty tough to address that one.<p> * An uninstall procedure that's 4-steps deep. That's right--you have to run their uninstaller FOUR TIMES, and each iteration takes longer than the last. Be prepared, if you call tech support, to uninstall OVER AND OVER AGAIN, and repeat the same process OVER AND OVER AGAIN.<p>When you call a tech support line and their first idea to address why the install program doesn't work is to update the drivers for your USB ports on a machine that's only 6 months old, they're fishing for answers, but nothing's biting. AVOID THIS PRINTER AT ALL COSTS! Sure it's cheap, but that's because it doesn't work very well!!!!!!

Substandard product
Cons<br />The color ink cartridge dries up and stops working if you don't use it for a few days. I would print in b&w for a few days, then go to print a color page and the colors would be blurry and streak. Happened with multiple cartridges.<br /><br />The software is enormous in size, cumbersome, buggy, and not particularly useful. <br /><br />After using my previous HP printer for years (25,000 pages printed), this one is a hunk of junk with in 3 months. It looks like HP's quality has declined. Bought a Canon, which has been flawless so far, both in software and the scanning and printing.<br /><br />Pros<br />Black and white print jobs work and are very fast. <br />Scanner scans.<br />Fairly compact for an all-in-one.

terrible printer!
Absolutely horrible!! After installing and unistalling several times, I finally took it back to the store. Brought new one home..after two more times installing and reinstalling, got it working or so I thought. Prints when it wants to, not real good photo print quality, ok text documents. The software that comes with the printer sounds like a nice idea but more than half the time the pictures stop downloading (even with very  small sizes and quantity) I will never purchase from hp again

HP blew it on this one
After our HP multi-function printer was damaged in a lightning storm we purchased this cheaper version. What a mistake! After finally getting the software to load, when the paper isn't jammed, it shakes and sputters until it finally spits out a damp feeling print. I guess you get what you pay for. We never had any trouble with the old model.

Install problem - System cannot find the file specified
I just purchased a PSC1350 all in one. When I try to install the minimum driver software using their wizard, it bounces up an error code that says &quot;System cannot find the file specified&quot; in trying to pull a file. Looking at the CD, it is clear that the program .exe *is* missing.(d:\Setup\hpzwis01.exe -l ENU -f c:\windows\hpoins03.dat -Validate No -w 329562)<p>What kind of internal screwup would it take to have a printer missing a fundamental part of the install wizard? <p>Even more amusing is the response from HP when I called to complain - &quot;Oh, yes, something must have been forgotten on your CD&quot; like it was some kind of personal packing job, CD by CD. They must print thousands of these at once. <p>When I asked whether there were others that had the same problem, they blithely said, &quot;Yes, but it is easy to download from the web.&quot; Upon going there, and currently still downloading the *50* MB drivers, which is better than the 450MB(!!) regular install. Crazy! Good thing I don't connect by modem...

Not worth the cardboard box it came in
First, I am a HUGE HP fan. I love their printers and have had 8 over the last 14 years and  still have four of them all over the house. I have used and loved HP Laser and Inkjet printers since the early 90s. So I really looked forward to using their scanner and photo feeder because my family of 6 has many thousands of 3.5 x 5 and 4 x 6 photos we want to scan and save to DVD. This was to be THE answer. Boy, was I wrong. Well, HP was wrong, I was just gullible.<br /><br />This scanner jammed on every picture fed into it if you were not standing there to make sure that when it was shot out, it dropped flat. Then it failed to correctly crop all but one photo in each batch. <br /><br />This scanner should have been dumped in a trashcan the first day I bought it but it was the only game in town so I after a call to HP Customer Service, I waited for a YEAR for HP to come out with the promised 2.0 software so that it would correctly crop the photos.. Version 1 would correctly crop ONE out of 24. The LONG awaited Version 2.0 would correctly crop the first and the last one of 24. Version 2 did almost nothing to make this any more an AUTOMATIC photo feed scanner than it was before. What is the point if you have to feed each one by hand and then re crop and rename them all???<br /><br />I finally got rid of this doorstop and yesterday I went out and bought the new Epson Perfection 2480 Limited Edition! For any of you that want a scanner that actually scans AND crops the pictures correctly; IT WORKS PERFECTLY!<br /><br />Within ten minutes of opening the box, I placed a stack of 16 3.5 x 5 for the first batch and then a stack of 24 4 x 6 into the hopper and gave it a file name (HP does NOT do this part) and it scanned them all, PERFECTLY CROPPED, named them with the name I gave then and then appended the correct 001, 002, etc after! It also remembered the last number so the next batch would just start numbers where you left off.<br /><br />The Epson software interface is a bit clunky (no worse than HPs poor interface) but the scanner does it's job flawlessly! It scanned all the pictures with absolutely no help from me and it cropped them all perfectly and named them perfectly! The ONLY thing left for me to do was to turn the landscape ones right side up (using Vallen Jpegger, of course, to avoid any loss)!!<br /><br />I am in heaven! I will truly be able to scan those thousands of family photos, UNATTENDED.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a scanner to scan a LOT of snapshots and you do not want to have to do hours of work to fix them, do NOT buy the HP Auto Photo feeder models.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

Cool Idea - Not ready for prime time
I purchased the 5500c solely for the photo feeder capabilities.  The driver and related software is terrible and would not work at all under XP.  The web-based tech support fix was very destructive (find all files with -twain- in them and delete! - please!)<p>Next I installed on a win 98se machine and the software worked better but the APF repeatedly reported jams after feeding one photo and often would not feed any photos at all.  <p>I am a very tech saavy and experienced scanner user with transparency, photo and document scanners and had a terrible time with this one.  I hoped to scan a large number of photos efficiently and have had an HP 6350cse with a document feeder that has worked great for years and an HP Digital Sender that I bought for my ofice that is also great, but the document expertise does not appear to have translated well to this innovative attempt at photo feeding.  Sadly I will be taking this back tomorrow and doing lots of scans on my Epson 2450 instead.

Scanner doesn't work even with Tech Support
I purchased this scanner because I needed something for negatives and photos, my husband needed something for documents. The negative scanner works ok as long as you do it from the scanner software and not editing software like photoshop or paint shop. The photo auto feeder has never worked. I spent 2 and 1/2 hours on &quot;live support&quot; from them and was bounced through 3 &quot;agents&quot;. (I got one of them twice) Not only could they not solve the problem they infromed me, after I told them that I was tired of waiting for them to &quot;review the notes&quot;, that my best option was to contact them the next day. Then different people would be there. <p>I wouldn't ever recommend this scanner or this company to anybody.

Please do not purchase this product
I purchased this scanner on March 14th 2005.  The feeder did not work from day one.  After contacting HP Customer Support I was told that I would need to replace the feeder for an additional $129.00!<br /><br />Please do not throw your money away on this scanner.

Don't waste your time
I purchased this so I could save time. I needed to scan in about 50 photos for a project.  I often do these type of projects and I often find myself spending alot of time feeding flatbed scanners.  So the idea of the APF was very appealing to me.  Unfortunately, the product does not deliver. The first unit I brought home had problems with an "unexpected internal error" message. It would simply freeze on about every other photo (I'm running Windows XP on a Dell P4 2.4 GHz, with 512 Megs of RAM).  The website had this error all spelled out with four ways to fix it ... none of which worked.  I called support and told them all that I did.  They sent me an email with the same four items to try.<br>So back to the store I went and they gave me another unit to try.  This one did not lock up, but it would barely feed the photos.  It successfully fed photos about 50% of the time.  These were 4x6 photos that were in perfect shape.  Similar photos fed easily in the previous unit.  Beware that feeding a photo through more than five times was not recommended by HP.  This is because of the accumlative damage that the feeder imparts on the print. So after many hours of trying to save time, I took the second unit back for a refund and now I'm back to manually scanning. Yes it is slow, but at least it's steady progress.

A Frustrating Waste of Money
This product has terrible drivers that constantly malfunction. The one big feature of this scanner- the automatic photo feeder, never works. It just tries to pull a picture in but fails (no matter how many you put in the feeder, what size they are, how far you stuff them in), then scans a blank page, saves it, and continues to do this over and over indefinitely until you either run out of hard drive space or remove the pictures from the feeder. In the rare event it tries to suck anything through, it either scratches up the print, or else tries to suck through ten prints at once and gets jammed and mangles them. In the extremely rare event that I ever get it to scan a picture, there's no auto cropping for the sheet feeder, so every picture has a lot of scanner-background that has to be manually cropped out of every image. HP has great auto-cropping software that comes with their OfficeJet line of scanners, but they don't have it for their sheet feed scanners, where it really matters. <br /><br />Additionally, while it comes with a slide and negative adapter, the dynamic range is pitiful- this scanner can't even get saturated blacks off a print- so the slide and negative scanning is near worthless. <br /><br />Please save your money and buy something else- this product is terrible.

useless ADF
I bought the scanner specifically to use its ADF, since I have many 3x5.5 and 4x6 photos I'd like to bulk scan. The scanner does not offer either page size, but instead offers many other sizes like A6 and &quot;Japanese Postcard&quot; and a few other odd sizes. Picking any of the offered sizes, I get pictures that scan wrong, coming out too long. Although I can scale the pictures aferwords in Photoshop, it's a step that should not be necessary and results in reduced imaze quality from the resizing.<p>I've also noted that the HP software will scan directly into a progam, but not directly to a file. Since I want to put in a stack of pictures, scan them to files, then put in the next stack, and keep at it for a large number of pictures, I find it a waste of time to have to wait for the pictures to load into the HP Director or Photoshop or some other program only to have to manually close them all before continuing with the next stack of pictures.<p>I've made sure that I have the latest drivers and have spend several hours on a few occassions trying to make it work. I'm about ready to give up on it. Since I bought the scanner specifically to use the ADF and the ADF won't work correctly, the scanner is useless to me.

Good idea... too bad it doesn't work.
Purchased for the APF, I thought this scanner would revolutionize my work flow.  Little did I know that it would not only NOT revolutionize anything, but it would crash my computer, take hours of installing &amp; unistalling &amp; reinstalling &amp; reuninstalling (you get the picture) both the software and the scanner itself.  Then, I had to unplug every other non-vital thing from my computer because of a &quot;conflict error&quot;.  So, I contacted HP online support only to have them tell me that they needed to &quot;research this particular issue&quot; about 15 times before I gave up.  What a waste of time.<p>So, now, I've got a deadline to meet, a scanner that is useless, a computer that's frozen up more times than Lake Erie, and few remaining hairs to pull out.  <p>From all of the reading I've done, it seems that at least 50% of the 5500c's sent out by HP are defective, so if you like gambling, go ahead and purchase one of these babies.  You might get a good one.  I, on the other hand, will be returning mine tomorrow and reinstalling my Epson 2450.

Do not buy this scanner
If you're looking for a good quality scanner, stay away from this one. The automatic photo feeder looks nice, too bad it's not functional. Apparently, I'm not the only one who had this problem. <br /><br />It did, however, work okay for regular scanning of documents and photos. Unfortunately, only after a little over a year this scanner does not function at all. As a result, I'm currently shopping for a new one, and I will not even consider an HP product this time around.

A bad product
When I first purchased this product, I liked it - I must admit.  After a while though, I realized what a piece of crap it is.  The picture feeder is decent, but gets stuck all the time, and to get it to work I had to remove the sticky stuff from the underside of the lid which continues to leave a residue that has to be cleaned. Forget scanning the negatives - the negative scanner doesn't work very well - especially with the software that comes with it.  I use the scanner with a Mac with OS X 10.2 and 10.3 - and the software is horrible and difficult to use - even to begin a scan.  Now I can't even get the USB cord to stay into the back.  I bought the product at a considerable discount as an open box which is the only thing that's keeping me from being utterly pissed off.

Dismal product, even worse tech support
Worked great out of the box and for the first few months, and then it stopped working. Period. Just gave me an error message telling me to call tech support when I'd try to scan. After several emails failed to solve the problem (Reply #1: Try unplugging it and plugging back in. Response #1: Nope. Didn't fix it. Reply #2. Turn it off. Unplug all the cables from it. Wait 5 minutes. Reconnect cables. Response #2: Nope, still broken. Reply #3: Try unplugging it and ...) I gave up and tried live chat. And, they replaced it. Their dime to ship it. Even though it was a gift and I had no receipt. Great service, I thought.<br>So, fast forward a few months and the new one stopped working. Big white stripe down each scan like there's a burnt out pixel or something. So, I emailed tech support. They have clearly reduced the skill level of their tech support. The number of emails I have traded has been ridiculous. The last one ended with the tech saying he didn't think there was warranty coverage. Frustrated, I tried live chat. After a painfully slow chat (think 15 minutes per response), the guy told me to call their toll-free number. That was it. <br>I'm pretty upset here. Upset enough to spend an afternoon at CompUSA trying to dissuade people from buying HP products. Amazing how quickly their tech support went from world-class to being a factor which will dissuade me from buying their stuff again.

Wretched
I bought this scanner about six months ago, needing a photo feeder - I have<br>about 5,000 archived photos that I want in electronic format.  Unfortunately,<br>the hardware and the software are both deeply flawed, and automated <br>scanning is not feasible.<p>The problem with the hardware is that the feeder is too sensitive to so-called<br>&quot;jams&quot;.  When a photo is sent to the angled output tray, if it does not precisely<br>fall into position immediately it prevents a plastic lever from snapping back into<br>place - and then falsely reports a &quot;jam&quot; and halting processing of the stack,<br>even though absolutely nothing is preventing it from starting to move the<br>next photo into position.  The only way to avoid this is to grab each photo<br>as it arrives in the output tray and pull it out of the way of the lever,<br>making unattended bulk scanning impossible.<p>The software is even worse.  The interface is clumsy - apparently designed by<br>the suits to be as non-confusing as possible by presenting no options and<br>little feedback while a scan is underway.  It is easy to make an elementary<br>mistake like scanning an entire stack of photos at the wrong resolution because<br>the software gives no indication of which profile it is about to use when<br>scanning starts.  But worst of all is its exception handling.  If any sort of<br>error occurs, not only are you almost certain to lose the scan currently in<br>progress, but on occasion every scan of the entire session will disappear!<p>I could hardly believe it.  Rather than saving each photo after it's successfully<br>scanned in, the included software keeps them in memory (or in some unknown disk<br>location), saving them only at the end the session.  There have been times when<br>I have lost ten or more photos just because one of those near the end encountered<br>one of the false &quot;jam&quot; reports described above - and the software gave only a<br>useless error message and ended without saving any of the scans.<p>There are plenty of minor flaws as well. Photos are not cropped, and part of <br>the scanner hardware always appears at the edges of a 4x6 print.   Very little<br>customization of the buttons is possible (I consider the &quot;E-Mail&quot; and &quot;WWW&quot; <br>buttons absolutely useless, as I have my own workflow for getting photos to<br>my website, yet it won't allow me to use them for something else).  And no<br>customization of output filenames when automatically scanning a series of<br>photos is possible.  <p>I regretted this purchase from the second day I owned the scanner, but thought<br>I could overcome its flaws.  Standing by the scanner for twenty minutes tonight,<br>pulling photo after photo out of the output tray (for every single one of them<br>failed to fall into the one position that wouldn't cause a false &quot;jam&quot; report),<br>I realized this was a lost cause and I am now in the market for an automated<br>photo feeder that actually works.<p>Do not, under any circumstances, buy this product.

Huge Disappointment
Although I did not buy this from Amazon, and picked it up for a great price, I guess you get what you pay for.  A huge disappointment in this printer. I've had Epson and HP printers and will go back to HP with the next paycheck. This Epson does print a good quality photo print -- but if you're wanting an easy, reliable machine for all your other general printing, this isn't the machine for you. It jams easily, won't let you print to the edge on plain paper setting, you can not print on transparencies, and often will not let me input instructions for which it is suppose to be able to do. The scan is OK, the copy part of the machine is fine. Using the #69 ink cart. I printed out 50 pictures and ran out of ink with fresh cartridges.  That was about 72 cents a photo (and poor quality to boot) -- I can do better at a photo shop.

Programmed to prevent refill of cartridges.
I am very disappointed with my Epson NX415.  I went to Staples to purchase ink to refill the cartridge.  I saw that the replacement cartridges were upward of $70, so I decided to refill the current cartridges.  By the way, If a single cartridge is low, the printer is programmed not to allow you to print.  Apparently you cannot ever reuse a cartridge that has been depleted nor one that has reached a certain level and has been removed and replaced (Of course you wouldn't know this unless you read the manual, and since there is no hard copy, you probably wouldn't find this out until you download the disks.  At this point the printer would probably not be returnable). If you are one who is on a budget or who does not like to throw away money, then DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER.  HP and Lexmark would print for me, even if the colored ink was low or empty - but the Epson will not.  Every time you print you are bombarded with an ink level display and an advertisement to purchase genuine Epson cartridges.

A Printer to STAY FAR AWAY FROM:
We Purchased this printer a few months ago (August 2009):  A Total Piece of Junk.<br />It printed 4 documents - read that 4 - and the ink tanks where down 50 per cent.<br />After 15 documents at non-photo quality, the ink tanks where empty.  The printer<br />spent more time cleaning itself time after time.  Don't spend your good hard-earned<br />money on this piece of junk.  Epson laid a egg with this model (Like most of them).<br />The Ink Cartidges cost more than the printer (not surprised),  but we dumped for another model.  Stay Far away from this monster, unless you loved being frustrated<br />and told that your ink cartridges are "not recognized" or empty after a short use.<br />This monster sucks more liquids than a runner on steroids.  <br />                                                                                                                                          Danxo (WJ Group)

Terrible. DO NOT BUY!
So far, buying this printer has cost me time and money. I now have an inferior product that sprays ink all over my documents and goes incredibly slow. The software is clunky. I had an ancient HP printer forever and it was good for something like 5 years. I got this thing a week ago and i already regret it. So much for technological advancement in the world of printers. This thing performs terribly in comparison to the dinosaur printer I had before.

Pain in the You-Know-What
This printer does not accurately estimate ink levels.  I recently (yesterday) replaced the black ink cartridge and at that time all the other levels were fine.  I printed maybe four pages and the Cyan was supposedly completely empty.  My printer is now refusing to print anything (including black and white) until I replace the Cyan cartridge.  <br /><br />So basically after going out of my way and buying a new cartridge so I'd be able to print, my printer decided that another color was too low and now won't function and I have no way to print my important papers.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Absolute Piece of Junk
I have owned Epson Printers for years and this is the first model that I've had a problem with.  Epson, in their infinite wisdom, has decided to build into their printers some sort of block on third party ink cartridges in order to force you to buy their overpriced cartridges.  When you attempt to install any third party cartridge, a built in command kicks in and you are blocked from using the printer function.  This basically makes the printer useless- unless you give in and buy their stock.   In addition, the printer is noisy and the print quality with their ink installed is lousy.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Poor Text Printing
Relatively fast printing. Since the industry standard is to rate 15% of a page to determine print speed, I seriously doubt any printer will ever live up to it's rated speed. But, in real world standards, this does print relatively fast.<br />I'm unimpressed by how fast this printer prints, since with "text quality" printing, it is unacceptable. Due to the fact the most common complaint about this printer is ink waste, I attempted to print in "draft mode". Draft mode is inherently poor quality. However, I was shocked as to just how poor it was. My previous HP 2400 series (many years old printer)"fast draft" mode (that HP had "fast draft" "draft" and "normal" modes, and higher quality)is light years ahead of this Epson printer's "draft" mode; and text quality mode, for that matter. Text quality is, as stated before, unacceptable, particularly if you print anything that requires someone to read the document; such as a note to self, on your things to do today list, like Return Epson Printer; immediately if not sooner. If your needs require something more professional, such as a resume, use of this printer will most assuredly hinder your chances of getting in the door, and will more than likely find it's way into the "circular file".<br />"Text quality" is extremely light and extremely jagged. Video cards use a feature to sharpen video, it's called antialiasing. This printer needs heavy antialiasing to sharpen the edges, to provide crisp and sharp text. <br />Since I have already made it known I have no intention of keeping this no-quality printer, I would have no problem wasting ink to test higher quality print levels. However, I wish not to waste the paper. <br />What makes this so bad is Epson's claims of great print quality. "Budget printer without the sacrifice" I recall seeing. But, the reverse is true "Sacrifice without the budget printer", if all the claims are true of rapid ink consumption. <br /><br />The software available is moderate, at best, providing basics for photo editing. <br /><br />Contents include the printer, instructions, power cord, ink cartridges, CD with drivers, optional software. I guess a $100 printer does not afford the company to spend the extra nickle for the required USB cable. Fortunately, USB cables are cheap enough now I had plenty around. <br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />Not worth the $50 paid. Granted, I don't expect laser print quality for $50; despite Epson's claim it is twice as good. But, I don't expect my own handwritten print to be higher and better quality either. And, here is the sad thing: people have spent the full $100 on this. I suspect an extra $20-50 spent on an HP would be worth the extra money. <br /><br />Edited to add additional thoughts:<br />Drivers updated. Printed an article using Best Photo quality, and of course there was improved print quality, yet, unbelievable results. Even with this printer's best quality, the text was no better than what one would expect from a printer at default settings. Interestingly, the text I printed used an 18-20 pt font size, in the tubular type variety, and in color. In "Best photo" the result was similar to a photo print on normal typical non-glossy paper. Blurry, and muddled. A smaller 6 pt font in black came out as if printed in fast draft. <br />One another note: the printer can be extremely loud. After updating the drivers, testing in normal text and image quality mode, upon print start, I was startled by the "crashing" sound from the cartridge's motions. A Lexmark I had did this once, and needless to say, it didn't last very long, as the damage to to spool was too intense to absorb the shock of completing it's cycle. I suspect the same would be true of this printer. <br />The cartridge did move slower on Best Photo quality, so, that would be a way to prevent excess damage. If you're willing to go through ten times the ink, to save a sub-par over-priced $50 printer.

Prepare To Buy Lots of ink
I bought this printer because it was such a good deal. The price was $44. But I recommend against buying it for one simple reason: it goes through the ink (even the colors you don't use) like water. It prints fast - really fast. I tried to print a photo over the weekend and was really really disappointed. So, if you like to spend lots of money on ink, this is the printer for you!

Horrible printer with even worse support!
Absolutely pathetic printer. Have to reinstall it every couple of weeks. Re-installing takes hours if you are trying to get the driver from the Lexmark website! Wireless always loses connection and resets. I dont even bother trying to use the wireless feature even though I have a powerful wireless network in my house. The support for this printer is as bad as the printing quality! Lexmark website is no help at all and when you go to download new drivers (because my printer decided to reset itself and disappeared from my Mac) none of the links work!<br /><br />Stick with Canon or a better brand than Lexmark!!!! I thought this printer would be great seeing as I dont expect too much from a printer (not printing photos) but I am thinking about literally throwing it in the trash and getting a different brand.<br /><br />

It prints... sometimes.
I just moved and I needed a printer to print out some resumes, so I go to Wal-Mart or Fred Meyer or some other such store to pick one up for all my home office needs. I had a Lexmark All-In-One type printer before , which I LOVED and couldn't be happier with (the model which I do not remember), so I decide to go Lexmark again and figure this is the updated version with the fancy wireless option, to go perfectly with my new laptop.<br /><br />Well, since then, I still have not figured out how to set up the wireless, I have an error message pop-up almost every time I try to print. It's extremely difficult to load the paper so that it actually feeds, and sometimes the paper jams regardless. Sometimes when I try to print, it freezes my browser. Just now, I tried to print a multiple-page document (my e-ticket for a flight home this weekend) and it only printed page one.<br /><br />Overall, there is rarely a time that I try to print something without some sort of frustration or difficulty involved. I really don't know what happened with this one.

Not very good
Running on HP G60-120 laptop with Win 7.  Communicates wirelessly without issues except that 1] that it continually jams or doesn't feed the paper and 2] when it does print wirelessly, it literally takes 15 minutes to print a single page of simple text from a Word file.  Same problem with printing from any any other sort of file.  Scans a document just fine and in a fairly timely manner so long as you are not in a hurry.  Lexmark tech support was NO help and un-impressive overall.  I have two laptops of same kind [one is my wife's] so I set it up with her unit which still has Vista, and had the identical problems so it isn't the OS probably.  Pretty much a waste of money and would be suitable as a small boat anchor if not so flimsy.  Switched back [hardwired] to my old HP Office Jet printer.

Forget about using the wireless!
I read the previous reviews of this printer/scanner and knew ahead of time about the flaky wireless problems.  Since I am very well versed in networking and for the money I thought I would give it a shot.<br /><br />Out of the box, it would see my network (SSID) but simply could not acquire an IP address.  You cannot enter it in manual (Static IP) which is completely useless.  The software setup gives you the option to just "move on" and use the USB only.  Completely not acceptable.  <br /><br />I thought that in my simple home network with NO security enabled that I would have a shot, but Lexmark has taken away any normal networking control.  It is packed up to be returned.

Most problems I've ever had with a product
I tried to install the driver for the printer on THREE different Toshiba laptops- two with Vista OS the other with Windows XP- One Vista laptop was only two weeks old- There was no problem in setting up the wireless- BUT I kept receiving error messages about the Spooler- this was consistent across all three laptops- I spent more than 3 hours with a Lexmark technician on-line trying to fix and or diagnose the problem- To no avail- I tried various ploys- disabling Virus program, using Microsoft Fixit which removed all other printer drivers, etc. Nothing worked- I eventually have returned this product. <br /><br />I am not a computer scientist and shouldn't even have to know about spoolers etc. to set up a machine like this. Beware!

Nice printer when it works, cheap for a reason
Bought this printer in April. Probably printed 20 pages on it in 3 months since I have another printer hooked up. When it worked it printed great pictures. Ink cartridges ran run out too quickly though.  In July it died.  Got a "paper jam" error without any paper in it.  Contacted HP service, which is overseas in Asia now.  Mostly the rep read off what you can find on their web page. Most of the time I couldn't understand him anyway. It wasted 1 hr until they agreed to send a remanufactured one to replace the broken printer.  10 days later, the replacement showed up. All was well until the next morning.  The color cartridge has some kind of leaked and I needed to run the clean cycle a few time to get it to print in color every time the printer sat for more than 12 hrs.  With how little ink is in the HP 95, this was a problem.  So I called them again this time I spoke to a supervisor. They sent another remanufactured printer.  10 days later is showed up. And guess what, it doesn't work.  The second replacement will not power up. This was after the supervisor said he would make sure QA double checked the printer before it went out....  Currently I'm working with a case manager (one step higher than a supervisor), who is not very helpfully. It's been three days and still no solution.  I originally bought a C4150, and they sent a c4180.  Seems like there are a lot of broken 4180s.  If they send back a 4150, I'll return it and get my money back and buy a Canon.   Its too bad, my old HP printer is 7 yrs old and working great.  I wanted an all in one to clear up some space..

After paper jam and it won't run anymore
I have this printer for just over 1 1/2 yr with very light usage...just finished the original ink and put in 2 brand new HP cartridges 2 weeks ago and was still working ok up to yesterday.  I tried printing an email today and did not pay attention to the paper tray which only had 3 pieces of paper left.  Paper jam!!  The roller fed all 3 paper into it.  After clearing the paper jam from the back of the printer (the paper was intact without any missing piece), I was not able to make it work again....paper jam error won't go away no matter what I did. A called to HP 800 # got me an Indian customer service rep.  She would not even patch my call to support since the warrrenty has expired.  In order to talk to technical support, I would have to pay $35 to have support for 14 days.  I am going to junk it and look for another brand.  What a waste of money for a good looking printer with all the cool functions but does not last. <br /><br />Edit:<br />I almost junk it...then I found a fix...not from HP but from other user.  Check this out if you have the same paper jam problem: http://www.fixya.com/support/t203152-hp_photosmart_c4180_phantom_paper_jam<br /><br />This link just save me $70 to have it exchanged by HP.

Not Worth the Trouble
This printer was a great deal when I purchased it, but quickly caused me more trouble than it was worth. It printed great photos, was fairly easy to operate, and I liked it most of the time. However, it frequently did not want to work, caused my computer to lock up, and jammed. Then, after only having it for less than 90 days, it just quit working at all. Though this may be just a bad model, I will never own another HP product again.

Sounded like a good idea at the time
Personally, I think it has the potential to be a good product. Given that HP has now made several upgrades to this model (C5180,6180,7180, C4280, etc...), I think they agree. Personally, I would skip this model for one of the upgrades, or possibly another brand entirely. <br />Here's why.   <br />I'm on C4180 #3 for the year. Actually, third in 10 months. <br />My family got the first one in December of 2006, mainly to scan photos. I took it with me back to grad school, thinking having my very own scanner would be beneficial. For the 14 weeks it worked, it was great. One day, it just refused to turn off unless unplugged. It also refused to complete the turn-on process, staying in printer limbo. HP, after over 3 hours on the customer service line, finally decided to send me a replacement.<br />Three weeks ago, the scanner/copier option failed on that model. So they have since sent me another. Mind you, the consumer absorbs the shipping cost.

A TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD PRINTER!
This is one of the worst HP products that I have bought in 13 years!  It is flimsy, has no output tray and the photo paper feed jams.  Even the HP technician told me that, for the money, I should upgrade to the 5100 series -  which I did.  For $50 more my HP 5180 is conversely the best HP product that I have ever bought -- and an elegant compliment to my new iMac 24".

User interface design by morons.
When you install the HP printer software it installs two different scan driver interfaces: TWAIN and HP-WIA. Why are there two interfaces? What is the difference? I don't know. They both suck in different ways and both have stupid default that you cannot change. Neither interface remembers the last settings you used. You have to reset all the options for EVERY scan. Both default to 200 DPI. Why 200 DPI? The TWAIN driver gives you more options, but it ALWAYS turns on automatic color adjustments and sharpness enhancement. You should never, ever allow your scan device to automatically adjust your pictures for you. You should do this in a paint program or photo adjustment tool where you will get much better results. All I freakin want from a scanner is to just give me the raw data and I'll take it from there. I understand that some people just want to be spoon-fed, but at least let expert users change the default.<br /><br />This printer has a little color-LCD screen with menus and stuff to lure you into the notion that it might be easy to do quick scans without having to open a scan program on your computer. Near the LCD screen is a HELP button. Do not be fooled by this button. They might as well have labeled it the "RTFM Button". You should be suspicious of any feature on an HP device that claims to be helpful because if you press the HELP button you can be sure that it will be in no way helpful. Most often it seems to actually mock you. When you press the HELP button it will either tell you that you should "refer to device documentation" or it will tell you exactly what you can already see printed on the other printer buttons. For example, if you press the "Copy Menu" button then press "HELP" it will tell you "Press START Copy Black or START Copy Color to start the copy." Ah! Yes, I see. This must refer to the two buttons "START Copy Black" and "START Copy Color". These are the ONLY two buttons next to the Copy button. So the HELP button confirms that I have not hallucinated these two buttons.<br /><br />The scanner has the "feature" of scanning directly to a memory card instead of going through your computer. There are four different memory card sockets on the front. For reasons that I am sure are stupid they don't include USB as one of the sockets. I'm guessing that nobody ever wants to scan to a memory card so that they can view the scan in their camera. Probably most people want to scan to a memory card so that they can plug it into a computer later on. Some computers do have memory card sockets, but all of them have USB sockets. So, why does HP let you scan to camera memory but not to USB memory?<br /><br />When you scan directly to a memory card it gives no options. They decided that you would only ever want to scan at 200 DPI. I think the optical resolution of the printer is 600 DPI or highter. I could find no way to set the default. Hmmm... this reminds me of the TWAIN and WIA scan interfaces. 200 DPI is a stupid default, so I thought there must be a way to change this. In a moment of weakness, I pressed the HELP button: "refer to Device Documentation." Curse you, HP!<br /><br />If you are familiar with the Peanuts comic strip then you know the ones where Lucy entices Charlie Brown with a football setup to punt and she always pulls the football away at the last second and Charlie Brown falls on his back. This seems to be the game that HP is playing with this device.<br /><br />I could go on more about how much the printer part of this device sucks, but I'm tired and angry. It's just as bad as the scanner... I should go outside and get some fresh air.<br /><br />I hate this device.<br />

Unreliable, same jam problems as mentioned
I purchased a C4180 in late 2006, the printer was very easy to set up and I loved the features. Soon it started having feed problems however, and eventually quit working altogether. A call to HP yielded fast and courteous service, I was impressed with how they handled a replacement. Got the new printer, and it worked fine for awhile then started misfeeding and giving the carriage jam errors that have been mentioned here. They want $35 to service the printer as a one time fee, but it is starting to look as there is an inherent design flaw in this model and i'm just going to find another one. The features and performance of this printer would have yielded a 4 or 5 star rating from me, but alas it's worthless if it will not do something as simple as feed a sheet of paper.

THINKING HP ?  NEVER AGAIN !
I had purchased this as a backup for my epson photo printer. Got to use it about 6 times-something was burning inside of it so I contacted HP and go so much grief then kept tellime me the warrantee was up and I informed them it wasn't up till July 2008 and it was a defaulty workmanship so they had to make good on it. Well to make a long story short after about a month of this they finally replaced it-With another broken one! I'm considering this a lesson in life-count my losses and Don't buy HP products ever, ever, again!

Don't buy this printer!!!!!!
I just bought this printer and came home to install it. I followed the directions step by step. everything started smoothly, and the alignment sheet printed fine. As I began the software installation, I heard a pop. The printer had no lights of any kind. I tried the on button, checked the cables, and even replaced the surge supressor, but the unit would not power up. I went online, read some of the reviews, and found tons of people with the same problem. In the mean time the software had frozen my computer. I promptly returned the printer and purchased the cannon mp600. Hp's used to be so good what happened. <br /><br />P.S. For all the people who complain about printers. No printers come with usb cables, inkjets go through ink quick, you have to read the directions before you do stuff like connect the usb cable. This is standard operating procedure.

Poor
We received a lemon printer.  The printer has typically been good, but the printer  we received did not work.  We have recently contacted the seller to send the printer back to their store for a refund.  The seller did respond and approved for us to send it back to his store.

MAC users, get your wallet ready.
Functionally, this printer works.  Print quality is very good.  <br /><br />HERE's the issue.  There is no way to adjust print quality when using a MAC.  I use this same exact printer on both my MAC and my PC.  With the PC I've got a bunch of options to adjust to "fast draft", so that I can save money printing.  With the MAC drivers HP has included there is no such option.  So each time you print, you are using maximum ink!!!!<br /><br />VERY costly to run.  Cartridges are expensive and I go through a lot of them.  Time to switch printers -- this one just isn't good for MAC<br /><br />Ocassionaly there are problems printing photos using my PC -- lots of colored lines through the photo.  Nothing seems to fix that, but when I print from iPhoto with the MAC, it doesn't happen.<br /><br />So there you go -- works perfectly with MAC, but insanely expensive.  Problematic photo printing with Windows XP SP2, but cheaper to operate.  Great combination!<br /><br />

This is the worst piece of crap you can buy!
LISTEN CLOSE BUYERS:<br />If I could give this product zero stars I would, but since 1 star is the minimum I had no choice.<br />I bought this printer at [...] (and don't worry, Amazon, I buy lots of stuff from you too)<br />I felt the obligation to go in here and serve us all, since Amazon is the best place for product reviews.<br />I am a hi-tech professional so whatever I say about my experience with this piece of junk will be ten times worse for the average user.<br />1. The first thing that I was shocked about is that the printer will often not take in the paper properly - it just won't! - this leads to errors, jams, paper waste - you name it.<br />2. The display is PATHETIC. I didn't expect an iPhone screen, but a single line display with merely 10 characters at a time??? oh and unless the display is under a bright spotlight, you'll never get the chance to read what it is telling you! That is so cheap, HP!<br />3. The software provided with this printer is bloated with millions of unnecessary components that have only to do with marketing (and you wonder why your computer is running slow all of the sudden?) - unless you are an advanced user (and choose the advanced option) - I really don't envy you.<br />4. I have tested this printer for about an hour with all of it's functionality and I could easily get the scanner to hang as well, after which everything froze and you literally had to pull the plug out and put back in to reset it. The main switch button did not do any good. I would expect a printer to be turned off properly even if it costs $10. That was the last straw.<br />The only good thing I can say about this printer is that printing and scanning (when they worked in the first hour of its life) were decent.<br />But what is it worth it if the product malfunctions 3 times in the first hour of its life?<br />Once I am done writing this review - the printer is going back to HP.<br />SHAME ON YOU HP TO SELL US SUCH JUNK!<br />I REMEMBER AN HP 15 YEARS AGO WITH MUCH MORE ROBUST PRINTERS.<br />AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED - YOUR REPUTATION IS RUINED.<br /><br />

can't wait to return this machine
This printer was okay for about the first few weeks I had it.  However, I quickly found the ink jets ran out of ink.  Thinking it might be because they were the sample jets that came with the purchase, I thought replacements might perform better. NO!  Also, I now have a similar problem to another reviewer, in that I am getting a constant error message that my black inkjet in incompatible.  I have to unplug, plug, reallign the jets and perhaps will get one print job before I get the message again. HP was nice, and say they will replace this, but I think this is a cheap machine, and I guess as they say, you get what you pay for.  Also, noisy.

Horrible
All of a sudden, the printer will refuse to recognize the ink cartridge. Contacted HP and they don't seem to care. Had this same problem with other HP printers. Gets expensive to replace a nearly full ink cartridges because of this error. I don't know how HP has managed to corner the market on printers.

Printer cartridge lasted less than a week with light use.
The printer works okay; it is a little slow and it does stop mid-print.  However, the biggest problem is that the first cartridge lasted less than a week with very light use, as in, not in an office, one of three printers I can use at home, really light use.  I think HP is selling these printers very cheap but reducing the ink in the cartridges they use. Now, I've been travelling for a month and when I hooked up my laptop tonight, the printer wouldn't work.  It worked fine when I left, but, it now insists it has an incompatible cartridge in it.  It's the same, new cartridge that worked when I left. Bah, hum bug.

Great promise - TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRINTER!
I purchased this printer with a lot of enthusiasm for all of the features at a great price and the fact that it was an HP product. Now, after installing it and using it for the past month, I am dumbfounded. How in the world did something this terrible get released by HP? The quality and reliability of the paper feed is poor and worst, the reliability of the scanner auto feed is pathetic. I rarely get a page to feed into the scanner without multiple efforts, and that's with perfectly flat pages. Anything that is evenly slightly bent up is impossible to get to feed.<br /><br />Additionally, the supporting software is obnoxious, presenting dialog after dialog of unnecessary information... I could go on and on, but no point.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I am frankly embarrassed for HP and the product management team that allow something like this out into the marketplace. It has tainted the respect I've had for HP printers over the years and I am now skeptical of buying another HP product if this is any indication of where they have evolved to.<br /><br />Ok, maybe the old adage "You get what you pay for" applies here, because it was ridiculously inexpensive, but shame on the HP manager that jeopardized the HP brand reputation by letting this thing get out the door. Geez guys, did anyone even bother to test it a bit? And from what I've read here, it's not due to me getting a bad unit... almost all of the reviews here are equally down on this... ok, I've vented and will go out and find something else.<br />

Terrible printer.
Friend of mine bought two of these from Costco - one for her, one for a friend.<br /><br />Both printers had similar problems.  Refuses to recognize black print cartridge at times and the only solution is to throw away the almost full cartridge and unwrap new one.  Then the print quality goes bad when the cartridge is half full.<br /><br />Combine this with HP's incredibly bloated and often non-functional software.<br /><br />One printer is in the garbage and the other will join it soon - both are less than a year old.

Worst printer for the money
I have had this unit for over 6 months now.  The people at HP must have been drunk when they programmed this thing!  If you have a paper jam, It thinks it needs to feed a page in and print that you are unable to print.  How is that supposed to ever work!?  That is despite the fact that the thing has a display it could say paper jam on.  The sensor that detects the pages you want to copy goes bad almost monthly and I have replaced this unit many times already.  I have had good luck with HP printers in the past, but this is definitely the last HP I ever buy!

On Win7, Scanner OR Printer, not both
I bought a J4550 right after Windows 7 shipped. After plugging it in to my brand new Win7 computer, I couldn't get it to print, though it could scan. I contacted HP's tech support, and after five hours they basically gave up and told me that I'd need to wait for a new driver, because, "Windows 7 is a new product."<br /><br />After messing with it on my own for a while, I discovered that by using a different driver I could get the thing to print, but in doing so the scanner was disabled. <br /><br />Now that Win7 has been out for a while I decided to retry. No dice: the "new" driver does the same thing as the last. Again I tried HP's tech support, and got the same result (I have no idea why the guy wanted me to unplug the USB cable and plug it back in again when I had just told him that I'm able to scan with it). <br /><br />The bottom line is that whenever I want to switch between printing and scanning, I have to install a different driver. I do *NOT* recommend this product.

Piece of crap
Definitely a worthless piece of crap and the worst HP product I have ever used and I have been buying HP since 1986.  Got mine from Costco and the scanner worked for one day then stopped. Spent many hours trying to fix it and then took it back and got a replacement. At costco the guy in front of me was also returning his 4550 printer as well; small world i thought to myself at the time  The second printer worked for a few weeks and then same issue - scanner does not scan.  Also display is absolutely pathetic with no brightness setting and an odd angle that makes it difficult to read unless you have both a light source and the printer is lower than your head. Software is bloated and useless. Obviously someone in marketing at hp wanted a cheap printer with sub quality parts where they could make money in toner supplies.

Dont buy this if you have Windows 7, Not supported. The CD will not install on Windows 7 because it says operating system not supported.

HP should be ashamed of itself
DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$ YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR and this is the worst printer I've ever had. The printer works okay - if you can get it to work. The paper feeder is by far its weakest link. It can only handle a few sheets at a time and constantly jams or claims that the feeder is empty when it isn't. The quality of print is good, but the ink runs out extremely fast, even on fast draft. Seems like HP just slapped this one together to make themselves some money. It is a shame that a company that has built itself on trust and reputation has rested on its laurels and now produces crap. Producing a printer that cannot perform its most basic function, i.e., print, is like an auto manufacturer producing a vehicle that has malfunctioning steering. The only difference is that the auto manufacturer would be sued!

Horrible experience with treadmill and Merrit Fitness
We had a horrible experience with this treadmill. It arrived non functioning. Customer support takes forever to contact and most of the time offers an option to leave a number for a call back that never once came. After two visits from a tech and two seperate parts deliveres, the treadmill still didn't work. Merrit/Horizon/Johnson Health evidently told the tech they would replace it, but did not make any attempt to contact me. I called again and after being on hold for 30 minutes, was forced to leave my number and a message. Still no call back. I would not buy anything from this company, Horizon or Johnson Fitness ever again.<br /><br />On the positive side, one quick call to Amazon got me a full refund and free pickup of this large, useless item. Amazon.com really stepped up and took care of the situation in one call. They're paying to pick it up and I don't even have to take it apart and put it in the box. Fantastic service from Amazon.

It was nice - when it worked
I purchased this treadmill after reading the good reviews it received - wish my experience could have been the same.  It arrived in good condition, set up was a little difficult, but manageable.  Then, I plugged it in and turned it on and nothing.  No lights, no sounds, no movement.  I did the troubleshooting from the website with no luck.  So I called Horizon Fitness - but you can't actually talk to a person, you leave a number and they call you back.  After 2 weeks of playing phone tag with the company, someone finally sent me instructions on how to take the motor cover off and check the wiring. (for future reference, email works better with this company) Turns out the main plug wasn't plugged into the components board.  I plugged it in and happy day, I had a functioning treadmill.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Yesterday during my nominal 30 minute gentle walk, the incline control starting going crazy - put me up to 10% and wouldn't go back down. Today, I tried again and now none of the buttons work and the treadmill won't go.  I pushed buttons, reset, turned off and back on, unplugged and replugged, went online and did the troubleshooting, all to no avail.  This treadmill is a waste of time and money - and I'm so disappointed, because I really did like it when it worked.

not worth the trouble
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DEV3HG">Merit Fitness 725T Treadmill</a><br /><br />Assembly started off being easy until I got up to the LEFT CONSOLE MAST (POLE), the holes for the bolts were not aligned with the holes in the Console Mast Support Tube so setting it up was impossible, then i decided to take another route & try to attach the CONSOLE MASTS to the CONSOLE before attaching it to the BASE FRAME, the flaw in the plan was that the metal plates where the bolt holes are were crooked so it didn't fit in snuggly the way it should be. So none of it worked out AND THIS WAS AFTER 9hrs of trying different things. <br />I guess if you get lucky and your machine comes with no uneven holes or bent metal plates then it might be a good investment, but you never know what you're going to get!

huge disappointment
I ordered the Horizon 725T treadmill based on the price and excellent reviews.  We're pretty mechanically savvy, but putting this together has been a nightmare.  First, there were parts missing, which,when we called, they said they would send the washers out and that we couldn't pick them up at any hardware.  Ok, we waited five days and again the washers we needed were missing.  We decided to start putting it together and see if these really were necessary.  Then we had a major issue with the cord.  If we installed it the way the instruction book read, it would cut the cord.  As we turned it over to investigate what the problem was, we discovered the plastic on the right side bottom was cracked halfway through.  <br /><br />Although this came packaged beautifully and looked brand new, I'm beginning to wonder if we got a returned or refurbished treadmill or just a lemon.  <br /><br />I really looked forward to getting started with this and am terribly disappointed.  We will probably end up returning this and possibly having them replace it, but we are really leary and hate this waste of time when we could have been using it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DEV3HG">Merit Fitness 725T Treadmill</a>

Installation is beyond ridiculous!
I've read a lot of the reviews here before purchasing my unit. Some of the most often heard complaints were that its heart meter does not work too well and that the installation was difficult.  We decided that the heart meter was not a priority and that since I was an engineer we would not face the same sort of installation pitfalls that confronted soooooo many other consumers.  Don't get me wrong, I'm very good at putting things together.  I'm not being arrogant, it's something I really enjoy doing.  Unfortunately, the difficulties are due to poor construction!  You'd have an easier time if you can bend solid metal.  The pieces were soldered together at an incorrect angle and the screws just did not fit.  We ended up leaving one of the screws off cuz the angle was too far off (about half an inch!).  I was insanely frustrated and would not wish this experience upon anyone.  This was clearly made in China where there they do not believe in quality assurance.

Bad Experience
When my machine arrived it was not working properly. The motor is making a very loud noise. I understand that sometimes there are problems with equipment; however, I am extremley dissappointed in Bowflex customer service. Everytime I have called there has been an minimum of a 30 minute wait to speak with someone. Once I got someone live, they agreed that the machine needed repair. They said I would be receiving a call from a repair person to fix the machine. That was over 5 days ago and I still have not been contacted. For the price of this equipment, my expectations are to receive proper working equipment and great customer service. This has been extremely inconvenient. <br /><br />The machine was easy to put together and looks like it would be great if it worked, but if you receive a defective machine good luck with customer service. <br /><br /><br /><br />

Poor service Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill
I purchased the Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill 11/06 and it was great. However, in Mar. 2007 the rear roller became noisy. I contacted the company and they immediately shipped a "front" roller by mistake. The technician could not find anything wrong so he did nothing.<br />The rear roller noise became extremely loud and we've contacted the company. They initially said they would ship a rear roller but now they cannot give any date at all.<br />We're not pleased with the service. We need the treadmill for walking. My husband Jim had a stroke 2 years ago and he was walking 4 miles per day outside then on the treadmill but he cannot use it now.

Hunk Of Junk - Made in China - Incredibly bad customer service - DO NOT BUY
My machine arrived to my house, the delivery person was great, helped me push it into the house. <br /><br />Initially, while assembling the treadmill, I noticed the machining of all the hardware was pathetic: bolt threads were poorly matched to slots, some were finished poorly and had smooth hex edges, thus becoming stripped. I didn't make a big fuss about this, as I was able to tighten them with my own tools without fully stripping them (I'm a mechanic). USE YOUR OWN TOOLS if you put this together, because the tools provided are machined poorly as well, and will surely strip the bolts provided.<br /><br />So I put it all together, I turn the machine on, and it keeps erroring out after 5 seconds. I call Bowflex's parent company Nautilus. Here is where it gets interesting. <br /><br />I speak to a customer representative, and explain the error message I'm getting. Instead of offering to send someone out, the rep instructs me to remove the motor cover panel to diagnose the problem. I did this with some trepidation, but continuing, we (I) spent about an hour figuring out the problem. Keep in mind, troubleshooting is being done by myself, and secondarily from a customer service rep reading a schematic, not a service technician. <br /><br />So then, the rep tells me Nautilus will send out the part we are guessing is broken, that I am going to replace it for them, and on top of that, it's going to take 7-10 business days to arrive, as this is Bowflex's "slow" season. So now I'm sitting here waiting, with a defective product. <br /><br />When a company sends defective machinery like this to a customer, they better make sure to remedy the problem in person IMMEDIATELY. They have a headquarters 15 miles from where I live, Nautilus that is. But this is a Bowflex, and apparently they couldn't care less. <br /><br />EDITED: Once the part arrived, it was no small task installing.  I cannot believe they left this up to me to fix; anyone without an advanced understanding of mechanics would likely break this machine trying to install the part which was broken (no assembly instructions came either). <br /><br />Unbelievable.  The machine stopped erroring, but like the person stated above in another review, my heart rate monitor does not work.  Also, the displays keep switching from one to the next, until it stops on the heart rate panel (which does not work on my machine).  What a disaster. <br /> <br /><br />

Wish I could give 0 stars
I was excited to receive these, but within 6 months they were not working well.  They do not always pick up all the weights that I adjust them for and occasionally some of the weights slip out after I pick them up.  These have been a complete disappointment.  I understand, from a personal trainer friend, that the only benefit of these is the brand name - there are a couple of non-Bowflex products that are very similar, cost less and perform better.  My discussions with Bowflex for customer service have been completely unproductive.  If I could rate these as a zero, I would happily do so.

Much better options for adjustable dumbbells
Like everything else Bowflex makes, the Select Tech's are a terrible value and poorly made.  Give them credit though, they continue to brainwash us all into thinking they actually make a decent fitness product.  If you're in the market for adjustable dumbbells try the Powerblocks or Ironmasters.  Both are FAR better constructed and a MUCH better value.  For $349, you can purchase a 5-50lb set of powerblocks that can later be upgraded to 90lbs or 130lbs per hand.  The Select Tech's, at $400, will take you to a MAXIMUM weight of 52.5lbs per hand with no option of upgrading!!  Come on Bowflex, at least understand what your competition is doing.  After the adjusting mechanism broke on mine causing some of the plates to come flying off, I promptly returned them for Powerblocks and couldn't be happier.  Weights are much easier to change, it's constructed from steel vs. plastic, and they are far more evenly balanced than the Select Tech's.  Oh yeah, Powerblocks also have a 10 year warranty vs. the 1 year for Select Tech.

Warning- beware
I had ordered 3 of these for a camping trip and found them to be great.  However, after ordering 20 to give out for my child's birthday party, we read the package warning on the back.<br /><br />Here is it exactly:<br />WARNING:<br />Always wear ANSI approved safety goggles when using this product.  Before using this product, the user should read the operating instructions to understand everything about this product.  Normal everyday use of this product is likely to expose the user to dust and microscopic particles containing lead and other chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm.  Always wear the appropriate clothing and safety equipment when operating this product.  Wash hand thoroughly after the use and handling of this product.<br /><br />That last line is what really made our decision.  When was the last time you had to think about wearing safety goggles and washing your hands after using a flashlight?
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Not that great
I bought 3 of them and all of the flashlights have fallen apart from riding around in my car.  One of the them the front plastic fell out and so did the bulbs.  The other two you have to screw the back off a little bit to get them to light up at all.  I would rather stick with my mag lite.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
They are CHEAP for a reason
At first I thought it was a great light, very bright, and well made. Until a day or two after having it, it starting switching itself off and shining in and out - instead of having a steady beam of light.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
NOT heavy duty, broke the first time I used it.
I had misgivings as soon as I removed this flashlight from it's packaging. It has a thin gauge aluminum case that could easily be dented or torn. When I first powered up this flashlight, I was impressed by the diffused bright light. It lit up close by objects, but offered no illumination for objects more than 10 feet away.<br />My biggest complaint is the reliability. I dropped it once. It stopped working. I am pretty handy with my hands, but I was unable to get the flashlight to light up again.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Avoid - Totally unreliable.
Light flickers, when working. Kept one in my car. Never seems to work when I need it. Kept another in my house, again never seems to work when i need it. Batteries drain quickly, apparently because it's easy to turn on by simply being bumped around. Also, cover has to be screwed on in just the right position or it won't work.

Arrived nonfunctional
The flashlight arrived nonfunctional.  Tried with batteries that came in package, with other (new) batteries, but would not switch on.  Sent back for a refund.

Cheap
I just received this in the mail. The button broke on it the first time I used it. The light is bright, but the housing is cheap. I would not trust it to be durable. If you want a throw away flashlight, then get it. If you need a serious EDC light then skip this, for I would not wish this on my worst enemy.

Pay more, get much more
I bought both this 9-LED unit and one each of the "GIANT Light - Small Package" Flashlights; the 21-LED and 28-LED versions, both for $[...], right here on Amazon.com.  side-by-side, the light put out by the 9-LED unit's embarrassing.  Yes, the 9-LED unit is slimmer; the head is the same size as the barrel, essentially, so it'll slide conveniently into a space the size of a roll of quarters.  But, when you pull it out and use it, if you're lucky, like some here, it will work.  In my case, I have to keep unscrewing and screwing in the battery compartment lid to keep it on... and it *still* flickers off for no reason or if lightly jostled.  Forget it.  <br /><br />The 21- and 28-LED units light up a dark closet like a floodlight.  They're amazing.  For 12 bucks, the 28-LED unit is an excellent deal. Since they're both the same size and price, I'd get it over the 21-LED unit.  LEDs are power misers.  And both units have been rock solid.  And they come with a nifty little nylon velcro-closed belt case.

GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU BUY FROM THE RIGHT MERCHANT
This flashlight is great, it offers really good lighting, and it only uses 3 AAA batteries, making it very efficient.  However, beware who you buy it from.  I've bought three of these flashlights overall.  Two of them came from the merchant ETOOLSCITY, and they worked great.  This merchant sells them with the batteries, and some of them with a little bag to hang from your belt.  The packaging is great and you can tell they are new.  However, the merchant **seller_atl** sold me a poor flashlight.  It was supposed to be a 9-LED light flashlight but instead I received a 8 light flashlight (since one of the 9 small bulbs did not work).  This seller does not include the batteries with the order, and on top of that, the packaging is very poor.  It seems to me that seller_atl sold me a used flashlight when it was supposed to have been new.  I strongly recommend the products from eToolscity, but caution against those from seller_atl.  Although the products might seem the same THEY ARE NOT!  Spend your money wisely on good products that will last a long time, not on cheap, and possibly used products that come defective as it is.

You Get What You Pay For
I needed several small flashlights so I purchased one to evaluate quality - good thing I did because they don't seem any good. The sample I received does not work at all (that is, there is no light output). I put fresh batteries in it but that didn't help. I checked for loose or missing parts but could find no obvious cause for the failure.<br /><br />I then purchased 6 Sears Craftsman LED flashlights for $7.50 on sale. Every one of them works perfectly.<br /><br />(I gave it a one star rating only because I couldn't give it a zero star rating.)

Read the Fine Print
I was first attracted to this product by its small size, excellent light intensity, and price. When I received the package, right on the back was a safety disclaimer. Turns out this product is manufactured in China and the pain they use on it is lead based. More troubling was the fact that warning label advised the user to wear goggles and gloves when using the flashlight. When was the last time anyone had to use flashlights and gloves to use a flashlight. As the proverbial saying goes, you get what you pay for. I just didn't expect that such an simple product would be a detrimental health risk.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Doesn't cost much or do much
This baby sure was cheap,  in both senses of the word. It doesn't project light at all. It may be good for finding keys in a purse, but don't count on it to shine more than 6 inches...not worth the price.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Light sometimes, but wouldn't count on it.
This flashlight is lacking. It flickers on and off and I have repeatedly had to unscrew and then tighten the cap to get good contact with the batteries. The only good thing is it is light and compact, so I keep one in my briefcase. Still, it is annoying to have to shake it or unscrew it about every other time to get a full beam of light. It is not just the one, I bought two and they both act this way, so I believe it is the design or something like that. I bought a couple of similar flashlights at Home Depot and they are much better, cheaper, and work each time. Check around, you may be able to do better.

Please Beware!
This product carries a warning: "Normal everyday use of this product is likely to expose the user to dust and microscopic particles containing lead and other chemicals known in the State of California to cause cancer."<br />Also, I purchased 6, but one didn't work at all. I can get by with 5, but if you order 1 and it doesn't work, you've got nothing!<br />It was my mistake, and I won't repeat it.

This thing SUCKS!!!
Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product!  it constantly double-taps.  By that, I mean that when you stop the timer, it will very often immediately re-start itself.  <br />  What good is a timer that stops for a split second and then starts running again?  <br />  This happens to me about 30%- 40% of the time.  Spend a few buck more, and get a more reliable product.  <br />  If you are a coach or a ref, this little piece of junk will seriously embarrass you!  BEWARE!!!

not a good ride.
We bought this scooter for my 5 year old.  I thought I was getting a safe scooter because of the 3 wheels and I trusted the "Razor" name.  This is such a safe product because it does not glide well at all.  At the speed it goes, a kid doesn't need any safety equipment.  Walking is actually faster and more dangerous than this scooter.  In addition, when my daughter does finally get it to glide (at the most it will glide without using her foot is 2 feet, if that, and very slow)as soon as she puts both her feet on it, the thing stops.  I can't even imagine her using this scooter much at all because it is not fun to constantly pump and not go anywhere.  It is a big waste of money!

Terrible Quality
I regret this purchase. The handle bar doesn't steer well. It keeps making a loud clicking noise when you force it. It is now not true. The white plastic wheel cover is held together poorly - only a plastic male-female snap connection is holding it together. The pedals have slipped off. The plastic that was securing them have cracked. There is also the clicking noise even when the wheels are turning.<br /><br />In short, it's a very cheaply made product. Waste of money if you want any long-term use out of this.

We purchased this for our two year old since her feet touched the pedals.  When pushing it, it's ok. But when she tries it by herself and turns and even leans a little, it tips.  We took it out in the driveway and it tipped with her on it.  She's tried it several times and I don't want her riding it anymore.  It's way too dangerous to use for little ones trying to get started.  Do not recommend for starters.  One positive, she really liked the storage bag in the back.

Helmet doesn't adjust properly!
Although this item is indicated to a range of sizes (and I picked a size with a similar range to my current bike helmet), this helmet just could not adjust to fit properly.  There is no "band" around the head to adjust fit.  So, although one could adjust the neckstrap to make the helmet more snug-seeming, it will never fit around your head properly (unless your head is the EXACT size).  <br /><br />With the fit of this helmet, frankly it isn't safe!  This helmet I'm promptly returning.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Dumb fit
The "smart system" didn't work for me so I must be dumb. I normally wear a large helmet. I fiddled for over an hour trying to get a tight fit and could not.The Bell instructions did not indicate how to tighten up the fit. The back strap is non adjustable. I am returning it.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Cheap Quality
The product claims it is "the best in it's league" which essentially means that this is what you get for what you pay. When looking at the product before I bought it, I though this was a decent buy for the price. Now I realize I should have invested a little more money and gotten myself a better helmet. <br /><br />Day 2 after buying it, the strap came off but I was able to fix it. On day 10, the helmet fell on to the floor (I was not wearing it when it fell) and the side cushioning broke off. Now that was beyond repair and made me realize that cheap quality is what you get when you try to save money. If you are a regular city biker like I am, I would advise you to stay away from this product. Go to a local EMS store or something and get a much better helmet for about 20 bucks more.

The bracket does not tighten on the handle bar
I read the directions very carefully and adjusted the strap appropriately for my type of handle bar. But the bracket just does not lock tight and the light remains loose on the handle bar.  It can be easily rotated and I'm sure it would move if you hit bump.  I returned it.

faulty switch in cold weather
I've had this for about six months now, and it is finally dead.  About three months ago (when it started getting cold), the light would not turn off at the end of my ride - I had to open it and disengage the battery to turn it off.  Then about a month ago, it would suddenly shut off mid ride home and refuse to turn on again - scary!  Now it won't turn on at all - if I push the button hard the light will flicker, but as soon as I stop pushing it goes off.  <br /><br />I took this light off my bike whenever I parked it, but I do ride in the rain and snow occasionally; apparently this light can't handle that.  I really expected more for $39.

Not a real trainer
I'm a competitive cyclist and borrowed this trainer from a friend to use during the winter and wow....this thing is terrible. Yes, it is cheap, and yes, it allows you to bike inside, however, forget this thing if you are looking for a workout. There is no resistance and the only way to work up a sweat is to crank the roller tight on the tire but get ready for burning rubber and dramatically decreased tire life. Spend a few more dollars and get a real trainer. The frame is also flimsy, be careful getting out of the saddle for sprints: I've dropped the wheel out of the clamps on several occasions because the lateral flex of the frame is so bad. Spend your money elsewhere.
      
<!-- BOUNDARY -->
Pay more for a better trainer
I bought this trainer and tried it with my road bike a couple of times. It did not generate any noticable resistance.  I had to switch to the highest gear combination and still not enough.  It did generate lots of vibration and noise.  I suppose one could increase resistance by tightening the roller onto the bike tire...but that can tear up your tire pretty quickly.I am not big on indoor trainers but I had used a Cycle-ops fluid trainer before, and that gave far better resistance and was much quieter.  This is a low end trainer.  If I were buying another one (I sold mine), I would look for one with a bigger/stronger resistance mechanism.

Not such a good Christmas present.
I bought this set for my 16 year old son for Christmas.  We live in Utah and last night was the first time he got them out to go and hit a bucket of balls.  After about 15 minutes the club head of the biggest club flew off and went almost as far as the ball did.  Guess they should have used better glue!  I figured for the price that the set wasn't going to be all that good, but I thought it would last longer than 15 minutes.  Very disappointed and will not buy from Golf Outlet of America again.

Disappointing
The perks of buying the PC version according to Infinity Ward (IW):<br /><br />1. Text chatting. Now you can text chat to your buddies in-game while online, what fantastic innovation.<br /><br />2. Adjustable graphics setting -- gotta give them points for adding that feature, while console users are stuck with their 720/1080 resolution, you can max it up all the way depending on your hardware. Amazing stuff...although every game has had this feature since the beginning of PC gaming. <br /><br />3. The ability to use your mouse and keyboard. Now you can unplug your xbox controller and use your computer accessories for a more accurate FPS experience(!).<br /><br />4. You'll have a fantastic smooth time connecting to IWNet; its so perfect, it'll even give you XBox Live error messages.<br /><br />Now, the negatives: <br /><br />1. You're paying more for an inferior product. $60 vs $50. The consoles have a valid excuse for charging more -- $10.00 goes to the console manufacturer (Sony or Microsoft), Activision is just being greedy here; really quite unacceptable, especially in today's economy. <br /><br />2. Dedicated servers removed -- don't even get me started; I'm sure you've heard of the petition which is nearing 200,000 signatures to re-include dedicated servers. We're left with a terrible online experience. I played the first Modern Warfare (MW) on the PS3 which had peer to peer online play and it was disastrous. Expect drop outs and poor performance. The host of the game will always have the advantage because they have the better latency. <br /><br />3. No mods. This is surprising because so many other popular games were developed from mods including -- Counterstrike, Team-fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead. The only reason I can think of why IW/Activision would want to do such a thing would be to charge for content later on. I remember paying for 3 maps for the first MW -- and to tell you the truth, it really wasn't worth it. <br /><br />4. Steam required. When you install the game you are required to install the Steam platform and link it to an e-mail address, and your Steam username. This makes reselling the game next to impossible. <br /><br />5. Feels and plays more like a Modern Warfare 1.5 then a Modern Warfare 2.0; the graphics are alright for todays standard, but I was expecting a lot more from IW for a two year development cycle.<br /><br />6. Short single player. Since they've gimped the multiplayer aspect, and the single player can roughly be finished in 6-7 hours, I suggest you rent this on the console if you have one.<br /><br />7. Multiplayer only allows 9 vs 9 (18 player) matches. MW1 allows up to 64 -- does more mean more enjoyable? No, not necessarily, but at least there is choice and server admins were able to set it to their liking. <br /><br />Infinity Ward have really let their fans down. The multi-player made the original spectacular; with the removal of dedicated servers, competitive and fair play is dead.<br /><br />Business schools should take note because this would make a wonderful case study on how a company has ruined one of the most anticipated  franchise in such a short amount of time. MW2 was literally a license to print money for Activison/IW. With such a terrible management decision, reinstating dedicated servers will be the only hope to redeem themselves in the eyes of their consumers -- however I think this fiasco will not be easily forgotten.<br /><br />*** Update 11/18/09 <br /><br />Theres hope yet! Hackers have released a patch so you can start/join a dedicated server; its disgusting that this has to come from the underground scene and not Activision/IW. It seems that the hacked copies "freely" available over the Internet is now the superior version. <br /><br />Hackers have also found hidden modes via the console -- Global Thermonuclear War, One Flag CTF and VIP mode -- future downloadable content already in the game? How low you've fallen Activision/IW. <br /><br />*** Update 04/16/10<br /><br />I've given up on this game and probably this series for good -- The 'impenetrable' IWNet is plagued with hacks and cheats.  I suggest you all save your money and get Battlefield Bad Company 2 instead;  I've been enjoying the experience so far, its a game that involves more strategy and not your standard Modern Warfare, run and gun. Even the NY Times agrees that Bad Company 2 is a better game than Modern Warfare 2. [...]

Fun game, but shame on Activision and Infinity Ward
I actually bought this game even though it will be the last Infinity Ward game I support by purchasing. I've been a huge fan of said developer since Call of Duty 1, a PC exclusive, since day one. I've purchased every single Call of  Duty game developed by Infinity Ward over the years (including the expansion for CoD1 which wasn't developed by them). I never had a problem purchasing their products. Until now. This is the first time I've ever felt like a total tool and a moron for purchasing their "PC game". <br /><br />The game IS phenomenal. The graphics are noticeably improved over Modern Warfare 1, despite using the same graphics engine.  The overhaul is there, but a lot of current gen games have better visuals.  Sound design is great as always. There's a lot of recycled sounds and some new ones. Multiplayer is more of the same which isn't a bad thing, and the new co-op mode, from what I've played so far, seems fun. That's where my positive review ends. So basically you get more of the same, with slightly upgraded graphics.<br /><br />Here's where things turn bad.  For starters, Activision is charging $60 for this game, a move that completely goes against the grain of PC game pricing trends. Why? Because they can.  It's a business move, yes, but it's completely immoral and greedy. Corporate greed rears its ugly head.  Activision are the new EA.  You would think for $10 you would get, oh I don't know, a longer than average single player campaign right?  Well you don't.  If you thought Modern Warfare's campaign was short prepare to get slapped in the face with a campaign that can easily be completed in one session.  Bigger price, smaller experience. <br /><br />But most people are probably buying it for multiplayer anyway, so let's discuss that. Basically it's all been said before. This is a console port, right down to being limited to 9v9.  Want to get your clan together for some 32 vs. 32?  Nope.  16 vs 16?  Nope.  Oh come on then....at least give me some 12 v 12.  Sorry Charlie.  You get 9v9, just like the console. And just like the console you can't sort servers and pick where you want to play, you can't tweak game parameters via a developer console (another PC industry standard that Infinity Ward think's it's too good to implement), and, OH, no dedicated server support.  <br /><br />Frankly, I'm surprised the PC port even allowed me to play with a mouse and keyboard....<br /><br />It's painfully obvious that Infinity Ward prefer console development at this point (particularly the 360, which gets exclusive content before anybody else for the second game in row now), and it's even clearer that Activsion are greedy jerks.  <br /><br />It was a good run, Infinity Ward, but just like real life I won't associate with conceited, big-headed people. You won't get any more of my money.  MW2 gets one star for actually being a fun game, but insulting PC gamers by lying about features that never made it to the game (dedicated servers, more people per server than the console versions, etc), and the fact that your publisher is price gouging, keeps it from scoring higher.  <br /><br />** APPENDED MULTIPLAYER INFO **<br /><br />Okay so I've put in a few hours of multiplayer over the last few days and my worst fears were confirmed consistently.  Horrible latency just ruins the experience.  The game measures latency by a 4 bar system, similar to a mobile phone's signal strength.  So rather than seeing what your latency is as measured by miliseconds, you will see 1-4 bars.  Usually 3. Very rarely in my time playing MP did I ever have 4 bars, unless I was hosting the game.  I kept a close eye on other player's latencys(using the TAB button) and probably 70% of the players had 3 bars as well, with usually just 1 or 2 people having 4 bars - one of which was the player hosting the game - and a couple unfortunate fools who were somehow getting by with 2 bars or less. The person who hosts a game enjoys a SIGNIFICANT advantage over even those with 3 bars. The killcam proves it. Time after time after time I would get killed and, through the eyes of my opponent thanks to killcam, notice that there was about a half second difference between what I saw and what actually happened. Then I'd hit the TAB button and sure enough, that guy has 4 bars and I only have 3. Ridiculous. I have a fast enough internet connection (2 MB up), and don't notice these latency disadvantages with other shooters, so I have to put the blame solely on IWNET. <br /><br />It's really unfortunate and it's just the way it is which is sad as the multiplayer seems really fun and the levels are well thought out. The reality is if you want to play Multiplayer you're going to have to put up with a LOT of frustrating deaths, even if you get the drop on somebody, because he is enjoying a significant latency advantage.  <br /><br />The matchmaking is also broken.  It's supposed to match you based on latency (therefore location) and skill, so why was I constantly in matches with people with 1-2 bars of latency, versus lieutenants and generals when I was only a lowly specialist?  <br /><br />Bottom line is if you have either console and a PC, just get the console version because that's all you're getting on the PC. The PC version has no right disgracing the other games on your hard drive by pretending to be a PC game itself.  This game fails utterly. I would rate it half a star if I could.

I want a divorce.
When Call of Duty arrived on the PC scene, we were given an intense World War 2 first person shooter that blew away all other similar shooters at that time. For once, Medal of Honor had been matched and beaten at its own game. The sequel to Call of Duty, United Offensive, brought one of the best multiplayer World War 2 experiences ever seen in a game to the PC platform. Both titles were only<br />on PC, I would like to emphasize.<br /><br />Then came Call of Duty 2 and the Xbox 360. Since that point in time, Call of Duty on PC has never been the same. We were handed a game that looked better than the original but was lacking in multiplayer content and had minimally improved single-player. By the time the developers had stuck a "3" to the end of the title, the PC platform was nowhere to be found. Completely abandoned. Left to dry.<br /><br />But PC gamers were thrown a couple bones with the releases of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and the most recent PC Call of Duty game, World at War. Finally, we had the games back on our platform. They weren't the best in the world, but they were solid experiences all around. Again, the single player had dimwitted respawning A.I. foes and did little to give us an innovative experience, but the multiplayer in each games provided solid, replay-value-packed shooting that could hardly be looked down upon.<br /><br />And now, here we are again, going through rough times. She and I just aren't making ends meet anymore, if you know what I mean. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a complete disgrace to the PC platform. Yes, unlike several years ago in the case of Call of Duty 3, we actually have a Call of Duty game on our platform and for that we perhaps should be grateful; but even with that being said, it's difficult to cope with what exactly is happening here. There are so many negative points surrounding Modern Warfare 2, I would probably be sprouting grey hairs on my head by the time I was finished pointing out each of them. Instead, I'll get straight to the points. And there are many of them, so bare with me.<br /><br />What should normally be a $50 game at launch is now $60. Suddenly, we're being charged as much as the console kids for this game. What should normally be a PC-optimized port with support for dedicated servers, mods to change player limits and gameplay experiences, and more, is instead one in which we have no dedicated servers, no modification tools, no ability to extend the maximum amount of players in a server, no ability to record demos for the sake of footage and server moderation and administration, and even no unique PC features other than mouse control, text chat, and the ability to change graphical options. Yes, most of which were present in Wolfenstein 3D in 1992. And now, the icing on the cake: When we're not struggling to play the online portion of the game while leeching off another bum's connection, we can instead feast on a handful-of-hours, rinse-&-repeat single-player experience that features little to no replay value due to its linear, scripted gameplay.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the last straw for us PC gamers. We deserve more, because Call of Duty originated on our platform and if not for us, Modern Warfare 2 would not exist today. The heart and soul of Call of Duty should still remain embedded in PCs all over the world, but instead Infinity Ward has taken the path of ignorance and downright disrespect towards those who helped make their franchise possible. For these deeds, they can shove their money being horded from console gamers where the sun doesn't shine.<br /><br />I want a divorce.

Disappointing
I beat the game already. Its pretty disappointing to have paid 60 dollars for 6 hours of fun. As there is a crappy multiplayer system for this game, there is 0 replay value. You'll get better bang for your buck by going to the movie theater 5 times instead of playing this overpriced game. <br /><br />Infinity Ward, you can do better. Your multiplayer system is a joke. Lack of Modding capabilities is a step back. Blatant contempt for a fan base is pretty lame as well. I never thought that I would dislike a company more than EA, but congrats, you've done it.

disappointment
I am a huge fan of the original Modern Warfare. I purchased it for Windows and then for the Mac when it was released. I've been playing the Multiplayer for several years now and I've even gotten several of my friends to purchase a copy so we could play online. I was excited to see the new MW2 and preordered. I should have waited. The multiplayer is a complete disappointment. No dedicated servers, no control at all for the user base. If you liked the original MW multiplayer experience, do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.

Not Balanced for Fun
This game is a port.<br /><br />no dedicated servers so most games are 6v6 and max for the game is 9v9<br />no mod tools so there will be no custom maps or mods<br />can't lean anymore, since this is a straight port they didn't even enable it for PC.<br />IWNet sucks, they even left in the bars from consoles to show ping instead of numbers, because that way you can't tell how bad you are lagging.<br /><br />Bought every COD title, ever.  Bought some numerous times when I couldn't find my CD key when reinstalling windows.<br /><br />Where my friend works, xbox sold out, ps3 only has a few left, and PC hasn't sold a single copy.  Don't expect a lot of people to be on this IWNet for PC. I expect it will be dead in 2 months like every other abortion of a PC game that tries to do PC multiplayer without dedicated servers.  Not to mention without custom mods and maps the game will get boring fast.<br /><br />Total failure.

NO DEDICATED SERVER = FAIL
No 32 man servers?  Who is going to host?  WTF warring on MW2 will not happen.  Quick survey of 120+ COD clans, ZERO - EXACTLY ZERO clans plan on creating a MW2 faction.  Heck most of these have LFD factions for goodness sake.<br /><br />No multiplayer = fail.

Don't make the same mistake I did
This is my first review, I normally don't review things but I had to add a reasonable voice for potential buyers who are on the fence.<br /><br />I bought this game disappointed that there were no dedicated servers (and thus no matches with lots of people or little lag), but hoping that IWnet would meet or exceed my expectations.  It didn't.  Gameplay is horrible.  I'm bored after an hour or so.  6v6 doesn't cut it.  Playing with random people all of the time doesn't cut it.  This is not fun.<br /><br />MW1 entertained me for dozens if not hundreds of hours.  I've already lost interest in this game even though it graphically is very well done.  Its hard to believe that such a good game (MW1) was turned into such a POS; it takes real effort to turn a masterpiece into unplayable garbage, but IW managed to do it.  <br /><br />I'd return this game in an instant if I could.  There is truth to all of the rants people have posted online.  Do not buy this.

Let this be a lesson in hubris
The reason console games cost a little more is because of the expensive, proprietary manufacturing process (Sony, Nintendo) and license fees (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo).<br /><br />There are no proprietary technologies associated with manufacturing a PC game.  There are no license fees to the platform.<br /><br />This was an attempt by a greedy company to capitalize on the success of COD4 and the hype of MW2's release by charging above-market costs.  The problem with hype is that you have to live up to it, which this game clearly does not.<br /><br />Additionally, it looks like they made a lot of people mad with the lack of dedicated servers.  People play this game on home networks with asymmetric internet access:  your upload is much slower than your download.  This means that to host a game without a dedicated server, someone has to use their slow upload bandwidth.  Again, this looks to me like an attempt to control cost by not having to pay for and maintain dedicated servers and bandwidth without regard for performance.<br /><br />Such a greedy move should be met with no less than abject failure.<br /><br />So, I'll wait until I see this on the 5 dollar rack, which should be by about next week sometime based on everyone's feedback.<br /><br />Activision:  If you read this, please learn from your mistake, and understand that you can't charge extra money for hype nor lame.<br /><br />

What if I play single player campaign and could care less about multiplayer vs mode?  Is it really worth $60 for 5 hours of play?

Overpriced for the lack of content
My title says it all. This PC game is $10 more than the traditional price. If the release of Left 4 Dead showed us anything, it is that colored bars representing ping and automatic match making do no sit well with the PC community. The lack of dedicated servers, the inability to change the field of view, lack of mod and custom map support, and removing the ability to lean your character left and right have made me decide to not purchase this game. A five hour single player game, with heavily pruned multiplayer is not worth $60, nor $50. I wholeheartedly denounce Infinity Ward for releasing this travesty of a game.

greed + superiority complex
1. We all know that a PC game is $50 or less, not $60... = G R E E D.<br />Boycott the greed, use a torrent<br /><br />2. We have never experienced such a blatant "Go jump off a bridge if you don't like it" attitude from these IDIOTIC corporations who feel that they KNOW what the people want, therefore we don't NEED to listen to them = superiority complex<br /><br />I will never buy any P.0.$ from activision or their backwater partner in the future. All of the outrage and anger being demonstrated by the many PC fans will go unheard and is ultimately pointless and a waste of time. In the end, they don't NEED to listen, they just do what they KNOW what's best.<br /><br />Upsetting to say the least, it's like were dealing with some dibunk government, and were just the peasants without a voice.<br /><br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !

Bait and Switch - Do not buy!
I pre-ordered this game with high expectations.  Bait and Switch at its finest.  They didn't announce the lack of Dedicated Server support for PC players until very recently (I pre-ordered back in April or May).  The excessive lag, servers dropping mid-game, no Dedicated Servers, and no way to kick vote players will be the death of this game!

Nothing less than the continued erosion of consumer freedoms
IW is stripping long-standing consumer benefits with its PC game.  Purchasing the game is nothing less than a declaration of you willingness to loss those benefits, and you're communicating that fact not just to IW, but to all of the publishers who are watching closely to see just how much they can get away with offering gamers a lesser exchange for their money.  And don't pretend for a moment that this is just about PC gaming.  The trend in all of gaming is away from game ownership and towards gaming as a rented service.<br /><br />The publishers' utopian wetdream is a market where the gamer owns nothing.  They pay explicitly for every hour of gameplay they experience, and even then are only allowed to play within the strict and permanent boundaries erected by the publisher.  And when the publisher decides you should stop playing an old game because it is no longer profitable enough, they terminate it and offer you the 'choice' of buying a new game, or to not play at all.<br /><br />I've read a lot of commentary that is dismissive if not outright disparaging of the passionate furor exhibited by a select few over the MW2 issue, saying things like, "what's the problem, just let the market decide."  Yes, absolutely, the market should decide, but don't "let" it happen.  Realize that you, as a game-purchasing consumer, *ARE* the market.  The market is nothing but the cumulative purchasing choices of all consumers.  The only power you have as a consumer is to accept or reject the exchange offered by publishers.  If you choose to purchase MW2, you are personally endorsing the continued erosion of value that gamers receive in their exchange with publishers. <br /><br />A lot of people think that they can complain about issues like this, but then buy the product anyway, and somehow that influences publishers to react to their complaints.  The only thing that influences them is WHETHER OR NOT YOU BUY THE GAME!  Bitching about something and buying the game is equivalent to buying the game and saying nothing -- it's equivalent even to buying the game and saying "Great job guys, keep up the good work and be sure to strip away more of my consumer benefits next time."   Because the only thing they hear is the sound of you purchasing the game - registering yet another gamer tacitly accepting reduced benefits, lowering the standard by which all publishers measure the market for all games.<br /><br />There are more games than I could play in a lifetime, and no single one of them is great enough that it's worth trading away the freedoms that I want to enjoy as a gamer.  The only way I can compel publishers to respect and uphold those freedoms is by using my own incremental market vote to communicate the value of those freedoms, and to hope that others do the same in sufficient volume to convince publishers in no uncertain terms that it's more profitable to provide them than it is to take them away.

60 USD for a demo?
If you are a true gamer, forget about buying this game.<br />7 hours in solo gameplay, and it is done. Because there is not dedicated servers, multiplayer always sucks. <br />You have to install steam in order to play it, so you cannot resell it.<br />There's no console, there is no vote (so you can't kick players). No mods, seems like a demo to me. When they actually make an entire game, maybe I'll think about it but 60 USD for a demo is too expensive.

Lacks many features from it's predecessor.
The sequel to the very sucessful Modern Warfare sadly lacks many of the features that made the first game great on the PC platform. Such features include:<br /><br />- No dedicated server support: In Modern Warfare 2, all games will be hosted by players on a peer-to-peer system. This severely affects multiplayer balance, as the host will always have the advantage of having zero latency, while other players will suffer from increased latency when compared to a dedicated server, since the latter gives you the option of selecting a server close to you.<br /><br />- Maximum of 18 players per match: This is a consequence of the above. Since games will be hosted by players, you are limited to how much upload bandwidth a home connection can provide. The first Modern Warfare could support up to 64 players per match.<br /><br />- No console commands: You won't be able to change the game's settings to match your gaming setup, such as changing the Field of View (FOV) from 65, the default value for Xbox 360 games, to something better suited for PC gaming.<br /><br />I see no reason to justify the inflated $60 price tag for a game that is in many aspects inferior to it's predecessor. It's clear that Activision has decided to create a quick, cheap port of the Xbox 360 game instead of taking their time to deliver an experience that matches the (reasonable) expectations of the platform.<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone to buy this game for the PC. There are other developers that still focus on providing good gameplay on the PC, and those should be supported. Instead, if you must, buy this game for the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, as you'll be getting the same experience, and very likely, much better support for the game.<br /><br />

Infinity Ward has lost me as a customer forever.

Great Console Game...
...which is to say it's a horrible PC game. Regardless of what the "gamers" say on these reviews that rate it anything other than a 1* or IGN's laughable 95% review of this game for PC, the PC version is a prime example of why it will be pirated, and why I don't really care if it is.<br /><br />First off, this is an actual good improvement of MW2. Everything is greatly tweaked, everything looks nice, and the co-op is top notch. But if you plan on making a 5* product on the PC, IW, you can't cut features and then raise the price. There's absolutely no excuse for reason for charging $60 for this game. That's a -1*. Greed should never be rewarded. Then there's the lack of dedicated servers. P2P isn't the worst thing ever, but it's not good. It really is only as good as the host. That's another star removed. Then we took out mods. And the reason this was taken out is because now PC gamers have the "privledge" of spending $10 for 3-4 maps when they need some more cash. In other words, mods were taken out to solely make money. Greed. -2* for the greed and the removal of mods. That leaves us with 1*. That's about all this game is. A 1* title on the PC. Console, easily a 5*. Not on the PC.<br /><br />I hope the pirates manage to hack the netcode and allow dedicated servers and mods. IW deserves to get burned on this one.
